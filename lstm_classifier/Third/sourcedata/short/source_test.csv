"In April 2005, we spotted a tearjerker on the Internet about a mother who gave up one of her eyes to a son who had lost one of his at an early age. By February 2007 the item was circulating in e-mail in the following shortened version:  My mom only had one eye. I hated her… She was such an embarrassment. She cooked for students and teachers to support the family. There was this one day during elementary school where my mom came to say hello to me. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I ignored her, threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day at school one of my classmates said, “EEEE, your mom only has one eye!” I wanted to bury myself. I also wanted my mom to just disappear. I confronted her that day and said, “If you’re only gonna make me a laughing stock, why don’t you just die?” My mom did not respond… I didn’t even stop to think for a second about what I had said, because I was full of anger. I was oblivious to her feelings. I wanted out of that house, and have nothing to do with her. So I studied real hard, got a chance to go abroad to study. Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. I had kids of my own. I was happy with my life, my kids and the comforts. Then one day, my Mother came to visit me. She hadn’t seen me in years and she didn’t even meet her grandchildren. When she stood by the door, my children laughed at her, and I yelled at her for coming over uninvited. I screamed at her, “How dare you come to my house and scare my children! GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!! !” And to this, my mother quietly answered, “Oh, I’m so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address,” and she disappeared out of sight. One day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. So I lied to my wife that I was going on a business trip. After the reunion, I went to the old shack just out of curiosity. My neighbors said that she died. I did not shed a single tear. They handed me a letter that she had wanted me to have. My dearest son, I think of you all the time. I’m sorry that I came to your house and scared your children. I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I may not be able to even get out of bed to see you. I’m sorry that I was a constant embarrassment to you when you were growing up. You see……..when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn’t stand watching you having to grow up with one eye. So I gave you mine. I was so proud of my son who was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye. With all my love to you, Your mother. In its earlier incarnation, the story identified by implication its location as Korea through statements made by both the mother and the son (the son’s “I left my mother and came to Seoul” and the mother’s “I won’t visit Seoul anymore”). It also supplied a reason for the son’s behavior when his mother arrived unexpectedly to visit him (“My little girl ran away, scared of my mom’s eye” and “I screamed at her, ‘How dare you come to my house and scare my daughter!'”). A further twist was provided in the original: rather than gaining the news of his mother’s death from neighbors (who hand him her letter), the son instead discovered the woman who bore him lying dead on the floor of what used to be his childhood home, her missive to him clutched in her lifeless hand: Give your parents roses while they are alive, not deadMY mom only had one eye. I hated her … she was such an embarrassment. My mom ran a small shop at a flea market. She collected little weeds and such to sell … anything for the money we needed she was such an embarrassment. There was this one day during elementary school … It was field day, and my mom came. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day at school … “your mom only has one eye?!? !” … And they taunted me. I wished that my mom would just disappear from this world so I said to my mom, “mom … Why don’t you have the other eye?! If you’re only going to make me a laughingstock, why don’t you just die?!! !” my mom did not respond … I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it felt good to think that I had said what I’d wanted to say all this time… maybe it was because my mom hadn’t punished me, but I didn’t think that I had hurt her feelings very badly. That night… I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake me. I took a look at her, and then turned away. Because of the thing I had said to her earlier, there was something pinching at me in the corner of my heart. Even so, I hated my mother who was crying out of her one eye. So I told myself that I would grow up and become successful. Because I hated my one-eyed mom and our desperate poverty… then I studied real hard. I left my mother and came to Seoul and studied, and got accepted in the Seoul University with all the confidence I had. Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. Then I had kids, too… now I’m living happily as a successful man. I like it here because it’s a place that doesn’t remind me of my mom. This happiness was getting bigger and bigger, when… what?! Who’s this…it was my mother… still with her one eye. It felt as if the whole sky was falling apart on me. My little girl ran away, scared of my mom’s eye. And I asked her, “who are you? !” “I don’t know you!! !” as if trying to make that real. I screamed at her, “How dare you come to my house and scare my daughter!” “GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!! !” and to this, my mother quietly answered, “oh, I’m so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address,” and she disappeared out of sight. Thank goodness… she doesn’t recognize me… I was quite relieved. I told myself that I wasn’t going to care, or think about this for the rest of my life. Then a wave of relief came upon me… One day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. So, lying to my wife that I was going on a business trip, I went. After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that I used to call a house… just out of curiosity there, I found my mother fallen on the cold ground. But I did not shed a single tear. She had a piece of paper in her hand…. it was a letter to me. My son… I think my life has been long enough now… And… I won’t visit Seoul anymore… but would it be too much to ask if I wanted you to come visit me once in a while? I miss you so much… and I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I decided not to go to the school. …for you… and I’m sorry that I only have one eye, and I was an embarrassment for you. You see, when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. as a mom, I couldn’t stand watching you having to grow up with only one eye… so I gave you mine… I was so proud of my son that was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye. I was never upset at you for anything you did… the couple times that you were angry with me, I thought to myself, ‘it’s because he loves me…’ my son. Oh, my son… I don’t want you to cry for me, because of my death. My son, I love you my son, I love you so much. With all modern medical technology, transplantation of the eyeball is still impossible. The optic nerve isn’t an ordinary nerve, but instead an inset running from the brain. Modern medicine isn’t able to “connect” an eyeball back to brain after an optic nerve has been severed, let alone transplant the eye from a different person. (The only exception is the cornea, the transparent part in front of the eye: corneas are transplanted to replace injured and opaque ones.) We won’t try to comment on whether any surgeon would accept an eye from a living donor for transplant into another — we’ll leave that to others who are far more knowledgeable about medical ethics and transplant procedures. But we will note that the plot device of a mother’s dramatic sacrifice for the sake of her child’s being revealed in a written communication delivered after her demise appears in another legend about maternal love: the 2008 tale about a woman who left a touching message on her cell phone even as life ebbed from her as she used her body to shield the tot during an earthquake. Giving up one’s own life for a loved one is central to a 2005 urban legend about a boy on a motorcycle who has his girlfriend hug him one last time and put on his helmet just before the crash that kills him and spares her. Returning to the “notes from the dead” theme is the 1995 story about a son who discovers only through a posthumous letter from his mother what their occasional dinner “dates” had meant to her. Another legend we’re familiar with features a meme used in the one-eyed mother story (the coming to light of the enduring love of the person who died for the completely unworthy person she’d lavished it on), but that one involves a terminally ill woman and her cheating husband. In it, an about-to-be-spurned wife begs the adulterous hoon she’d married to stick around for another 30 days and to carry her over the threshold of their home once every day of that month as her way of keeping him around long enough for her to kick the bucket and thus spare their son the knowledge that his parents were on the verge of divorce.",1
"""That means the great majority of Americans stay within the advised limit of two drinks a day for men and one for women, according to the study that appeared in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “And in fact, most adults don’t drink at all on any given day,” said lead author Patricia Guenther, a nutritionist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. “But the fact remains that it is a significant public health problem that many people do drink to excess.”  Guenther said that members of the committee that drafted the current USDA guidelines on alcohol consumption wanted to know how many adults exceeded the limits. She and her colleagues collected data from a nationally representative survey on health and nutrition, which included about 5,400 adults over age 21. Among other things, each was asked how much alcohol they drank the previous day. The researchers found that 64 percent of men and 79 percent of women said they drank no alcohol at all that day, and another 18 percent of men and 10 percent of women drank within the recommended amounts. Nine percent of men said they had three to four drinks the day before and 8 percent of women said they drank two to three alcoholic beverages, the researchers said. The heaviest drinkers of all were the 8 percent of men who had five or more drinks, and 3 percent of women who had four or more. “Overall the study confirms that rates of unhealthy alcohol use in the U.S. are significant,” said Jennifer Mertens, a research medical scientist at Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, California, who was not part of the study. Regularly drinking more than recommended levels is “linked to increased alcohol-related problems,” Mertens wrote in an email to Reuters Health. “Binge drinking (more than four drinks on any one day for men and more than three on any one day for women and older adults) even one time can increase the risk of injury from falls, motor vehicle accidents and other accidents,” she added. Among men, the 31-to-30-year-old age group had the most heavy drinkers, at 22 percent. Ammonal women, the heaviest drinkers - 12 percent - were between 51 and 70 years old. Guenther said that’s important to note because it highlights that heavy drinking is not just part of life among the college set. “People need to be aware that there are people of all ages who drink to excess,” she told Reuters Health, adding that the new study is also important because it may help people recognize whether they themselves are drinking more than recommended. """"There are people who don't realize that they are drinking more than what's beneficial to their health,"""" she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/X1NVtW""",0
"Craig Shergold is real and             in 1989 when he was 9-years old, a campaign was started on his             behalf to try to break the Guinness world record for greeting cards. The Make-A-Wish Foundation had nothing to do             with it, however, and Craig is now a 22-year old young man who is             alive and well. The story began in 1988 when Craig first complained of             earaches. Antibiotics didn’t help and one day when his             condition seemed desperate, Craig was taken to a hospital for tests,             which revealed a brain tumor. He was so ill his parents were             warned he might not survive. Surgery removed the tumor, but it             kept growing and the outlook was not good. When the             staff at Royal Marsden Hospital in London saw how much get-well             cards cheered it up, it was suggested that a card project be started             to break the Guinness world record. The London office of the             Children’s Wish Foundation (not Make-a-Wish) got on board and the             British press gave visibility to the story. The old Guinness             mark was slightly more than a million cards. That record was             broken by Craig within a few months, but the cards kept             coming. Then along the way, the rumor said he wanted business             cards, not greeting cards. The mail load got so heavy that             Craig’s family ultimately halted mail delivery to their home and             chose to move to a different residence. Now, Craig’s old             address has its own postal code and more than 350 million pieces of             mail have been received. Volunteers remove the stamps, which             are sold, and the mail is then recycled, with the proceeds going to             cancer research. The folks at Guinness have retired the             greeting card category. Although Craig and his family became overwhelmed by the volume of             mail, they ultimately became grateful for one aspect of the             visibility. Word of Craig’s condition reached Virginia             billionaire John Kluge, chairman of Metromedia. He arranged             for Craig to be flown to the U.S. for life-saving surgery at the             University of Virginia Medical Center. A PAX-TV movie about Craig was the result of producer Robert Woods having             received the rumor and sending a card to Craig. Through that,             he learned that Craig was no longer a little boy, but a healthy             young man and the story struck him as a good one for the screen. He and the family have hopes that the film will help quiet the             rumor. updated 11/18/01 For more information:Make A Wish Foundation Comments",1
"Results of two Phase III trials found bitopertin in combination with antipsychotic therapy did not significantly reduce negative symptoms after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. A third late-stage study is ongoing. Roughly 26 million people are affected by schizophrenia worldwide, but current treatment options for the disorder’s negative symptoms - which include social withdrawal, lack of motivation and reduced emotional reactivity - are limited. “These results are disappointing for people with negative symptoms because more effective treatments are needed for these debilitating effects of schizophrenia,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer and global head of product development. The data are also a blow for Roche, which has upped its investment in neuroscience in recent years as it looks to branch out beyond its core cancer expertise. It is currently running late-stage studies in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. Many large pharmaceutical companies including Merck, Novartis and AstraZeneca have cut back on research in the area as new drugs prove hard to find. The success rate for brain drugs in Phase III is poor, averaging around 50 percent against 50-80 percent for other disease areas. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Fabian Wenner said the results showed Roche was taking more time to succeed in new fields outside of oncology, which he said would be critical to secure sustainable growth in the long term. In recent years Roche has scrapped drugs to treat diabetes and boost levels of “good” high-density cholesterol. While a successful treatment for schizophrenia’s negative symptoms could have notched up more than a billion dollars a year in sales, many analysts had modest expectations for bitopertin. Current consensus forecasts point to annual sales of $407 million by 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis. Roche is conducting three additional Phase III studies investigating bitopertin for sub-optimally controlled symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. The drugmaker said it would await the data from its remaining studies before deciding on the next steps for the drug.",0
"There is no discussion of cost in the article. The benefit of eribulin over various treatments chosen by the physicians was clearly stated in the article. “The researchers found that among patients whose cancer had spread, those who took the drug (eribulin) lived a median of 2.5 months longer than those who received a physician-chosen treatment — 13.1 months versus 10.6 months.” Mixed bag. While the story points out the most common side effects, fatigue and depletion of white blood cells, occurred in both study groups, readers aren’t given any sense of how common these were. In fact, they were quite common: these side effects occurred in 54% of those on eribulin and 40% of patients in the treatment of physician’s choice group. This is why we expect stories to quantify harms. To its credit, the article does note that the most common adverse event that caused women to drop out of the eribulin arm was neuropathy, or numbness and pain caused by nerve damage – and it notes a 5% study drop out rate. The article does a good job of noting several times that the women in the trial, known as EMBRACE, all had metastatic breast cancer that had already been heavily treated with various chemotherapies. And it did give the number of women in each arm of the trial and at least mentioned that this was a “global phase 3 study” – although that’s expecting readers to grasp what that really means. We’ll call it barely satisfactory. It’s always a judgment call for journalists on where to draw the line on details to include or leave out. But some that maybe should have been included: The article also fails to mention potential weaknesses of the trial design that were highlighted in the study. The authors of the study pointed out that the treatment of physician’s choice group included several different chemotherapies precluding detailed comparisons with eribulin. There is no disease-mongering. The article includes quotes from an independent expert, Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and from a related editorial also published in The Lancet. The story points out that the study was funded by the company that markets eribulin but it should have further noted that several of the authors of the study received grants or consultancy fees from Eisai. In addition, five of the study authors are employees of Eisai. We’ll rule this one barely satisfactory. The survival benefit for women who were treated with eribulin is clearly presented. The article also included the definition of the treatment of the physician’s choice that was used by the study authors. The article does not report that eribulin, the drug studied, received approval in the United States based on the results of the study. Eribulin is approved for patients who have previously been treated for metastatic breast cancer with at least two chemotherapies, including an anthracycline and a taxane. As a result, the availability of the drug is unclear to readers. Information about drug approval and availability is valuable for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The article establishes the novelty of eribulin by quoting from the study authors, as well as from a related editorial in The Lancet and from an independent authority, Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Dr. Bernik said “This drug shows much promise, and it should certainly be included in additional trials to fully establish its benefit.” The article did not rely solely on a news release.",0
"Bayer shares tumbled more than 12 percent on Wednesday after a unanimous jury in San Francisco federal court found Roundup to be a “substantial factor” in causing California resident Edwin Hardeman’s non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The jury decision was a blow to Bayer after the judge in the Hardeman case, at the company’s request, had split the trial, severely limiting evidence plaintiffs could present in the first phase. Tuesday’s defeat on terms considered advantageous to Bayer sets up the second phase to be even tougher and limits the grounds on which the company could appeal any final verdict, the experts said. “The fact that Bayer lost this trial despite it being set up in the most favorable way for them is a huge setback,” said Thomas Rohback, a Connecticut-based defense lawyer. Bayer in a statement on Tuesday said it stood behind the safety of Roundup and was confident the evidence in the second trial phase would show that Monsanto’s conduct was appropriate and the company not liable for Hardeman’s cancer. The company, which bought Monsanto last year, on Wednesday declined to comment beyond that statement. Tuesday’s finding did not address liability, which will be determined following the second trial phase that began on Wednesday. Bayer denies glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer. The German company faces more than 11,200 lawsuits over the popular weed killer. Last August, following the first Roundup trial, a California state court jury issued a $289 million verdict against the company. Two weeks after that verdict, which was later reduced to $78 million and is being appealed, Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann reassured analysts that the company had a new legal strategy based on focusing jurors on the scientific evidence. “Bayer and the joint litigation team are working to ensure that, going forward, this overwhelming science will get the full consideration it deserves,” Baumann said in an Aug. 23 conference call. There is a lot at stake for Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto last year for $63 billion. Though Bayer does not break out sales figures for Roundup, glyphosate is the world’s most widely used weed killer, and Roundup is the leading brand. Bayer’s new strategy was focused on keeping out plaintiffs’ allegations that the company improperly influenced scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of Roundup. Bayer has denied it acted inappropriately and said in public statements following the August verdict that it thought the jury was inflamed by the claims of corporate misconduct. Vince Chhabria, the San Francisco federal judge overseeing the Hardeman case, agreed with the company’s argument that such evidence was a “distraction” from the scientific question of whether glyphosate causes cancer. He agreed to split the trial in a January order. Had Bayer had won the first phase, there would have been no second phase looking at company liability. Now that it has lost, almost all of the previously excluded evidence can be presented to the jury. Plaintiffs’ lawyers hit Bayer with those allegations in their opening statements for the second phase on Wednesday. Aimee Wagstaff, one of Hardeman’s lawyers, said Monsanto influenced the science around Roundup through its “cozy” relationship with regulators. Bayer could convince the jury in the second phase that, despite their finding that Roundup played a substantial role in  Hardeman’s cancer, the company was not liable. Experts said that was unlikely. “They could present evidence of how careful they were in developing Roundup, but that’s an uphill battle given that the scientific evidence was their strongest argument,” said Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. A lawyer for Bayer on Wednesday argued that Bayer could not be held liable because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other regulators worldwide, approved Roundup without a cancer warning. If the Hardeman trial had not been split and a final verdict went against Bayer, the company might have been able to appeal any damages award to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals by claiming the jury had been improperly swayed by inflammatory evidence, said Lori Jarvis, a Virginia-based mass tort defense lawyer. That argument will now be difficult to make. “It would not be surprising at all for the 9th Circuit to uphold what the jury did in this case, particularly given the great effort Chhabria put into creating a level playing field for Monsanto,” Jarvis said. Some lawyers said Bayer could still argue on appeal that plaintiffs’ experts and their scientific evidence were insufficient and statistically invalid and should not have been admitted at trial. But they noted the 9th Circuit, which oversees the San Francisco federal court, has generally been permissive in allowing expert testimony. However, experts said it was probably too soon to write off Bayer’s legal strategy, noting future Roundup cases could result in different outcomes. “It’s a relatively early phase in this litigation as a whole and we just need to see more trials to understand Bayer’s liability,” said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School.",0
"On or around 29 March 2016, several unreliable web sites reported that Muslim men in San Bernardino had fired upon hikers in a nearby park, and that the news media (in complicity with local police) covered up the incident (for unspecified reasons): A heavily armed group of men with Middle Eastern appearance was arrested two hours ago outside Los Angeles after opening fire upon Hikers and Campers in a large State Park in the area. According to the victim/witness, there were two groups of men, about 15 per group, armed with heavy weapons, who began shouting “Allah u Akbar” and started firing. The firing allegedly lasted upwards of TWO HOURS before police were able to find callers in the vast California parkland. When police were responding, one group of 15 or so men took-off into the hills, while the other group was captured by police. CALIFORNIA TERROR COVER UP? Heavily-armed Muslims shouting “Allahu Akbar” open fire on campers and hikers in a park. Cops arrest them, then let them go! A heavily armed group of Middle Eastern looking Muslim men was arrested outside Los Angeles after opening fire upon hikers and campers in a large State Park in the area. According to these sites, a group of heavily armed, apparently “Muslim” men (shouting “Allahu Akbar”) shot at hikers and campers in the Deep Creek Hot Springs area of Apple Valley, California. Police responded to the scene and tracked down the armed individuals, but then decided to let them go, and the media supposedly completely ignored the bizarre incident. However, the Los Angeles Times (a major newspaper local to the incident, but somehow unaware of the coverup) published an article on the subject on 29 March 2016. According to the Times, police investigated the reports of shooting, and the armed men they interviewed at the scene were co-operative. No part of that reporting described the men as Muslim, claimed that they had fired at anyone, or indicated that anyone in the group shouted “Allahu Akbar”: The FBI was continuing to question people after receiving reports from campers that a group of armed men in a remote part of Apple Valley fired hundreds of shots Sunday morning. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies and an FBI agent responded to the area known as Deep Creek Hot Springs after reports of gunshots and chanting in the predawn hours, officials said. According to law enforcement sources, 17 men of Middle Eastern descent were detained. But none were arrested or charged in connection with shooting firearms and they cooperated with deputies, authorities said. Also apparently ignorant of the suppression of news reporting on the incident were Los Angeles television station KCAL, the Victorville Daily Press, and the Press-Enterprise, all of whom also reported on the incident: The men had handguns, a rifle and a shotgun, all of which were registered with the California Department of Justice except for the rifle. Rifles and shotguns do not require registration in California, [Sgt. David] Rodriguez said. The men cooperated with the investigation, and none were found to have a criminal history, authorities said. Deputies also contacted several hikers in the area, but none reported seeing the men shooting guns. Rodriguez said deputies will not be doing any further investigation into the incident. The Press-Enterprise article also described initial reports of the men’s appearance as “inaccurate,” according to police in San Bernardino: Someone called 911 about 8:25 a.m. to report seeing five to seven “subjects wearing turbans” shooting various firearms and hearing more than 100 gunshots, the release said. Deputies later learned that the caller’s description of the men was not accurate, and that one man was wearing a scarf. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Office also issued a press release about the incident on 27 March 2016, which read: DATE/TIME: March 27, 2016 / 8:25am INCIDENT: Incident LOCATION: Deep Creek Hot Springs, Apple Valley On Sunday, March 27, 2016, at about 8:25 am, deputies from the Victor Valley Sheriff’s Station responded to reports of shots fired in the Deep Creek Hot Springs area of Apple Valley. The reporting party told the 911 operator more than 100 shots were heard and 5 to 7 subjects wearing turbans were seen in the area shooting assault rifles, handguns, and shotguns. Due to this being a very rural location, Sheriff’s Aviation assisted to conduct an area check for the alleged shooters while patrol units from the Victor Valley Station responded. The sheriff’s helicopter arrived and located a group of males, 17 total, walking away from the creek carrying back packs and other items. Deputies from Apple Valley, Hesperia, and Victorville Police Stations also responded to assist. Shortly after deputies arrived to the area the subjects were detained and searched. Several handguns, a rifle, and a shotgun were found during a search of the backpacks and bedding the subjects had been carrying. The subjects were very cooperative and were interviewed. A local FBI agent responded to assist with interviews. A records check of the subjects, their weapons, and their vehicles was completed. The records check revealed none of the subjects had a criminal history or outstanding warrants, the weapons were registered with the Department of Justice except for the rifle, and the vehicles were also registered. Several hikers were contacted, but none of them witnessed the guns being fired. There was no evidence found that a crime had been committed by any of the subjects who were detained and they were released. As the official incident report stated, no one in the area questioned by police said they had witnessed guns being fired nor reported having been fired upon. Police found and interviewed the group of men in question and discovered that their possession of firearms was in compliance with the law and that none of them had any outstanding warrants or criminal histories. While the caller who reported the men to police claimed five to seven of the men wore turbans and fired assault rifles, police didn’t mention turbans or other headwear, and they noted that the men were in possession of “handguns, a rifle, and a shotgun” (but no “assault rifles”). No credible news reports made any mention of the “Allahu Akbar” claim, and no witnesses stated they had been “shot at” by the men while hiking or camping. Also, the police report described the men only as “males,” not “Middle Eastern males” or “Muslim males.” The web site that started this rumor was Superstation95, which is not a “superstation” at all but rather a repository of misinformation from Hal Turner, who in 2010 was sentenced to 33 months in prison for making death threats against three federal judges. (The name listed in the site’s Contact page is Turner’s criminal lawyer.) That same site similarly (and baselessly) claimed that a woman who crashed into pedestrians on the Las Vegas strip in December 2015 had shouted “Allahu Akbar” and was subsequently rebuked by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department for spreading false information: @PatriotBroker This is false and we have addressed the misinformation with @SuperStation95. — LVMPD (@LVMPD) December 22, 2015  Superstation95 also falsely claimed that the December 2015 San Bernardino mass shooting occurred because the shooter was offended that pork was served at a Christmas party, that all cargo ships ceased transporting goods in January 2016, and that seafood was contaminated with “cancerous tumors” following the Fukushima nuclear disaster.",1
"A particularly yucky food tale from the early 1990s was a favorite of high school and college students and said a lot about how we feel about fast food:  A woman goes into a fast food restaurant and orders a chicken sandwich with no mayo. She bites into it, tastes some kind of sauce, and looking at her sandwich, realizes that it looks kinda like mayonnaise. She takes it back to the counter where they insist that there was no mayo on the sandwich. Eventually, it turns out that the piece of chicken contained a tumor, and when the woman bit into it it exploded, releasing some kind of pus-like substance. This tale was spread in many variant forms:       Unlike most contaminated food stories, this one couldn’t have happened as told. Fast food chicken sandwiches are made of chopped, processed meat: chicken is ground then reformed into breast-shaped patties. Even those sandwiches fabricated from whole chicken breast couldn’t possibly come through the preparation process with a pus-filled abscess intact, as the meat has to be pounded to spread it out to fit the bun, and to stop it from curving up in the middle the way an unmanipulated chicken breast would (which would make piling on the fixings that much harder). And then there’s frying process — no pus-filled anything is going to survive that. Not only is this a legend about what yucky things might be lurking in our fast food, it’s also a tale that dredges up the specter of cancer. (In the vast majority of tellings a tumor is discovered in the chicken sandwich, not an abscess or a cyst. This, by the way, also eliminates any remaining credibility the story might have, for tumors are hard masses of cancerous flesh without pus.)",1
"On 31 October 2017, the junk news site formerly known as Your News Wire, since rebranded as News Punch, published an article based entirely on an alleged quote from an anonymous “production staffer” accusing actor Kevin Spacey of having sexually abused musician Justin Bieber. Under the headline “Producer Claims Kevin Spacey “Drugged And Raped” Justin Bieber,” News Punch reported: “I’m not trying to play down what Harvey Weinstein is accused of doing,” the production staffer said, “But his victims were adults. Kevin has spent decades using his power and influence to fraternize with young, often underage boys. “Everyone in the industry knows about Kevin. Spacey’s crimes are some of the worst kept secrets in Hollywood. He preys on young usually ‘straight’ male child or teen stars early on in their career, and of course the ‘straight’ victims don’t say a word about it because they are ashamed. Spacey has been accused by numerous people of sexual misconduct, some describing incidents that happened to them when they were teenagers. He is facing felony assault and battery charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. However, YourNewsWire (and now News Punch) has a long track record of inventing sensational quotes and churning up false stories about celebrities or politicians, often quoting made-up “anonymous” sources. The site frequently plays on paranoia over “elite” pedophile rings drummed up by PizzaGate and Qanon conspiracy theories. No other reports to date have suggested that Bieber, who as a child achieved fame as a pop singer, is one of the people accusing Spacey of sexual assault, although some of the accusers have chosen to remain anonymous. And it is telling that the quotes from a supposed House of Cards “production staffer” included in the News Punch article never actually assert what the headline proclaims. Moreover, the quotes published by News Punch appear only on that website, and it’s highly unlikely a person would exclusively report a potential serious criminal act to a junk news site with a track record of fabricating sources. The News Punch article also linked to an earlier story of theirs which falsely claimed Just Bieber had stated that “Evil pedophiles run the music industry.”",1
"Gene therapy is designed to deliver a one-off cure for the patient and drugmakers are typically asking a hefty price that is comparable to the combined costs of alternative life-long treatment. Britain’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said in draft guidance published on Friday that Strimvelis gene therapy used against adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA-SCID, improves overall survival compared with standard stem cell transplant therapy. The inherited condition disables the immune system and without treatment, children with ADA-SCID need to be kept in isolation to avoid infections – hence it has become known as the  “bubble baby” or “bubble boy” syndrome. “Strimvelis represents an important development in the treatment of ADA-SCID, offering the potential to cure the immune aspects of the condition and avoid some of the disadvantages of current treatments,” NICE said. “Costing 594,000 euros, the treatment is usually given once only and the effects are thought to be life-long,” it added. The draft guidance marks the first time NICE has applied its new cost effectiveness limits for treatments for very rare conditions.",0
"A rumor started circulating during U.S. President Donald Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom in June 2019 that Queen Elizabeth II had “thrown shade” at the American leader by wearing a tiara that symbolically warded off evil and sickness:  The Burmese Ruby Tiara worn by the Queen on that occasion was commissioned in 1973 and included 96 rubies given to Elizabeth as a wedding present by the people of Burma. The House of Garrard, the jewelry company that made the tiara, recently posted an image of this bejeweled headpiece to their Instagram page and explained that the rubies were originally intended as a symbolic  protection against evil and illness: The Queen’s Burmese Ruby Tiara is one of the most symbolic and personal pieces created for Her Royal Highness by the House of Garrard. The 96 rubies mounted in the tiara were originally given to the queen as a wedding gift from the people of Burma, intended as a symbol of protection against illness and evil. #Garrard #royalfamily #heritage #ruby #queenelizabethii The Court Jeweler blog elaborated on that topic: The new ruby tiara was made by Garrard in 1973. The rubies used in the making of the new piece were also a wedding gift; Elizabeth received them from the people of Burma. The gift included precisely 96 rubies, all of which are now set in the tiara. The Burmese people believe that rubies help protect the wearer from the 96 diseases that can afflict the human body — they definitely wanted to ensure that Elizabeth remained hale and hearty. The rubies and diamonds were set in a series of rose motifs, and if you know your English history, you’ll recognize a heraldic rose that combines white and red petals as the Tudor rose. The House of Garrard also posted an image of Queen Elizabeth wearing this tiara during President Trump’s state visit in June 2019: HM Queen Elizabeth II wore a suite of ruby jewels by Garrard to the State Banquet hosted for the US President yesterday. The Burmese Ruby and Diamond Tiara crafted in 1973 was complemented by a magnificent ruby necklace and matching earrings. #Garrard #royalfamily #queenelizabeth #heritage #highjewellery #tiara A post shared by  House Of Garrard (@houseofgarrard) on Jun 4, 2019 at 4:30am PDT   If Her Majesty’s wearing the Burmese Ruby Tiara were a sign of disrespect, one would expect that headpiece to see infrequent use. However, Elizabeth has worn the tiara on numerous occasions since it was commissioned in 1973, including while meeting world leaders such as South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, India’s President Pratibha Patil, Slovenia’s President Danilo Turk, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and French President François Mitterrand. The queen has also worn the tiara during celebratory events such as her silver jubilee in 1977:  In addition, the queen wore this tiara for an official portrait in 1992. That photograph would subsequently be used on the face of the £10 and £20 banknotes from St. Helena:  Given that Queen Elizabeth has worn this tiara in the company of a variety of world leaders and for a number of different special occasions, those claiming that she chose to wear it in June 2019 specifically as a slight against President Trump appear to be revealing more about their own political beliefs than the queen’s.",1
"In a statement, it said the ban, as well as a law making doctors liable to criminal charges for abortions done with the woman’s consent, were both unconstitutional. “The law criminalizing a woman who undergoes abortion of her own will goes beyond the minimum needed to achieve the legislative purpose and limits the right of self-determination of the woman,” it said in its ruling. Seven of the nine justices ruled the law unconstitutional, and two dissented. It had survived a challenge in 2012 when the court split evenly, four to four, as one seat was vacant then. “I believe this ruling frees women from shackles,” said Kim Su-jung, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, a doctor charged with conducting 69 illegal abortions. The ruling reflects a trend towards decriminalizing abortion, as cases of criminal punishment have fallen in recent years. Just eight new cases of illegal abortion were prosecuted in 2017, down from 24 in 2016, judicial data show. Of 14 cases  decided in lower courts in 2017, 10 postponed a ruling on condition that no crime be committed for a fixed time. A survey by polling firm Realmeter last week showed more than 58 percent of South Korean respondents favor scrapping the ban, but a little over 30 percent wanted it retained. Dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse highlighted persistent divisions in opinion. “How could you kill a baby that’s growing inside you? Abortion is a murder,” said Kim Yeong-ju, a 47-year-old mother of two who demonstrated in favor of the ban. But the ruling helps ensure pregnancy is a personal choice, said Lee Ga-hyun, who joined a protest against the law after she saw a friend risk her life using illegal medication for an abortion. “I welcome today’s ruling, which made it possible for women like me and my friend to live their lives freely,” added Lee, 27. The abortion ban dates from 1953, and has not changed materially since South Korea first adopted its criminal law after the 1950-1953 Korean War. Abortion numbers have been dropping, with 49,764 estimated for women between 15 and 44 in 2017, down from 342,433 in 2005 and 168,738 in 2010, as birth control measures spread and the population of women in that age range falls, says the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. A 2017 petition urging the presidential Blue House to scrap the law against abortion and allow abortion medication drew more than 230,000 signatures. At the time, a senior government official said existing law was problematic because it only held women accountable for abortion. President Moon Jae-in, a liberal, has not stated clearly if he supports the law, but has called for more discussions to build consensus. The law prescribes jail for up to a year or fines of up to 2 million won ($1,756) for women who undergo abortion. It also sets terms of up to two years in jail and seven-year license suspensions for medical professionals, including doctors, who provide abortions at the woman’s request. Exemptions now allow abortions within 24 weeks of pregnancy for medical reasons, such as a hereditary disease or grave danger to the mother, or following rape. In all those cases, the law requires the spouse’s permission. “If the case does not fall under an exemption, the law forces the pregnant woman to maintain the pregnancy completely and uniformly, without exception,” the court said. But the law will stay on the books until the end of 2020, it added, to allow time for its revision. In a statement, the government said it would respect the decision and take steps to comply.

"The only cost information is the size of the research project. The story says, “Britain’s leading heart charity launched a 50 million pound ($80 million) research project on Tuesday into the potential of stem cells to regenerate heart tissue and “mend broken hearts”. The story later says, “At a briefing in London to launch a “mending broken hearts” fundraising campaign, scientists said research into stem cells and developmental biology may in future make this possible in people too.” It’s unclear whether they hope to raise $80 million or already have and are hoping to raise more, but what is clear is that there is not a single mention of how much this type of therapy might cost patients and insurers. Any story about an experimental procedure could at least mention that, while costs cannot yet be determined, such approaches will predictably be very expensive when/if they are in clinical use. What’s troubling about not even raising the issue is that stem cell therapy could easily become a treatment only available to those with money. Given that this story is primarily about a fundraising effort, we also think the story should have spent a bit of time explaining the administrative costs of fund raising. The BHF notes a 19% cost for fundrasing, a number comparable to the American Red Cross. There are no benefits quantified. This might be difficult given that there are no human studies for cardiac cell regeneration, but, at a minimum, the story should have quantified some of the benefits (and harms) that occurred in the mice studied or even in the cells. What happened to that tissue? And how many times did the researchers have to try before it worked? We might have given the story a pass on this criterion were it not for the overly optimistic tone and the series of summaries from lab research that are presented without the proper context. There is no attempt to even mention any potential harms of a stem cell approach. Any story that fails to challenge claims that mending hearts could be as simple as recovering from a broken leg – and that the approach might eliminate the need for heart transplants – certainly should at least nod in the direction of potential harms. Or an acknowledgement that it may take a long time to learn what the potential harms may be. The story’s first example for why regenerative cell therapy will work is the often cited zebrafish. “The ability of heart tissue to regenerate already occurs in some animals, such as zebrafish, which can regrow portions of their own hearts if they are damaged.” From there, we are given a menagerie of cellular and animal success stories, never with any discussion of the size of the study, the study design or the many steps in between these studies and human studies. The story says, “Scientists in the United States reported last year that they had been able to turn structural heart cells into beating cells by identifying genes that, in a developing embryo, turn an immature cell into a beating heart cell or cardiomyocyte.” This was done in a lab, not in humans. The same goes for the “thymosin beta 4” study that is referenced. It was done using mice tissue. The disconnected series of “facts” do not provide any context for the average reader and their relationship to the BHF effot remains uncler. Not applicable. The story provided no meaningful background on heart failure, so it can be neither satisfactory nor unsatisfactory on this criterion. The story does not quote a single independent expert. It provides quotes from Dr. Weissberg, the BHF medical director and Dr. Schneider, who runs a BHF research center. Dr. Riley, is noted as leading one of the British research teams. What is not noted is that Dr. Riley has conducted research in cooperation with RegeneRX, a company seeking to commercialize regenerative treatments. (see: http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100802/Thymosin-beta-4-is-essential-to-healthy-heart-development-embryonic-survival-Research.aspx ). The marketing materials actually provide more information about alternatives to regenerative therapy than the story. The British Heart Foundation’s website says, “We can encourage lifestyle changes to reduce risks of getting heart disease, and use surgery and drugs to minimise the effects of it, but the human heart cannot heal itself. At the moment, once your heart ‘breaks’, it stays that way. Although the story does not suggest that the treatments noted are available, it does provide the reader with a rather optimistic view of the possibility of such in the near term: “Scientists leading the work for the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said they hope that within the next decade they may have experimental drugs in development that would give certain kinds of cells in the heart the ability to regenerate tissue, repair damage and therefore combat heart failure.” Nearly a decade ago, in 2003, a story in the Chronicle of Philanthropy used the same animal – the zebrafish – to predict a therapy allowing humans to regenerate cells: “After all, our livers regenerate to the correct size, and his zebrafish rebuilt the right amount of heart tissue. Once you get cells started along the correct path, he hopes, the genetic instructions will take over, and a broken heart might just fix itself.” Nowhere does the story make it plain that none of the research being discussed has used human subjects and most of it hasn’t even been done in live animal subjects. There are many clinical trials and regulatory hurdles to overcome before a therapy like this would be on the market. The British Heart Foundation is slightly more realistic than this story, saying on its website, “Within five years we hope to begin early clinical trials. Within 10 years we aim to be running full trials. Within a further decade, people living with heart failure could look forward to a brighter future.” The story does a good job capturing the enthusiasm surrounding this field of study. Were a therapy to be developed that allowed people to regenerate their own heart tissue, this truly would be novel. The story, however, does not make it clear that regenerative medicine is a very broad field with a stack of literature a mile high, none of which has come close to doing anything as earth-shaking as regrowing a human organ in a patient. The suggestion that heart cells could theoretically be reprogrammed is not new, with the first publication now almost a decade ago. (see: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa012081 ) Although there is a much better understanding of the underlying biology, a treatment option is still not a foregone conclusion. None of this is clear from the story, and so the question of novelty is left unanswered. We don’t have any direct evidence that the story relied on a written news release, but it clearly relied heavily on a “briefing in London to launch a ‘mending broken hearts’ fundraising campaign”. There are no outside perspectives offered. This is essentially the same thing as relying on a news release.",1
"""The article fails to report how much the test costs. The article implies that people with """"low"""" LDL particles are linked to a 27 percent reduced risk of heart attacks. But the sentence is so unspecific and garbled it’s hard to know what the claimed benefit is. And the story only gives this relative risk reduction figure, not the more helpful context of the absolute risk reduction. The story does not mention the frequency of the test’s false positives or false negatives, both of which could have serious consequences for the patient. The article refers to an article """"recently"""" published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology. It does not name the article or specify the date. It appears the study is a paper published in October 2007 based on data collected for the Framingham Offspring Study. This is an observational study, not a clinical trial. The article implies that people who are ignorant about their LDL particle numbers cannot know their true heart disease risk. This can make people needlessly fearful that they need to have this test. The article quotes only one source, William Cromwell, the former chief medical officer of LipoSource, which markets the LipoProfile test. While the story says that Cromwell no longer has financial interest in the company, his co-author on the published study is an executive with LipoSource. This calls into question the reporter’s assertion that Cromwell """"no longer has a relationship with"""" his former employer. Under the circumstances, the lack of a clearly independent source is a serious failing. The story does not describe how heart disease risk can be assessed and managed by means other than using the LipoSource test. The article fails to report how and under what conditions the LipoProfile test is available. The article implies the LipoProfile test is a novel method of identifying otherwise hidden heart disease risk using lipid analysis. In fact, there are several tests available and under development that seek to link heart disease risk with a variety of lipid measures other than LDL and HDL numbers. The company’s most recent press release was issued on March 28. It’s not clear whether it triggered this story. No other media have written about the test or the company recently.""",1
"A bottlenose dolphin breaks the surface near Kennedy Space Center in this 2009 photo released by the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife March 3, 2011. REUTERS/USFW/Handout The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared “an unusual mortality event” last week when the number of dead dolphins washing up in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida had reached nearly 60, about half of them newly born or stillborn calves. The death toll along shoreline has climbed to at least 82 since then, many times the normal mortality rate for dolphins along the Gulf Coast this time of year. Although none so far showed outward signs of oil contamination, suspicions immediately turned to petrochemicals that fouled Gulf waters after a BP drilling platform exploded in April 2010, rupturing a wellhead on the sea floor. Eleven workers were killed in the blast, and an estimated 5 million barrels (206 million gallons) of crude oil spewed into the Gulf over more than three months. Scientists in the Gulf already were in the midst of investigating last year’s discovery of nearly 90 dead dolphins, most of them adults, when officials became alarmed at a surge in dead baby dolphins turning up on beaches in January. The latest spike in deaths, and a high concentration of premature infants among them, has led some experts to speculate that oil ingested or inhaled by dolphins at the time of the spill has taken a belated toll on the marine mammals, possibly leading to dolphin miscarriages. The die-off has come at the start of the first dolphin calving season in the northern Gulf since the BP blowout. But scientists at the independent Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama suggested Thursday that unusually chilly water temperatures in the Gulf may be a key factor. “Everyone wants to blame toxicity due to the oil spill, said Monty Graham, a senior scientist at the Dauphin Island lab. “The oil spill ... very well could have been the cause of the dolphin deaths. But the cold weather could have been the last straw for these animals.”   He noted that water temperatures abruptly plunged from the upper 50s into the 40s off Dauphin Island in January, just before the first two stillborn calves found there were recovered. He said a second wave of dolphin carcasses washed ashore after temperatures dipped again. Fellow Dauphin Island scientist Ruth Carmichael called the arrival of the cold snap “incredibly compelling.”   “The timing of the cold water may have been important because the dolphins were late in their pregnancies, about one to two months from giving birth. That might render them more vulnerable to temperature shocks,” she said. But NOAA officials discounted the significance of chilly weather, saying a similar cold snap in February 2010, months before the oil spill, was accompanied by higher-than-normal mortality among a range of wildlife, including fish and sea turtles. They also cited research showing bottlenose dolphins tend to swim away from extremely cool waters. “These animals have the ability to move away from cold. They don’t stay around in cold water,” said Moby Solangi, director of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi. Scientists on both sides of the argument agreed that if frigid weather were to blame, the end of the die-off is likely at hand as warmer temperatures return. But NOAA experts are bracing for the number of deaths to jump further as the bottlenose calving season reaches full swing in the coming weeks, said Blair Mase, a marine mammal scientist for the agency. Some 2,000 to 5,000 dolphins in the region typically bear their young this time of year.",0
"""America gets a lot of wildfires. Some of them hit grassy rangelands, some hit forests, most are small but some are huge. The 2011 Wallow forest fire in Arizona destroyed over half a million acres. Since 2000, the country has averaged nearly 75,000 fires a year with over 80 million acres lost. There are many causes but Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, focused on just one. Last week on Fox News’ The Five, the conversation turned to climate change and in the middle of making the case that economic growth had to be part of any solution, Perino made a passing reference to fires. """"A lot of the problems with forest fires, the major raging ones that happen in the West,"""" Perino said, """"Is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists and not clear out the forests."""" We tried to reach Perino to ask her what she meant by """"a lot"""" and what policies she had in mind. We did not hear from her. In this fact-check, we dig into the rich debate over the role of environmentalists and wildfires. In particular, we aim to see if fire damage would have been substantially less if environmental  policies were different. This question is as vast as the nearly 200 million acres managed by U.S. Forest Service, but we found that extensive drought and vast amounts of combustible material played a key role. And what about governments failing to proactively clear out forests? The consensus suggests a mix of factors that include fire policies dating back to the early 1900s and limited budgets to reduce fire hazards. What’s less clear is the role of environmental activists and environmental policies. It is true that environmental regulations and legal challenges by environmental activists frequently delay the work of the Forest Service. It is difficult to say if these delays played a major role in the large fires the country has experienced. Let’s take a look at the big picture, starting with the role of environmentalists. The environmental factor To John Barnwell, director of policy for the Society of American Foresters, a professional education group, the lack of money to prevent fires is primary. But environmentalists and their actions play a role. Barnwell chafes at the long environmental review process and frequent litigation over Environmental Impact Statements that beset the Forest Service. A 2010 analysis from Western Michigan University found that no other agency tops the Forest Service for the number of suits under the National Environmental Policy Act. It averaged about 100 legal challenges each year. In some well-known cases (think of the Spotted Owl in the Pacific Northwest), logging ground to a halt entirely due to environmental protection rules under the Endangered Species Act. Timber harvests on federal land are a fraction of what they were in late 1970s. Ann Camp, a forestry scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says national environmental groups seem to be intractable to compromise. """"I can tell you from experience that local environmentalists and local chapters of national environmental organizations have been on board for some activities,"""" Camp said. """"But the national chapters nixed their involvement and had already decided to contest the outcome -- whatever it was if it included any level of harvesting."""" We found the case of a New Mexico fire where a Forest Service thinning project that might have reduced the damage was delayed by appeals from two environmental groups. On the other hand, we also found examples where environmental groups worked hand in hand with loggers and state and national officials to move many projects forward. And Camp noted that some large fires took place in remote areas where no logging of any sort had ever been planned. Plus, fires have struck in forests where extensive harvests took place. There is no question that environmental rules and lawsuits delay and sometimes block activities on federal lands, but it is difficult to prove that absent those moves that the western states would have avoided their mega fires. And there are several other factors that play a more prominent role, experts say. The paradox of too little fire When Congress wants an impartial analysis, it turns to its in-house think tank, the Congressional Research Service. In 2012, the CRS looked at the causes of wildfire damage. That report said the roots of recent mega fires are """"excess biomass in the forests, due to past logging and grazing and a century of fire suppression, combined with an expanding wildland-urban interface — more people and houses in and near the forests — and climate change, exacerbating drought and insect and disease problems."""" A huge part of the reason we see huge fires today, the CRS report and experts say, is that we were too quick to put out fires. Around 1910 a series of massive fires wiped out entire towns. In two days, Washington, Montana, and Idaho lost 3 million acres of woodland. The fires led to a cry for the federal government to beef up its efforts to put fires out as quickly as possible. """"Our forestry tradition comes from central Europe, which has always had a paradigm that fire was bad for forests,"""" Camp said. Historically, periodic fires cleared out the undergrowth while allowing mature, healthy trees to survive. But with the focus on keeping fires small (the mantra was to put out every fire by 10 a.m. the day after it was reported), the amount of combustible material grew. The growth of grazing livestock also reduced naturally occurring fires by creating gaps in the terrain that stopped a fire from spreading. The result: In the 1800s, a natural stand of Ponderosa Pine, a common species in the West, might have a few dozen trees per acre. Today, hundreds of smaller trees might be squeezed into the same area. When fire hits, it burns hotter and moves faster. Instead of running along the ground, it jumps into the crown of the trees where the winds drive it even more. Many millions of acres of forest face this risk. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Forest Service policy began to shift in earnest toward viewing fire as a potential ally in managing the forests. But today, the Forest Service describes this legacy as the equivalent of a toxic dump. A hazard that built up over decades remains in place and is potentially lethal. Too little water The new millennium opened with an extended drought that left much of the western United States primed for fire. Peter Brown, a researcher at Colorado State University, has studied the fingerprints of fires over the centuries in the growth rings of trees. """"Fire is driven by climate,"""" Brown said. """"The first thing you need, besides something like a lightning strike for ignition, is dry conditions."""" The years from 2000 to 2004 were spectacularly dry. Colorado State researchers said the drought was the strongest in 800 years. It killed trees, made the ones that lived more vulnerable to insects and turned the ground cover into tinder. The 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona came after a winter with little precipitation. The combination of dry ground, dry wood and grasses and strong winds produced a fire that in five weeks burned as many acres as had burned in the previous 25 years. Too little money, too much land The federal government has tried to come to terms with the legacy of a management policy that left too much fuel in the forests. Just as the nation was entering one its worst periods of fire, the Forest Service laid out an ambitious plan to clear away that excess scrub, brush and small trees. Called the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, it aimed to use controlled burns and physical removal to treat 6.9 million acres per year. An assessment by Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute highlighted the gap between that goal and the reality. In 2011, the agency planned to reduce the risk of fire in an additional 960,000 acres. """"Th­e number of acres treated in Fiscal Year 2011 is not even close to number of acres proposed per year in the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, or that are needed to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire at the landscape scale,"""" the assessment said. At the heart of this problem is money. Barnwell said the Forest Service has been so busy fighting fires, it has needed to use the money that had been budgeted to prevent them. """"Over the past 10 years, they borrowed $3.4 billion from other activities to pay for fire suppression,"""" Barnwell said. """"Congress will put some of that back, but they’ve missed a season to do really important work. They can never get ahead."""" We found wide agreement that these fire prevention projects need to take place on a very large scale if they are to tamp down on the mega fires. The Congressional Research Service advised that the odds make it unlikely that the land you clear will be the one where a fire will take hold -- there are just too many acres to cover. By the CRS’ count, the odds that any given acre will catch fire are no more than 1 out of 100. Thus, you have to treat a lot of acres and that has not happened. Lastly, Perino broadly faulted policies """"put in place by environmentalists."""" But both the National Environmental Policy Act (1969) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) passed either unanimously or with overwhelming bipartisan support. President Ronald Reagan signed significant revisions into law. Perino’s characterization seems like an oversimplification. Our ruling Perino said, """"A lot of the problems with forest fires is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists."""" The crux of this fact-check really comes down to how you define """"a lot."""" While the record shows that the need for environmental impact statements and legal challenges have a significant impact on Forest Service projects on federal lands, the connection to the extreme fires of the past 15 years is less certain. Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame. Perino’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Update: The Forest Service drew funds from other programs over a 10-year period to pay for fire suppression. A previous version of this fact-check was unclear on this point..""",1
"""Costs of the new approach or the currently available components, continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps, are not described. The two components are not cheap and many insurance companies aren’t covering them except in special circumstances. We do receive one set of data on benefits, the 70% vs. 47% for time spent in target blood glucose. We’re unable to verify these numbers, as the abstract available online and MedPageToday coverage both cite """"Time in Target"""" as 72% and 50%. Perhaps 70% and 47% come from a different source, such as the press teleconference or presentation. We cannot verify it. Regardless, as we said for the harms, the comparative benefits are not meaningful if we don’t know who the comparator group was. Furthermore, we feel than an independent voice should’ve been provided to tell us the meaning of the benefits. According to the abstract, the key benefits were a) reduced variability and b) reduced time duration and severity of hyperglycemia. What does that mean for patients, or even doctors? Why does glucose deviation matter if, as the abstract says, the average glucose levels were the same in both groups? Just giving us """"70%"""" next to a lower number, without an explanation or an identity for the comparator group, says zilch about the value of this research. The investigator is quoted as saying that """"We reduced hypoglycemia by half."""" There’s a dissonant choir of problems with this statement. First, it’s not clear from the sentence’s placement in the article if this result came in the prior study with children or in the current study with adults. (The rest of these points assume the latter.) Second, the article doesn’t identify the comparator group (those who just used the insulin pump), so a relative result is meaningless. So when the claim is made, """"We reduced hypoglycemia by half,"""" readers should be told """"half of what?"""" Third, the fact that they used a relative risk reduction figure, not an absolute one, is important because this study was so short and small, using relative risk reductions masks the weight (or thinness) of the evidence, especially when we don’t have the statistical significance. Fourth, we’re not sure what data the investigator’s statement of reducing """"hypoglycemia by half"""" is based on. In the abstract, it’s says that the time spent below target glucose was approximately half but the difference was not statistically significant, no doubt due to the small power and short duration of the study. If our interpretation is correct, the story’s author has touted a benefit that’s insignificant, statistically speaking. Fifth, it should’ve been clearer about what """"reduced hypoglycemia"""" mean? The total time spent below target glucose range — which averaged out over the course of the study — is different than a (severe) hypoglycemic event, which some readers may read in this result. How dangerous is it to spend any time below the target range, if only temporary and possibly briefly? In other words, is it a harm or an efficacy issue? In the abstract, we read about 1 serious case of hypoglycemia  with the insulin pump, 0 with the closed-loop system; but again, with 12 patients using each for a night, statistically we’re not sure what that tells us. Regardless of the true intent of this statement, and the true harms that occurred in the study, an independent analysis may have clarified such confusions. No overt disease mongering. No sources appear to have been quoted besides those on the teleconference. We don’t know the basis for the call, but it sounds like a press briefing. Conflicts are mentioned for the people directly involved in the research. But readers can’t know or judge for themselves whether others who were quoted in the story were truly independent sources – with no funding connection to this research. The artificial pancreas approach isn’t compared to any other alternatives, if only because the article never identifies the comparator group as those using the insulin pump. One the one hand, the article tells us that the technology is emerging, the algorithm is still being developed, and the whole approach is still being researched in future studies. On the other hand, the article’s tone and unbalanced quotes from investigators make the ultimate availability seem like a foregone conclusion, which it isn’t after a 12-subject study. What’s missing is at least some emphasis, ideally early, that this research is quite experimental at this point, with some discussion of the steps between this small study and the technology potentially going to market. The article also takes until the third to last paragraph, after the discussion of the Ritholz study, to explain what an """"artificial pancreas"""" actually is; burying that explanation and leading with an illustration of a real human pancreas does nothing but suggest to lay readers that an """"artificial pancreas"""" is something like a prosthetic organ, instead of a computer link between extant devices. It could’ve been clearer about how the """"closed loop"""" technology is supposed to improve on the available devices. In fact, we’re not sure that the description of the artificial pancreas as a single discrete """"device"""" matches what was used in the study, which, according to the abstract, seems to have involved a glucose monitor, a computer, and a human being making adjustments to the patient’s insulin pump. The end of the article explains the artificial pancreas technology, implying that the computer linkage between monitor and pump is the novel part that is still under development. However, we give this criterion an Unsatisfactory rating because a) that explanation was buried in the end, after the Ritholz study summary; b) the article never explained that the aforementioned approach is the goal, not the one used in this study, which seems to have involved manual operators adjusting the patient’s insulin pump as they slept. Little information about how the """"artificial pancreas"""" actually works, and what it consists of physically — e.g., how big is the """"device""""? — is provided. This story does not appear to rely overly on the ADA press release. However, we see no evidence of any sources used outside the cited teleconference, which seems like a press briefing. Because of our uncertainty about how much independently vetted reporting took place, we’ll rate this not applicable.""",1
"""GOP Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Obamacare won’t help you grow old. """"It’s a law that cuts seniors’ Medicare,"""" Gillespie said in a campaign email listing reasons why  he opposes the health care law. This is a well-traveled claim that PolitiFact has met frequently over the years. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, backed up the statement, in part, with blurbs from fact checks written by our colleagues in two other PolitiFact bureaus. He pointed to a 2013 PolitiFact National article examining a claim by Scott Brown -- the Republican U.S. Senate nominee in New Hampshire -- that Obamacare """"raises taxes and cuts Medicare."""", saying the law """"definitely raises taxes,"""" to help pay for its costs. But our colleagues also said the claim that Obamacare cuts Medicare is a complicated issue that undercut the accuracy of Brown’s full claim. PolitiFact has looked askance at bare statements that Obamacare cuts Medicare, rating them either Half True or  depending on how they are worded. Obamacare, to help cover its costs, also imposed a series of savings. Among them are measures that will reduce the increase in Medicare by $716 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate. It’s important to note that Medicare spending will continue to rise, but at a slower pace than they it would have without the law. And the savings are focused on lowering payments to hospitals and insurance companies -- not beneficiaries. Gillespie’s says that Obamacare cuts """"seniors’ Medicare."""" That suggests the law isn’t just reducing Medicare spending but is actually slicing Medicare benefits. To support that line of reasoning, Logan pointed to a couple of PolitiFact articles in which experts suggested that the reduced payments the law calls for could affect patients’ access to services. PolitiFact Wisconsin noted in October 2012 concerns that slowing growth in Medicare payments might discourage some health care providers from accepting Medicare patients. One area of concern is the Medicare Advantage program, which is run by private insurers and offers greater benefits than traditional Medicare for things such as dental care, free eye glasses and gym memberships. About 30 percent of the 54 million Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. are enrolled in those plans, according to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. Those privately run plans cost more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare, and Obamacare  seeks to even out those costs. Some health care analysts have said the law’s Medicare Advantage cost savings might lead to its enrollees’ paying higher premiums or losing some of their extra benefits On the other hand, Gillespie does not mention that the health care law actually adds some new services: It gradually closes that gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the """"doughnut hole,"""" funds illness prevention benefits and expands preventative care benefits. Logan also referred us to statements issued by for former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va. In March 2010, Webb said said Obamacare would make """"dramatic cuts in Medicare"""" and lamented the reductions in Medicare Advantage. Here’s a quick note on the timing of Gillespie’s email. Logan told us it was originally sent in January and was resent by the campaign on Aug. 25 after the Daily Press in Newport News -- which published a weekly PolitiFact Virginia digest --signed up recently to get automated email updates from the campaign. """"Unless you want to single out that particular signup, it would be more accurate to refer to it as a January email rather than an Aug. 25 email,"""" Logan said. Because the email is part of the campaign’s ongoing communications about Obamacare -- one that the Gillespie campaign feels free to resend -- we think it’s fair to judge it as a current line of attack from Gillespie’s campaign on the law. Our ruling Gillespie says Obamacare """"cuts seniors’ Medicare,"""" a statement that implies the law is reducing benefits across the board. There’s debate among analysts over how the law’s cost savings measures will impact some beneficiaries, particularly seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers. Some of those seniors -- who comprise about 30 percent of Medicare recipients -- may lose some of the extra benefits they had before the law or could see higher premiums. Overall, the health care law slows Medicare’s growth, but spending will still rise significantly and some new services for seniors were added.""",1
"As strong winds sent flames roaring into Paradise at 2 miles per minute, emergency personnel and locals realized their escape plans, crafted after a 2008 blaze, would not work. “The lessons we had learned in the past kind of went out of the window due to the sheer speed and intensity of this fire,” Paradise Emergency Operations Coordinator Jim Broshears said in a phone interview. The small mountain town was facing the so-called Camp Fire, one of a series of recent “megafires” fueled by drought, erratic winds and overgrown forests that quickly torch over 100,000 acres. A week after California’s deadliest blaze, which killed at least 71 people, residents were critical of the town’s alert system. Broshears said other towns could save lives if they taught residents to shelter from fire and got more of them to sign up for alerts. As Paradise was engulfed around 8 a.m. on Nov. 8, officials attempted a staggered evacuation using their CodeRED alert system to target a zone at a time. They wanted to avoid the panic and chaos that ensued in 2008 as all 27,000 residents tried to flee at once. With the fire toppling power lines and mobile towers, and residents jamming networks with calls, about 60 percent of CodeRED alerts were delivered, according to Troy Harper a spokesman for OnSolve, the company that provides the service. Between 25 and 50 percent of residents had signed up for the optional system, Broshears said, meaning 30 percent of households, at best, got alerts. As the town burned, officials abandoned the phased evacuation and told everyone to get out, Broshears said. “We felt we morally couldn’t do that and just had to go all out and hope for the best,” said the former Paradise fire chief, who has lived in the town since 1974. Locals like nurse Darrel Wilken said an old-fashioned siren system would have been better than CodeRED. “People who are not connected to the internet or phone need to know there is a fire,” said Wilken. Paradise widened, paved and straightened roads after the 2008 blaze to allow for a speedier evacuation. But the Camp Fire burned across all escape routes. “The flow plan didn’t work,” said Broshears. “We couldn’t flow huge amounts of traffic down an available highway because there was no available highway.”  The fire moved faster than anyone expected, throwing embers that reached 2 miles (3 km) ahead of the flames, Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said. “I don’t know that there’s a city or town in the entire world that could evacuate their entire population all at the same time and not overwhelm their roadway structure,” Jones told CNN in an interview on Saturday. On the ground, residents fought to escape the town. Wilken, 51, got word around 8 a.m. that the fire was 7 miles away. By 8:15 a.m. trees outside his window at the Feather River Hospital were on fire. There was no time to gather ambulances to evacuate the 67 admitted patients as staff had trained to do. “If your car was not on fire, you were the ambulance,” said Wilken, who loaded three patients into his Subaru WRX. His designated escape route was blocked by flames. He wove through back streets and a slalom of burning vehicles, his car exterior melting from the heat, trees and electricity poles falling on vehicles ahead, before reaching safety hours later. As Wilken fled, firefighters and volunteers including resident Mike Boggs tried to get into town. Police had turned all exit routes into contraflows, a move that sped up the evacuation, but obstructed first responders trying to enter Paradise. Boggs went off road and drove up a ditch in his pickup, followed by a fire truck. The 60-year-old iron worker credits a decision after the 2008 blaze with saving his and nearby homes in Butte Valley, near Paradise. He bought 40 cattle that grazed on grass that would have otherwise fed the fire. “Everywhere I put my cows it didn’t burn,” said Boggs. For Broshears, one of the biggest lesson from the Camp Fire was that residents facing a megafire might sometimes be better off sheltering in open spaces, like road intersections, than trying to outrun flames. “It would be ugly but you’d survive,” he said.",0
"The news release does not mention costs. The news release encapsulates the differences observed: “The study examined 121 patients at an average of 51 months post-surgery,” it says. “Of this group, 68 patients had experienced their first dislocation, while 53 had recurrent dislocations after being initially treated non-operatively. After treatment with an arthroscopic bankart repair, the postoperative dislocation rate in the first-time injury group was 29%, compared to 62% in those who did not have surgery after their initial injury.” And 7% of those with surgery after the initial dislocation vs 32% after a recurrent dislocation had to have another surgery, according to the release. The news release does not say whether there were any drawbacks associated with undergoing surgery. This quote from the lead author appears to acknowledge their existence: “While young athletes and parents may be wary of surgery, our study shows the advantages of this treatment approach,” commented Marshall. But it does not spell out what those drawbacks might be. The study was based on a retrospective chart review to identify subjects. More than half of identified subjects (296 of 439) were then excluded for various reasons for the next phase of the study, which was a survey, with an 85 percent response rate reported. The study was not a randomized trial, which would have made the results more clear, and which would have allowed a more definitive statement about management of the problem. The release would have been stronger had it pointed out the limitations of retrospective studies and surveys. The news release doesn’t engage in disease mongering. Nor does it say how many people are affected by shoulder instability or even what “shoulder instability” is, how it’s caused, or what its impact is. Any or all of these would have provided useful context. It would have been helpful had the news release noted that Alabama Orthopedic Spine & Sports Medicine Associates carried out the surgeries. The news release refers to “non-operative” interventions, but does not say what they are. The news release does not say how available either procedure is. The release would have been stronger if it had clarified whether all orthopedic surgeons perform this procedure or if it is a specialized procedure only available at certain clinics. The news release does not say anything about the novelty of the surgical intervention or of the non-surgical approaches. Is this the first time this issue has been studied? The release gives no sense as to how this study fits into the wider body of research. The release doesn’t rely on sensational language or make overtly unjustified claims. However, as noted above under the summary and evidence headings, we have some concerns about the way the study findings were presented in the release. The news release says that the research “demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.” But the study abstract itself does not justify going that far. Instead, it says simply that “first time dislocators had lower postoperative instability rates and reoperation rates when compared to patients with recurrent dislocations prior to surgical intervention.” Association v. Causation 101. And a quote from the lead author offers a curious view of the role of the physician: “Deciding between a non-operative program or going forward with surgery can be a challenging decision for medical professionals treating shoulder injuries in young athletes,” says Dr. Marshall. That statement implies that treatment decisions are made by medical professionals alone. But the agenda paper offers a more inclusive take: “Young, athletic patients with shoulder instability should be offered early surgical intervention to lower the risk of postoperative instability and reoperation,” it says.",1
"This article does a great job of noting the cost and pricing issues inherent in the drug company’s efforts to develop, test and market novel biologicals. The headlong rush to “personalized” medicine, pharmacogenetic approaches to treatment, limited resources even in wealthy nations with gold-plated insurance policies, and the opacity of drug industry research costs make it imperative to explain to the public the realities of medicine’s pricing system. The thoughtful reader will understand that the benefits are modest, as indicated by the well-written headline and carefully worded opening sentence. However, missing from the story was a discussion of the study findings in absolute terms. The story says the study that “heart-attack survivors on one of three doses of canakinumab were 15 percent less likely to suffer another major cardiac event than those on a placebo.” What does this mean in absolute numbers? The way researchers measured it was in events per 100 person-years, and the “events” were non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, or death from a cardiovascular reason. In the placebo group, there were 4.50 cardiac events per 100 person-years. In the group receiving 150 mg doses of canakinumab, there were 3.86 events per 100 person years. Of the various doses given (50, 150 and 300 milligrams), the 150 mg dose was the only statistically significant result, and it was only because of non-fatal heart attacks. From the get-go, readers are told there are risks to keep in mind. This was entirely absent from the TIME story we reviewed. That said, we wish this Reuters story had discussed the harms more in-depth–how frequent were they? How severe? This was a randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial with a large number of patients. The story doesn’t explain this, nor any of the study’s limitations. No mongering here. This story, which is more of a “business of medicine” story, uses a drug industry analyst source to good effect, and included commentary from the study’s accompanying editorial. Both this story and the TIME story don’t mention that there are many effective and less expensive alternatives to secondary cardiac disease prevention, such as smoking cessation, aspirin, statins, blood pressure control, etc. The lede graph says “Novartis will seek regulatory approval” for the drug’s use against heart disease, “though some experts fear fatal infection risks and a high price may overshadow the medicine’s limited scientific benefits.” At least for now. The story does a pretty good job of explaining what is novel about the the drug’s effects and targeting. The story does not appear to rely on the news release.",0
"News stories abound of airline passengers traveling with all sorts of unusual animals under the premise that their non-human companions provide necessary emotional support, such as this one about a bereaved widow who flew with her turkey to San Francisco, where she would be spreading her late husband’s ashes: A Seattle woman who was flying to San Francisco to spread her husband’s ashes took her 25-pound pet turkey on the flight for emotional support. Jodie Smalley, 34, says her turkey, Easter, has been there for her since her husband passed away from cancer three months ago. She had a custom diaper made for Easter for their flight, and she has all the necessary documents that certify the turkey is a legitimate emotional support animal. “Hearing about a turkey on a plane sounds ridiculous,” she said. “But people have no idea what I’ve been through.” While service animals such as seeing-eye dogs have a long history and are familiar to nearly everyone, emotional support animals are a much newer phenomenon. Established law provides for the accommodation of service animals and emotional support animals in housing and other public facilities, but headlines start rolling off the presses when the human half of the pair attempts to travel on an airplane with a non-standard species such as a miniature horse, pig, or monkey. Pot-bellied pigs are often favored as emotional support animals by those who are allergic to dogs. However, pigs don’t always travel well, as illustrated in several news stories of recent years: in November 2014, for instance, a woman was escorted off of a USA Airways flight in Connecticut because her 70-pound pot-bellied pig was squealing uncontrollably, “three times louder than a child,” and defecated in the airplane aisle. In a 2001 incident (again on a USA Airways flight), the passenger informed the airline that her pig was “about a hundred pounds,” but staff were taken aback when the pig arrived and it proved to be closer to 300 pounds. The two women (the pig-owner was traveling with a friend) were assigned bulkhead seats in first class to provide as much space as possible, but they were still forced to plant their feet on the bulkhead for the duration of the six-hour flight to allow adequate space for their porcine companion. Although the pig was calm during the flight, it became frantic upon deplaning, squealing, urinating, and defecating in the close confines of the galley in a frenzied effort to get off the airplane after landing. In May 2003, blind passenger Dan Shaw traveled from Boston to Chicago with his seeing-eye miniature horse, Cuddles, to appear on an episode of Oprah Winfrey’s talk show. Shaw chose a miniature horse instead of a dog for his guide animal because horses have much longer lifespans than dogs, and he was afraid of getting emotionally attached to a dog who might have a relatively short life. Shaw purchased a first-class ticket for his horse because, at two feet high and 70 pounds in weight, Cuddles wouldn’t have fit under the seat in front of him in coach. Although American Airlines staff initially debated requiring that Cuddles wear a diaper, they relented when they were assured that Cuddles was housebroken and decided to forego the diaper requirement for the two-hour flight. That turned out to be an unfortunate decision, because Cuddles defecated on the carpet in front of the bulkhead. The fact that the flight’s take-off was delayed 45 minutes may have contributed to Cuddles’ discomfort. We didn’t find any instances of service monkeys being involved in disruptive incidents aboard airplanes, but perhaps that is because most service monkeys are six to ten pound Capuchins who can fit in a carrier under the seat in front of the passenger, just as more typical pets do. With incidents like these appearing in the news, and consumers experiencing the ever-closer confines of coach seating, air travel with unusual animals immediately grabs the public’s attention. In particular, air passengers have taken umbrage at other flyers who are seemingly trying to “game the system” and declare their household pets to be emotional support animals to get their animals on-board for free. In 1986, Congress passed the Air Carrier Access Act, a law intended (in part) to ensure that service animals would be allowed to fly on planes and could not be booted off simply because other passengers object to their presence. Service animals must be under the control of their owners (physically by a leash or cage, or verbally through commands), cannot roam around the cabin, and — contrary to the accidents described in the news stories mentioned above — must be trained not to eliminate on  airplanes. For flights of longer than eight hours, the owners must provide written plans for clean disposal of waste. Although the emergency exit rows with their expanded legroom might seem like a logical place to put a dog or other service animal, those rows must be kept clear at all times for emergencies, so service animals usually end up in the bulkhead rows if they are too large to fit under a seat. Monkeys are the only species permitted by the FAA to travel on a seat instead of the floor (although we’ve read of celebrities purchasing first-class seats for their pet pooches). Airlines, thankfully, are allowed to prohibit passage to unusual service animals such as snakes, rodents, ferrets, and spiders. They can also prohibit farm poultry, but Easter — the widow’s turkey mentioned at the beginning of this article — had been classified as a domesticated bird by Delta Airlines and was thus allowed to fly. (It should be noted that Easter flew without incident: he wore a diaper and reportedly “didn’t make a sound.”) There’s a legal distinction between service animals and emotional support animals. Service animals, usually dogs, are individually trained to assist their owners with disabilities. These include the well-known Seeing Eye Dogs, Hearing Dogs, Psychiatric Service Dogs, Seizure Response Dogs, and dogs who are trained to perform such tasks as pulling a wheelchair, picking up items that have been dropped, reminding a person to take medication, alerting their person to a sound, and so on. Service animals also occasionally include miniature horses such as Cuddles. Emotional Support Animals (ESA), also known as Comfort Animals, are supposed to be used as part of an emotional therapeutic treatment plan. They do not have specific training to provide tasks on behalf of their humans and are not considered service animals under the American Disabilities Act. They may provide companionship, relieve loneliness, and sometimes help with depression, anxiety, or other phobias. There is no national standardized certification to document the qualifications of an emotional support animal. Some pet owners have been accused of falsely claiming that their household pet is an emotional support animal to travel for free (since the Air Carrier Access Act prohibits the airlines from charging a fee for such animals) or to get around the limitations that airlines typically impose on the number of pets allowed to travel per cabin. Legally, getting an ESA on an airplane requires documentation from a mental health provider verifying the emotional benefit of the animal. The letter should be less than one year old, prescribe or endorse the animal as an ESA offering benefits for a particular mental disability, and the emotional/mental diagnosis must comply with the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). In practice, however, it is not difficult to find mental health providers who will provide supportive letters. In addition, numerous websites exist that promise to “certify” an owner’s pet as an emotional support animal, charging between $59 and $200 to provide the owner with an ID vest and a certificate — and sometimes the necessary mental health letters as well. While researching this story, we easily found websites that promised “Any dog may qualify,” “Take your pet everywhere. Instant Approval!”, and “It’s easy to register your pet as an emotional support animal!” Two Today investigative writers discovered first-hand the ease with which they could travel with their animals. Jeff Rossen filled out a questionnaire on a ESA web site and was sent an official letter from a mental health professional without ever seeing or speaking to her. He subsequently took two flights with his dog sitting in his lap, and no one from the airlines even asked to see the letter. His colleague, Lindsey Bomnin, received certification from the same web site for a borrowed pot-bellied pig, then took two flights with the pig on her lap. Although obtaining certification for a household pet may seem like a nifty way of avoiding the airlines’ pet fares — or sticking it to an industry which seems to find ever-more-numerous ways of nickel-and-diming their customers — faking a disability ultimately ends up hurting those who really do need their emotional support animals. In addition, claiming that a large and unruly animal is an ESA (like that 300-pound pig) presents a true safety hazard to passengers and crew alike if the animal panics or goes on a rampage.",0
"The statement gave no reason for their removal, but said forests would be managed under the office of the prime minister for the time being. Bongo had promised to punish anyone implicated in the disappearance of a cache of 392 containers of the wood, which were seized at the port of Owendo in late February and early March. Two Chinese nationals are being held in relation to the case, and last week the head of customs Dieudonne Lewamouo was detained. Gabonese authorities said last month that they had recovered 200 containers. Illegal logging is ravaging the forests of West and equatorial Africa, most of it driven by Chinese demand, but rarely do governments take action against suspected culprits. Since taking over from his father in 2009 - continuing a family dynasty that has exceeded five decades - Ali Ben Bongo has cast himself as an environmental crusader. He has delighted conservation groups by banning raw wood exports, expanding protected zones and creating 13 new national parks. Despite those efforts Gabon remains a hub for poaching, illegal logging and the illicit wildlife trade. Bongo suffered a stroke last October while abroad, but returned home in March. Secrecy surrounding the state of Bongo’s health during his five-month absence has fueled instability in Gabon, where declining oil revenues and widespread poverty have dented his popularity.",0
"The billion-dollar project “MenStar” will target men living with or at risk of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been ravaged by AIDS since the 1980s. “The MenStar coalition is bravely tackling the root cause of this problem — the lack of awareness of HIV prevention amongst hard-to-reach young men,” Harry said at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. Speaking at the launch, which also featured South African actress Charlize Theron and Ndaba Mandela, the grandson of late President Nelson Mandela, Elton John said: “If we want to end AIDS once and for all, we must make men part of the solution.”  Around 36.7 million people around the world have HIV, according to 2016 figures cited by the United Nations’ HIV/AIDS body UNAIDS. Fewer than half of men living with HIV receive treatment compared with 60 percent of women, it said. “It is time there was a global coalition to teach men to protect themselves. And in doing so, it will teach them to better protect not only their wives and girlfriends, their sisters and daughters, but also, critically, their brothers and their sons,” the British singer said. UNAIDS said this month that the fight against HIV/AIDS was “slipping off track” and while deaths were falling and treatment rates rising, rates of new HIV infections threatened to derail efforts to defeat the disease. Prince Harry said the campaign launch came at “a time when new energetic and innovative solutions are needed more than ever before”. “MenStar” is supported by the U.S. government’s PEPFAR program for tackling HIV/AIDS and by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Experts at the conference hope for the elimination of AIDS worldwide by 2030, but the United Nations warned last Wednesday of a funding gap of £4.6 billion that threatens efforts.",0
"Hanging, poisoning and shooting are the most common suicide methods, the WHO said as it urged governments to adopt suicide prevention plans to help people cope with stress and to reduce access to suicide means. “Suicide is a global public health issue. All ages, sexes and regions of the world are affected (and) each loss is one too many,” the WHO’s report said. Suicide was the second leading cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 29, after road injury, and among teenage girls aged 15 to 19 it was the second biggest killer after maternal conditions. In teenage boys, suicide ranked third behind road injury and interpersonal violence. Overall, close to 800,000 people die by suicide every year - more than are killed by malaria or breast cancer, or by war or homicide, the WHO said. Global rates have fallen in recent years - with a 9.8% decrease between 2010 and 2016 - but declines were patchy. In the WHO’s Americas region, for example, rates rose by 6% in between 2010 and 2016. The report also found that nearly three times as many men as women die by suicide in wealthy countries, in contrast to low- and middle-income countries, where the rates are more equal. “Suicides are preventable,” said the WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We call on all countries to incorporate proven suicide prevention strategies into national health and education programs.”  The WHO said restricting access to pesticides was one of the most effective ways of reducing suicide numbers swiftly. Pesticides are commonly used and usually result in death because they are so toxic, have no antidotes, and are often used in remote areas where there is no nearby medical help. The WHO pointed to studies in Sri Lanka, where bans on pesticides have led to a 70% drop in suicides and an estimated 93,000 lives saved between 1995 and 2015.",0
"The above-displayed photographs have been circulating on the Internet since at least 2004, usually in e-mail forwards that set them in one of several Arab/Muslim areas (e.g., Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Palestinian territories) and claim that the boy pictured is being punished under a harsh Sharia  law system that imposes a penalty grossly out of proportion to the nature of the crime (i.e., having his arm crushed under a vehicle because he stole a loaf of bread). These pictures originated with the Iranian news site PeykeIran, who (along with persons who have witnessed similar scenes in other countries) confirmed that what the photographs actually depict is performers hustling money from onlookers by staging a common street act, one in which a subject seemingly allows himself to be run over by a heavy vehicle and then emerges unscathed. This a common act, variations of which are performed by many magicians and accomplished through a variety of means, with no lasting harm done. That the subject is a small boy who grimaces his way through the stunt is all part of the act, intended to elicit sympathy and extra cash from onlookers. (Despite his contorted facial expressions, the boy is not seriously or permanently injured by the process.) It’s difficult to make any definitive statement about Sharia/Islamic law since customs and enforcement can vary from region to region, but although the cutting off  hands may sometimes be the prescribed maximum penalty for cases of theft under the strictest interpretations of Sharia, Islamic law resources consistently note that such punishments shall not be applied to children who have not yet reached puberty (which is defined as the age of 15 for boys), nor for the theft of small-value items or food by the hungry:    The maximum sentence of any violation of law is not applied in every case. In the robbery and theft cases for example, the maximum penalty of hand-cutting applies after the consideration of many factors such as track record and whether the theft was made for profit. In some cases, such as stealing food because of severe hunger or to prevent death, there may not be a penalty. A person’s hand is not amputated when he steals less than the equivalent of 4.374 grams of gold [or] something that is useless. The penalty for the one who steals (when the above conditions are met) is that his/her right arm is amputated. The above photographs do not depict any form of amputation, and it is the child’s left arm which goes under the wheels. Moreover, there are no police, judges, religious authorities, or other officials evident in any of the pictures, just a huckster with a hand-held microphone who drums up business and describes the action for the onlookers visible in the background of the first photo. (Also note the blanket placed under the boy’s arm: something that is useful for a staged stunt but is unlikely to be provided or allowed by those intent on severely punishing a lawbreaker.)

"""The story says that Lupron costs about $5,000 a month but is seldom covered by insurance. Good job to address both points. The story, as noted, cites the Maryland researcher’s claims from small published studies, but also states: """" numerous physicians, researchers and therapists insist there’s no proof mercury causes autism, that Lupron removes mercury or that autistic kids have excessive testosterone."""" The story did a good job dedicating quite a bit of discussion to potential harms from this approach – both known and unknown. The story explained that the Maryland physician promoting the theory """"published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior. He has since issued other studies finding that mercury leads to excess testosterone and that autistic children have excessive levels of the hormone."""" But then it immediately notes: """"Other doctors said (the) studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods."""" No disease mongering in this story. Several independent expert sources were quoted. Good job on this as well. The story states that """"untested autism treatments have flourished."""" And it ends with:    It’s clear from the story that Lupron is already used to treat endometrial cancer and prostate cancer. The story might have addressed more directly its current off-label use. It’s also clear that this is about a Maryland medical group taking its idea on the road to South Florida. Ideally, the story might have addressed whether it’s being tried elsewhere. No inordinate claims of novelty. In fact, the story establishes that the one Maryland researcher has been testing this for at least five years. This story did not rely on a news release. Strong enterprise reporting.""",0
"On 30 October 2017, climate change denier blog “Watts Up With That?” (which bills itself as “the world’s most viewed site on global warming and climate change”) published a guest essay by Leo Goldstein. This essay attempted to use a 1977 Time Magazine cover as evidence that Snopes and other news organizations had used a straw man argument in a previous debunker about Time Magazine and so-called Global Cooling. (Goldstein appears to be under the impression he invented the concept of a straw man argument, and instead calls such a device by his own term “Flooding Fake.” We will use the established nomenclature here). Despite the fact that this article did not once mention the concept of global cooling, and despite the fact that this article was about record-setting cold temperatures in the winter of 1977 and was explicitly filed under the subject “weather,” WUWT described the cover as “An example [of the] global cooling scare of the 70s.” The WUWT post went on to suggest, without evidence, that Time magazine itself wanted to hide the existence of this cover (which is freely available in their online archives) by manufacturing a fake cover for unsuspecting fact-checkers like ourselves to then debunk: That cover is a seriously inconvenient truth for climate alarmists and their media accessories. So, Time attempted to re-write a history. It published a forged version of its own cover. …and then easily debunked it as a photoshopped version of its April 2007 cover. As I will explain below, Time magazine knew it was launching a hoax. The rest of the liberal media popularized it, although it could have easily recognized it. Snopes adopted it, invented additional details that were not present in the Time article, and angrily condemned “climate deniers.” It is clear that Goldstein either willfully ignored the contents of the article, or (as other prolific climate deniers proudly brag about) did not read it in the first place. The article, in brief, discussed anomalously cold temperatures during the winter of 1977, and the effect that such temperatures had on a variety of elements of American life, most notably shortages of natural gas: Still, it is the brutal and unrelenting cold — the Big Freeze — that has transformed the inevitable grousing about the weather into personal agony and national hardship. It was like living in the Arctic—an ominous reminder of how modern man, so proud of his technological mastery of his environment, remains so vulnerable to its whims. Indeed, his very reliance on energy-consuming machines, vehicles and conveniences contributed last week to widespread suffering. To meet soaring energy demands for heating, electrical utilities ordered temporary blackouts in some communities and reduced voltage in others. A genuine crisis developed in the natural-gas industry. Suppliers put into effect emergency plans, cutting all deliveries to thousands of industrial users. Company officials pleaded for school closings, shortened business hours, and thermostats to be turned down to teeth-chattering levels in private homes. Weather, which is the short-term scale fluctuation of temperatures, precipitation and other environmental factors that might describe a singularly cold winter in 1977, is a wholly different concept than climate, which is concerned with long-term averages of weather phenomena, normally referring to time periods no shorter than 30 years. WUWT does reference media reports from the 1970s that, as we discussed in our fact-check of the other purported Time magazine global cooling cover, did indeed raise concerns about a cooling planet. However those reports did not represent in any way a consensus view from the scientific community, and the author of the most notable iteration of that story (published not in Time but in Newsweek), later admitted the article was high on enthusiasm but low on supporting science: Here I must admit mea culpa. In retrospect, I was over-enthusiastic in parts of my Newsweek article. Thus, I suggested a connection between the purported global cooling and increases in tornado activity that was unjustified by climate science. I also predicted a forthcoming impact of global cooling on the world’s food production that had scant research to back it.",1
"The story does include a hint from the senior author that the treatment would be “accessible,” and presumably the cost of flickering lights would be an issue for most people. Given that the research under consideration here involved mice — and genetically bred mice at that — there’s no way to determine whether the intervention would have any benefit at all to people, let alone to quantify the likely benefits for human. The story does acknowledge this. But in the process, it also overstates what is known about the causes of Alzheimer’s and therefore how relevant this approach is to treating it. The story states flatly that “toxic proteins” are the culprit, but this is the subject of much debate within the Alzheimer’s research community and increasing evidence points against it. This potential treatment is still in mouse trials, so there’s not a lot that can be said at this point about potential harms. The author quotes the researchers, who pointed out that the lights as they were used in the trial “would not be offensive at all for people to have in the background.” The story acknowledges in the third paragraph that the study involved only mice and notes that more research will be needed to determine whether this intervention has any relevance to people. It also acknowledges recent failed drug trials and notes that drugs typically take more than a decade to develop before clinical efficacy is even examined. We’ll award a Satisfactory grade on that basis, but we renew our concern that this is mice–and nothing here is relevant to the lay reader. We think that this is the kind of research that’s better left communicated amongst research audiences, not the general public. The study does not engage in disease mongering. It would be hard to overstate the tragedy of Alzheimer’s disease. We’re a little disappointed that the article closes by conflating dementia with Alzheimer’s, when it tells readers that dementia has passed heart disease as the second leading cause of death in Britain. The senior author of the study is cited (and her quote came from an unattributed news release, see last criterion, below), but so are other researchers. Independent sources appear to have been consulted. The story also notes that the author has formed a company to pursue this, which is an important conflict of interest disclosure. Overall, this story feels inappropriately weighted in several ways, and a lack of background information about the state of the science in treatment for Alzheimer’s disease is one of them. The recently failed Eli Lilly trial is mentioned, but there’s no explanation of other prevention and treatment approaches (some of which are based on an entirely different model of the disease) that are currently under investigation. There’s also no sense of just how little can be done for Alzheimer’s patients at this point in time, nor indeed how devastating the condition is for victims and their families. That kind of information would have provided a much-needed context for the results of the study. The story address availability with this statement: “The latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.” OK, quicker and cheaper — but does that mean a year from now or five years or 10? The study author and one external source are quoted explaining that the findings are surprising. Just how novel the approach is would have been better established if the story gave readers background facts about current treatments and results of similar research. For example, other researchers reported earlier this year that light stimulation could purportedly “retrieve lost memories” in Alzheimer’s mice. At the very end we’re told two of the co-authors on the original study are starting a company to investigate therapeutic potential in humans. It would be helpful to know if this company is the first of its kind and whether other researchers are looking into specific types of sensory stimulation as treatment for this disease. The study quotes two independent experts, which is good. But, it uses quotes taken directly from PR materials from the research organization without attribution: Example, this quote: “If humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it’s so non-invasive, and it’s so accessible,” said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper’s senior author. Is taken from here, which published this as: “But if humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it’s so noninvasive, and it’s so accessible.”",1

The examples reproduced above are multiple variants of a long-running hoax, one which warns readers not to allow contact from a particular person or group because dire consequences will result. The basic form of these hoax warnings is typically drawn from the following template:  Variants of these messages are circulated endlessly, with different names swapped in and out as various pranksters decide to play jokes on people they know by inserting their acquaintances’ names and addresses into the warning in place of the existing information. The most common variant of this hoax is one that warns the reader not to accept Facebook friend requests from “hackers” purportedly named “Christopher Davies” and “Jessica Davies,” otherwise one of the two will wreak some unspecified havoc by being able to “FIGURE OUT UR COMPUTER’S ID AND ADDRESS.” (The latest version also incorporates a hoax warning about the non-existent “Dance of the Pope” cell phone virus.) Of course, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that an e-mail message or a link posted on Facebook might carry a virus payload which could infect your computer and allow it be controlled by a botnet, but virus warnings that correspond to the patterns detailed above can be safely dismissed as japes. In March 2009, the “Simon Ashton” variant of this prank was combined with text referencing the hoax version of the Mail Server Report virus warning: Anyone-using Internet mail such as Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL and so on. This information arrived this morning, Direct from both Microsoft and Norton. Please send it to everybody you know who has access to the Internet. You may receive an apparently harmless e-mail titled ‘Mail Server Report’ If you open either file, a message will appear on your screen saying: ‘It is too late now, your life is no longer beautiful.’ Subsequently you will LOSE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PC, And the person who sent it to you will gain access to your name, e-mail and password. This is a new virus which started to circulate on Saturday afternoon. AOL has already confirmed the severity, and the anti virus software’s are not capable of destroying it. The virus has been created by a hacker who calls himself ‘life owner’. PLEASE SEND A COPY OF THIS E-MAIL TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS, And ask them to PASS IT ON IMMEDIATELY! In June 2017, a new variant of the same hoax emerged, with Anwar Jitou (or Anwar Jitu) taking the role of boogeyman on this occasion. The hoax was particularly prevalent among Italian Facebook users, where the warning message typically read like this: Si prega di dire a tutti i contatti della tua lista Messenger, di non accettare il contatto di Anwar Jitou [Anwar Jitu], è un hacker che ha il computer collegato nel tuo account Facebook. Se uno dei tuoi contatti lo accetta, sarai anche hackerato, così fai in modo, che tutti i tuoi amici lo sappiano. It subsequently spread to the English-speaking internet, where Facebook users were told: Please tell all the contacts in your Messenger list not to accept Anwar Jitou’s [Anwar Jitu’s] contact, it’s a hacker that has the computer connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Additional and very popular identical hoaxes in 2017 included the purported hackers Fabrizio Brambilla and Jayden K. Smith … new names, same old hoax. 2018 brought us a West African version: Please tell all the contacts in your messenger list not to accept bright Victor, Desmond kelechi or Sharon Emeka or Okechukwu Anni friendship request is one person using different account and with people’s pictures. He is a hacker and has the system connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. and more American versions: “Please tell all the contacts in your messenger list not to accept friendship request from sherman stuurman . he is a hacker and has the system connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Thanks. Forwarded as received.

"""Donald Trump tied the heroin epidemic gripping suburban white communities to the issue central to the campaign: border security and illegal immigration. The rate of heroin-related overdoses has nearly quadrupled between 2002 and 2013, with more than 8,200 deaths that year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Appearing on CNBC, Trump argued that this too is tied to weak borders. """"Our youth is being poisoned. You go to places like New Hampshire, where it’s the No. 1 thing, heroin, and it comes from the southern border. And you go to Ohio, as an example, I was there two days ago, and the biggest complaint they have is what’s pouring into there,"""" Trump said, before repeating his False claim that Hillary Clinton """"is for open borders."""" We’ve all heard of poppy fields blooming in Afghanistan, but is Trump right that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border? Yes. Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America. """"Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Colombia, dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy US heroin demand,"""" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. """"Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States,"""" the White House’s page on the international heroin market reads. """"Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10,500 hectares in 2012, with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons."""" Here’s a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border:  As you can see, South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades. In recent years, Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves. Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent). By 2014, the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent (South American heroin made up about 17 percent), DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact. This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico. From 2013 to 2015, the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11,000 hectares to 28,000 hectares, according to Baer. In 2008, the total amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border (about 560 kilograms) surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time (about 400 kilograms). Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015 (2,210 kilograms), according to data provided to us by Baer. """"The majority of the drugs in the U.S. market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US. Southwest Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while not the complete picture, provide insight into trafficking trends,"""" he said. Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border (illegally and legally), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast. Here’s a map from the Justice Department that shows how heroin moves through the United States: Our ruling Trump said heroin """"comes from the southern border."""" The vast majority of heroin in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.""",0
"""The article provides no cost estimate for  bioidentical hormone replacement therapy; it does, however provide us with the price of Suzanne Somers book, """"Ageless."""" The possible benefits of the treatment are not quantified. One clinician quote mentioned that these products are without FDA approval and he went on to say that they are ‘potentially quite dangerous’. However – this quote did not differentiate between the possibility that products failed to obtain FDA approval or whether they are exempt from seeking FDA approval (the latter is often the case). It would have been helpful to inform readers what sort of danger potential was being alluded and to provide some way to guage the actual type and size of the risk posed. There is actress testimony about the benefits to be obtained through the use of bioidentical hormones. One clinician is quoted as stating that these products ‘deliver renewed energy and reduced menopausal symptoms’. However – we are not given any sort of metric for gauging these benefits (is the effect seen in all women, some women, or a few women; how large is the effect observed – how was it measured, how long was treatment needed for the effect(s) to be realized). Furthermore – we are not given any sort of assurance that there is actual data supporting these claims. Discussing menopause in terms of a battle """"fighting off nasty symptoms"""" and describing life after menopause as """"constant and progressive deterioration"""" are examples of disease-mongering language. The line """"…without hormones there is no quality of life"""" is another. The major source of information for this article is an interview with the actress Suzanne Somers. Two physicians’ opinions are mentioned – in 84 words – but the actress’ opinions warranted 472 words. The story opened with a statement about ‘the spigot to the hormone fountain of youth’ being ‘practically turned off’. This may have lead readers to conclude that hormone replacement therapy is unavailable or at best difficult to obtain; this is not an accurate representation. The ails listed for menopause included symptoms that are not necessarily linked with menopause; further – there are treatments available for problems such as depression or weakening bones. The story made no mention of treatments other than those hyped in the book. The headline and introduction to the story suggested that the focus would be bioidentical hormones. But they actually received little space in this article. The story should have mentioned the controvery and confusion about the terminology """"bioidenticals""""; some are FDA-approved, but those most generally refer to the unregulated, individually compounded mixtures which are not FDA approved. The treatment of symptoms of menopause with bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is not new but the story never clearly established that. Even the claims made by the actress profiled in the story are not new; she published a 2004 book, """"The Sexy Years: discover the hormone connection."""" Does not appear to rely on a press release.""",1
"Because this story clearly points out that the drug is only part way through the clinical trial process and still has a long way to go before it might be on the market, we can excuse it for not giving cost estimates. Nevertheless,  It would have been informative for readers to have made some comment about the potential economic impact of a cholesterol drug, given that over 20 Million Americans are currently taking statin. On the day that the trial results were announced, Merck stock went up even though the market as a whole sagged, demonstrating the financial implications of this research. The story emphasizes the safety questions that were at the heart of this trial. It also tells readers plainly that it is unknown whether the changes in cholesterol levels seen in this trial have beneficial health effects. It does an impressive job in describing the uncertainties associated with drug manipulation of HDL blood levels. After reporting that the HDL cholesterol numbers rose from 41 mg/dl to 101 mg/dl, the story quotes an independent source saying, “Currently, we’re not convinced that manipulation of HDL matters, though certainly it’s promising.” Unlike some other stories about these trial results, this report repeatedly tells readers that any discussion of real health benefits will have to wait at least until after a trial designed specifically to measure such outcome is conducted. The story reports that anacetrapib did not show the type of harmful effects (including higher blood pressure and higher rates of cardiovascular problems and death) seen in trials of a similar drug, torcetrapib, which was pulled from testing. However, the story does not make it clear that this trial was designed to detect harms that were at least 25 percent more common in the treatment group than in the placebo group… so it was not powerful enough to rule out side effects that were less common than that threshold. This story clearly states more than once that this trial was primarily intended to look at safety, not possible health benefits. The lead sentence says the drug  “seems to have passed an initial hurdle by proving safe in preliminary trials.” Only then does it mention that trial participants on the drug saw substantial changes in their cholesterol numbers compared to the people who were given a placebo, with the “good” HDL cholesterol levels rising and the “bad” LDL cholesterol levels falling. Comments such as “simultaneously excited and leery” and “Don’t take this to the bank” emphasized that the results are welcome news, but far from conclusive. The story accurately reports that the researchers saw a tendency toward better outcomes, but that the trial lasted only 18 months, and as mentioned above, the trial was not designed to demonstrate health effects. Although this story doesn’t give details about the type of patient included in this trial and the only specific reference is not quite accurate; it does not engage in disease-mongering. The story says that this trial included patients with coronary heart disease, but according to the article on the trial in the New England Journal of Medicine the participants also included people who were considered to have a greater than 20 percent chance of a cardiovascular event (heart attack, stroke, etc.) within 10 years according to standard risk models. While the story erred in describing the trial participants, the error portrays the story as relevant to a narrower, rather than a broader, definition of eligible patients. So we’ll say that it doesn’t oversell the potential population that might be offered this sort of drug. Although this story includes a strong lineup of independent sources that put the results in context for readers, it fails to report either that the trial was sponsored by the drug company developing anacetrapib or that the researcher quoted in the story has financial ties to that and other drug companies. Although the story does note that niacin (spelled incorrectly by the way) is the only drug that reliably increases HDL, we would have liked to have seen a bit more information about the role of diet and exercise and how researchers think a CETP inhibitor like anacetrapib (if approved) might fit into the context of other approaches. The story points out that anacetrapib still must be tested in a large clinical trial and is years away from being considered for approval. We’ll give the story a passing score on this criterion because this class of drugs is indeed new and the story did not exaggerate the novelty. However, the story would have been better if it clearly stated that while no drug in this class has been approved for clinical use, there are other drugs at similar stages of testing. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.",0
"""A Fort Worth pediatrician who supports continued federal backing of health insurance for children of the working poor suggested it’s an important issue in these parts because 10 percent of Americans start as Texans. In October 2017, Joyce Mauk, president of the Texas Pediatric Society, was quoted by the Austin American-Statesman as saying: """"One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas, and so it affects us disproportionately if access to health care is compromised for children. There is nothing good you can say about taking away access to health care for children."""" At the time, Congress had failed to extend its authorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program before federal funding expired at the end of September. Without further action, about 400,000 Texas children and pregnant women were believed to be at risk of losing coverage by early 2018. We wondered about the share of U.S.-born babies birthed in Texas. By phone, Mauk told us she relied on statistics compiled from U.S. states by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that 403,618 Texas births accounted for 10 percent of 3,980,000 births nationally in 2015. We were shortly able to confirm that number, thanks to a January 2017 CDC report tabulating U.S. births. It showed 403,618 Texas births in 2015 made up 10.1 percent of 3,978,497 births nationally. Among the states, the chart shows, only California accounted for a greater share; 491,478 births there accounted for 12.4 percent of U.S. births. Next, we asked the CDC and the Texas Demographic Center, based at the University of Texas at San Antonio, about more recent data and figures giving historical perspective. By email, CDC spokesman Brian Tsai pointed us to bureau-posted 2016 birth counts by state, posted in September 2017, showing that the 406,945 births in Texas that year accounted for 10.3 percent of 3,956,112 births nationally. So, the 1-in-10 figure still holds up. In Texas, to our emailed queries, Lila Valencia of the demographic center provided a chart showing that Texas-born babies have comprised 1 in 10 U.S. births since 2008. From 1960 through 1971, the chart indicates, Texas-born babies made up 6 percent of U.S.-born babies. That share, the chart shows, was 7 percent from 1972 through 1979; 8 percent from 1980 through 1995; and 9 percent from 1996 through 2007. Of late, Valencia elaborated, """"the Texas share of births has been steadily increasing, even following drops in the number of births following the Great Recession,"""" Valencia wrote, adding: """"If current total fertility rates and the child-bearing age distribution of women in each state remains the same, we would anticipate the Texas share of births to continue to increase given the younger age distribution of the state, its larger Hispanic share of the population, and its significant population growth relative to other states."""" Our ruling Mauk said 1 in 10 U.S.-born babies is born in Texas. According to government tallies, that’s been so since 2008. The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.""",0
"The news release states that golfers tend to be “relatively well off” and: “… the sport is often perceived as expensive … and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder” The cost to play 18 holes at the course closest to where this review is being written is $27. The fee at St. Andrews Royal and Ancient Golf Club in Scotland — where one of the authors is director of Golf Development — is roughly 10 times that amount. The subtitle of this release claims golf “may not only be good for mind and body, but also for a long life.” More specifically we’re told evidence for this comes from the “systematic review of the available evidence (342 eligible studies)” — and — “the evidence shows that playing golf regularly is associated  with longevity and reducing the risk factors for heart disease/stroke. And it can boost older peoples strength and balance.” Unfortunately, absolutely no data are offered to support these sweeping health claims. The only potential harm from golf mentioned is an increased risk for skin cancer. It’s an important inclusion that prompts us to give a barely passing grade. This nebulous statement is also included: “Compared with other sports, the risk of injury is moderate.” (Rugby and mixed martial arts come to mind). What’s not mentioned is a host of musculoskeletal injuries related to the repetitive and asymmetric nature of swinging a golf club. This study is based on a “modified Delphi method” involving 25 experts “in public health and health policy, and industry leaders.” Their qualifications are not included. The Delphi Method  has experts complete several rounds of anonymous questionnaires with the goal of reaching a consensus. This methodology has several limitations including: it’s subjective, not objective. There are no established guidelines for implementing the surveys. The goal is to reach a convergence of opinion, and — most importantly — the resulting consensus does not equate with causation. Not mentioning the study method and its limitations is a major weakness of this news release. No disease mongering noted. This is the second major weakness of this news release. It’s not mentioned that this “2018 Consensus Statement on Golf and Health” was funded by an unrestricted grant from the World Golf Foundation. Two of the authors receive fees from the European Golf tour and one is the director of Golf Development at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews, Scotland. Golf is often referred to as “a good walk spoiled.” Common sense would suggest many of the benefits touted in this news release might also hold for a good walk or hike; unfortunately, no alternatives are mentioned. Golf is widely available worldwide. But as suggested in the release it may be prove unaffordable for many. This news release does not present golf as a novel form of exercise. But we think it clearly overreaches in suggesting a host of health benefits through a news release —  without any supporting evidence. There is no news here, just promotion. Given there is no study here, and the basis of the health claims is nothing more than a subjective consensus statement of experts (some with major conflicts of interest), we find the headline and health recommendations of this news release to be unjustified and overreaching.",1
"""House Democratic leaders last week released the health care bill they plan to bring to the floor, and it didn't take long for the Republicans to publish a laundry list of complaints about it. We'll be exploring those complaints with a story we'll publish later today or tomorrow, but in the meantime, we'd like to explore one of the points made by Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota. She made the statement on Oct. 30, 2009, on Sean Hannity's show on the Fox News Channel. She said that on Page 92 of the new bill, """"it says specifically that people can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain, which means people will ultimately go into a single-payer plan where it is government providing health care and only one single government system. That's why this is so bad, Sean. This is socialized medicine ... This is, as I said, the crown jewel of socialism. It's what Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid have wanted from the very beginning."""" (See her comments starting about the 2:15 mark in  this video  .) We won't rate her opinion that Democrats are proposing the """"crown jewel"""" of socialized medicine, or her prediction that it will ultimately lead to a single-payer system. Instead, we're interested in Bachmann's claim that Page 92 of the bill prevents people from buying private health insurance after a certain date. We not only find that she is misinterpreting that one page, but that she's also distorting the other 1,989 pages of a bill that would construct a system largely based on private health insurance. Her claim is a serious misrepresentation of a plan that relies on a marketplace of private coverage. Bachmann's office did not respond to our call or an e-mail, but we found the language that she seemed to be referring to on Page 91 of the new bill: """"The individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1."""" To decipher it, we called Karen Pollitz, project director for the Health Policy Institute at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. She said it was a clause that allows people who would be eligible for coverage in the new health care exchange to keep an old policy they like. """"If you have a plan that's in effect prior to the effective date (of the exchange) and you like it, you can keep it,"""" she said. (This is similar to a claim we checked back in July when the editorial page of  Investor's Business Daily  said the bill  would outlaw private insurance  . We rated that .) Here's how the exchange would work: Under the House bill, insurance companies would sell individual policies through a government-run health care exchange, and the government would set minimum standards for coverage. For example, the government would require companies to cover people even if they have pre-existing conditions such as serious illnesses or pregnancy. The government would also set levels for minimum coverage for services such as mental health coverage. But if someone liked a plan they owned before the new law kicks in, they'd be able to keep the policy, no matter the level of coverage. The rules would largely prevent insurance companies from changing benefits in these grandfathered plans or altering the premiums. So Bachmann is referring to language that prevents the health insurance companies from enrolling new people in old plans that don't meet the new standards, Pollitz said. Any plan sold after the new law is enacted must provide better coverage. Bachmann is incorrect that people """"can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain."""" To the contrary, a key principle of the bill is to create a new marketplace for people to buy private insurance. People who already get private coverage from their employer would continue to do so and should be able to shop for new plans with different coverage. People who are self-employed or work for small businesses will be able to buy private insurance through the new exchange. In fact, the bill requires that everyone have some form of coverage, Pollitz said. """"Not only do you have to [buy insurance], but you can"""" buy it after the bill goes into effect, she said. """"There's no reasonable way to look at Page (91) and say that you couldn't."""" Bachmann isn't just guilty of misinterpreting the language from one page of the bill. She's taken that misinterpretation to a ridiculous extreme — the claim that no private insurance could be sold after a certain date. That ignores the central tenet of a plan that's been discussed for months — that the plan would rely on a marketplace of private insurance.""",1
"The desire for revenge runs deep in all of us. Everyone who has ever been wronged has at one time or another felt the urge to strike a counterblow. Most of us don’t indulge in this pursuit because we’ve deemed the cost of getting even too high to justify the benefits gained, yet we revel in thoughts of comeuppances doled out by others. Such imaginings give us the chance to vicariously experience the joys of retribution, joys we’re not likely to sample in real life, such as the following:  I’ve heard that barmaids and cocktail waitresses have a secret for getting rid of obnoxious customers. Seems they use the eye medication Visine for a little Montezuma’s revenge. A few eyedrops in someone’s drink can apparently leave him sitting on the toilet for the rest of the evening with a nasty case of “the runs.”  The “Visine slipped into the drink” pay back carries additional appeal because it seems to offer an effective yet harmless form of retaliation that could be easily and furtively administered even by the wimpiest of revenge seekers. Also, the mental image of an enemy sent hotfooting for the toilet is a hugely satisfying one, especially in a society that views fecal output as something to be ashamed of. An act of spite that forces the victim into making repeated visits to the john is regarded as not only extremely inconveniencing to him, but degrading as well. Yet all is not well in revenge land. While it is true that Visine is readily obtainable (it’s an non-prescription eye drop manufactured by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer), a drink spiked with it is not a sure-fire means of producing diarrhea in the one unfortunate enough to swallow it, and ingestion of such a concoction is downright dangerous, making this “harmless” form of retaliation fraught with hazard. The active ingredient in Visine eye drops is Tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%. Swallowing this substance can result in a number of nasty effects, including:  Pfizer’s cautions  to users of Visine include: “If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.” In view of the above list, that advice should not be taken lightly. One thing tetrahydrozoline has not been known to do is to cause sudden onset bouts of severe diarrhea. Although this belief has been around for decades, and everyone knows someone who knows someone who really did administer a Visine mickey to a deserving miscreant and thereby caused him an immediate serious case of the trots, there’s no documented evidence the producthas that effect. Of all the Visine poisoning cases studied by medical observers, we found none that mentioned diarrheal output brought about by the drug. Yet if Visine doesn’t cause diarrhea, it has done things far more terrible. Drinking it can (and has) caused severe depression of the central nervous system. In 1996, a two-year-old child who ingested at most 2 to 3 mL of Visine eye drops became dangerously lethargic and unresponsive to every stimulus except deep pain. Thanks to prompt medical attention the child recovered, but not before enduring intubation and two days’ worth of mechanically-assisted breathing. In June 2014, a 22-year-old woman named Samantha Elizabeth Unger was arrested in Thurmont, Maryland, and charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of children. According to police, Unger confessed to poisoning her 3-year-old son by putting Visine in his water bottle and juice bottle (the boy was hospitalized several times but survived) and also causing her 1-year-old son to fall ill when he accidentally consumed the poisoned drinks she had made for his brother. In January 2015 Unger pleaded guilty to six counts of aggravated assault of a victim less than six years old and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. Medical literature reports other cases of small children brought to the brink of crisis by ingestion of tiny amounts of over-the-counter eye drops. The danger is real, and parents are well advised to keep eye drops away from children. Yet it is not only toddlers who risk central nervous system shutdown or other dire results if they swallow Visine, as demonstrated by the following examples:            Revenge seekers still not quite convinced that a Visine mickey finn won’t produce the diarrheal results they crave, or that the drinking of such a potion could potentially result in a life-threatening medical crisis in the object of their prank, should consider one final fact: the act of secreting noxious substances in ingestibles for the purpose of bringing harm to others is called poisoning. It matters not if actual harm results from the attempt — the act itself is enough to land one in the hoosegow. Sightings:   In an episode of television’s CSI (“Revenge Is Best Served Cold,” original air date 26 September 2002), a drink spiked in this fashion caused a death when the eye drops initiated a fatal reaction with chocolate the victim had eaten.",1
"Costs are not discussed at all. Given that this release was issued by the manufacturer of Kyleena, the oversight is especially odd. If anyone would be able to speak to potential cost, it would be them. The product appears to be similar to another birth control product also marketed by Bayer, called Mirena. It is not easy to find a clear price for Mirena, but a 2014 story on the site ClearHealthCosts says that Mirena costs in the neighborhood of $700 or $800 — not including any medical fees related to having the device put into place. It is also not clear whether Kyleena may be covered by insurance plans. This gets a satisfactory rating, but it’s really a toss-up. First, the release does offer information on the rate of (presumably unexpected) pregnancies among patients who were using Kyleena. That’s good, and is why we award a satisfactory rating here. However, the information is provided based on the Pearl Index, which most readers are unlikely to be familiar with. The Pearl Index is commonly regarded as a standard metric for evaluating contraceptive effectiveness. The effectiveness of Kyleena is cited as 1.45 pregnancies per 100 women over 5 years of use. That can be compared with other available levonorgestrel products approved for 5 years, which contain higher amounts of active hormone (52 mg levonorgestrel vs 19.5 in Kyleena) and have slightly better effectiveness (0.5 to 1.1 pregnancies per 100 women). An additional benefit of the higher-dose levonorgestrel IUDs for some women is reduction in menstrual bleeding (30-50% of women stop having periods after 2 years of use), as well as reduction in volume of menstrual flow and menstrual cramps. There is no data cited on Kyleena’s effects on these outcomes. The release would have been stronger if it had placed the information in better context. How does it compare to other, similar birth control methods — such as Mirena, which we mentioned above? We’ll address this at greater length below, under the Compare Alternatives criterion. The release goes into this at length, which is good. What would have been even better would have been for the release to compare the likelihood of potential side effects for Kyleena with the likelihood of side effects for other products on the market. The release describes the relevant clinical trial in detail, earning this a satisfactory rating. That said, there is one question that the release does not address at all — whether the trial had a control group. That’s an important point, and it’s not clear why this issue isn’t addressed. There is a strong implication that there was no control group. The lack of control group is not necessarily a problem since the main outcome of interest is prevention of pregnancy. A control group would be helpful in putting the rates of adverse effects into context. No disease mongering here. The release is clearly marked as being from the manufacturer of Kyleena. This is not satisfactory on two levels. First, Kyleena is described as an intrauterine system that releases levonorgestrel in order to prevent pregnancy, and it is described preventing pregnancy for up to five years. Another product from Bayer, Mirena, is an intrauterine device that releases levonorgestrel in order to prevent pregnancy. It also is described as preventing pregnancy for up to five years. When a company is releasing a new product that, to the non-expert audience, looks an awful lot like an existing product, the company needs to clearly describe how the products are different — in terms of mechanism, benefit, cost and risk. Other levonorgestrel-releasing devices/implants include Liletta and Skyla. How does Kyleena differ from them? Second, and more broadly, the efficacy of Kyleena at preventing unwanted pregnancy is not compared to the broader suite of birth control options available. All in all, this is a significant oversight. Potential users of Kyleena should be able to clearly compare the costs, risks and benefits of the new product to existing products. And if the product is as advantageous as the manufacturer wants the market to believe, an up-front comparison would actually help convince consumers. There are two classes of levonorgestrel IUDs currently on the market that vary in the amount of active hormone they contain: 1) 52 mg IUDs (Mirena and Liletta) and 2) a 13.5 mg IUD (Skyla). There are two important differences between them. First, the higher dose IUDs are effective for five years, whereas the lower dose Skyla is effective for three years. Second, there are differences in side effects, which for some women may make one preferable to the other. Mirena and Liletta can reduce the frequency and amount of bleeding, as well as menstrual cramping; Skyla has little effect on these factors. With a lower dose of levonorgestrel  IUD (19.5 mg) compared to the other 5-year IUDs, Kyleena would seem to be Bayer’s effort to create a lower dose IUD that is effective for 5 years. In this context, it would be especially helpful to know how its “side effects” (whether beneficial or not) compare to those of the other IUDs. The release states that Kyleena will be available by prescription in October 2016. As noted above, it’s not clear from this release (at least to a non-expert audience) how Kyleena differs from other, intrauterine levonorgestrel-releasing products that are already on the market. The release doesn’t engage in sensationalistic language. The release may be slightly out-of-bounds, however, when it states, at the top, that “Kyleena offers women an important new long-term, reversible contraception option.”  Who decides what makes something “important”? It’s a tricky question. Based on the limited information in the release, it’s not clear that the term applies here or that the product offers significant differences from other products already on the market.",0
"""In his quest for the women’s vote. Democrat Charlie Crist continues to attack Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s record on abortion. """"After it happened, Rick Scott threw a party back at the mansion. What was he celebrating?"""" says the Sept. 30 TV ad. """"This: with a stroke of a pen Scott passed some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country. Laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest."""" """"Rick Scott celebrated taking away your voice and your choice,"""" the ad concludes. We have written a lot about Crist’s record of conflicting statements about abortion -- though in this campaign he has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. Scott, meanwhile, has consistently favored abortion restrictions. We wanted to know if the ad accurately presented what Scott signed into law. We found it was largely correct; Scott did sign legislation that restricted access to abortion. But there a few details here that are important. Scott signed ultrasound bill in 2011 In 2011, Scott signed four abortion-related bills, including one that required all women to receive an ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. Crist had vetoed a similar ultrasound law in 2010, calling it """"almost mean-spirited."""" That was shortly after he left the GOP for his failed bid as an independent candidate for U.S. Senate. The law Scott signed requires women to get the ultrasound as well as an opportunity to review the ultrasound and have it explained to them. (Women can decline to review the ultrasound if they sign a form.) Previously, Florida law required ultrasounds prior to second trimester or later abortions, not first trimester abortions. Though the former law didn’t require first trimester ultrasounds, 29 of 31 abortion clinics did them anyway. The Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog reported that a month after signing the bills in 2011, Scott held a ceremonial signing with dozens of abortion opponents -- that’s the """"party"""" that the ad references. """"You should have the opportunity to see see an ultrasound of your child,"""" Scott said in 2011. """"It's your choice. You don't have to. This creates choice. I think it's very positive."""" Abortion law about viability in 2014 Crist’s ad also says Scott signed a law """"restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest."""" That refers to HB 1047, which Scott signed in 2014 to change the timeline for cutting off abortions. The bill banned abortions once a fetus is considered viable, which is typically around 23 or 24 weeks of gestation. Previously, Florida banned abortions in the third trimester, or starting about two weeks later than the new restriction. The main purpose of the 2014 bill was to make all abortions occur earlier -- no matter if the pregnancies were a result of rape or incest. The new law only allows abortion after the point of viability to save the woman’s life or prevent major permanent damage """"other than a psychological condition."""" It doesn’t mention rape or incest. The previous law didn’t mention rape or incest, but it did include a broad exception to """"preserve the health of the pregnant woman."""" That broad language was what some people interpreted to potentially include rape or incest survivors. In reality, however, no woman has received a third-trimester abortion under any exception between 2011 and so far in 2014, according to state data. In 2013, 91 percent of abortions were in the first trimester and 9 percent in the second trimester, according to state data. So that means that women who want to terminate pregnancies that occurred as a result of rape or incest can still do so in the first semester and most of the second trimester -- depending on when a doctor determines viability. Rape and incest are rarely cited in abortions, according to state data. In 2013 there were about 73,000 abortions -- two were in cases of incest and about 272 due to rape -- so combined that equals less than one percent. At the time, Scott spokesman John Tupps wrote in a statement about the law that """"Gov. Scott is pro-life and was glad to sign this bill that protects the lives of children."""" We asked Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair if Scott supports the rape/incest exception throughout pregnancy or only until the point of viability and Blair told us that he supports those exceptions in """"all cases."""" We asked why Scott then signed the law this session that doesn’t include those exceptions. We didn’t get a response. Finally, the ad said Scott signed """"some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country."""" That’s a subjective call, but we should note that Florida hasn’t had widespread clinic closures. A Texas law caused 13 abortion clinics to close there. In Florida, there were 68 abortion clinics when Scott took office and there are 65 now. (Seven closed under Scott, but four new ones opened.) And, Florida had restrictive laws about abortion before Scott took office. Americans United for Life, a group that opposes abortion rights, ranked Florida 26th among states for restricting abortion in 2010 and 25th among states in 2014. NARAL, an organization that supports abortion rights, has given an """"F"""" to about half the states, including Florida. Our ruling Crist said in an ad that Scott signed """"laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest."""" Scott signed a law in 2011 that requires ultrasounds for all women before they get an abortion, and in 2014 he signed a law that stated women could not have an abortion after the point of viability. That means women could not have an abortion about two weeks earlier than before. The only stated exception was to save the woman's life. However, the previous law didn’t expressly include those exceptions either, though it had broad language that could potentially have been used to seek abortion for a rape or incest survivor in the third trimester. No woman, though, has had an abortion in Florida during the third trimester for any reason in recent years, even before the new law. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information.""",0
"Experts say disentangling folklore from fact is not easy in fitness, where misconceptions are as pervasive as push-ups and as stubborn as love handles. Jennifer Burke, a fitness manager at a Crunch gym in West Hollywood, California, said many women still worry that weight training will create big and bulky muscles. “Women say ‘I don’t want to get bulky,’ but unless you take in extra calories or testosterone supplements, that’s just not going to happen,” said Burke, who eases reluctant clients into resistance training gently, with body-weight exercises. “When they see their bodies getting long lean muscles, getting toned, they trust you a little more and you can start adding in dumbbells and machines,” Burke said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults engage in muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups - legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms - two or more days a week. “A lot of people think if they want to lose a lot of weight they should do cardio, but the best thing is to add in resistance training as well,” Burke said. “You’ll get bigger, faster results because you’re working on lean muscle tissue which burns more calories in the long run.”  While it’s true that muscle weighs more than fat, it’s also more compact. “Five pounds (2.3 kilograms) of muscle is the size of your fist. Five pounds of fat is the size of your forearm” she said. Burke added that another misconception is that lower-intensity exercise such as the fat-burning setting on most cardio machines is better for burning calories. “That’s absolutely not true,” said Burke. “If you increase the intensity you’ll burn more calories.”  The CDC’s rule of thumb is that one minute of vigorous-intensity activity is about the same as two minutes of moderate-intensity activity. Stephanie Huckabee, a South Carolina-based fitness instructor, said people who believe it is necessary to exercise every day are setting themselves up for failure. “I tell my clients to expect days when they don’t exercise,” said Huckabee. “That’s just being realistic.”  Another fiction, Huckabee said, is that you can move fat away from a problem area. “When I wanted to reduce my stomach, I had to do an all-over conditioning program to get that fat tissue to shrink,” she said. “Cardio will burn the fat over all. After that, you can work on sculpting an area with resistance training.”  Burke said one of the biggest fitness myths is that crunches can banish belly fat. “You build your six-pack in the kitchen,” she said, while noting that no one will see even the most developed abdominals if they’re hiding under a layer of fat. Moira Merrithew, co-founder of Merrithew Health & Fitness, said one of the most common misconceptions is that it’s always good to stretch before a game of football or a run. “For some athletes probably the worst thing they can do is stretch before they run,” said Merrithew, who is based in Toronto, Canada. “There’s simply no hard and fast rule,” said Merrithew, a former dancer. “Pilates is good for dancers before they go out, because it mobilizes the joints. There are so many effects that stretching can and cannot have. There are limits to really pushing that stretch.”  And even the most dedicated couch potato cannot turn muscle to fat, according to Carol Torgan, a consultant exercise physiologist with the American College of Sports Medicine. “Muscles and fat are two different types of cells. It would be like turning apples into oranges,” she said. More troubling is the fallacy that one can never drink too much water. “It can result in a condition known as hyponatremia, in which there is an imbalance of water to salt,” Torgan said. “This is also known as water intoxication or over-hydration, and can be extremely serious.”",0
"The costs of screening vary dramatically, not only by test but also by the terms of a person’s health care insurance coverage. Insurance may completely cover the cost of screening, but depending on their insurance, people who get follow-up tests to check a suspicious screening test result may get hit with thousands of dollars in medical bills. Especially since the task force highlighted the importance of individuals deciding on the right type of colon cancer screening for themselves, which certainly includes their insurance coverage, the story should have mentioned costs. Also, though not directly addressed in these guidelines, it is worth noting that colon cancer screening is covered under the Affordable Care Act, but that workup of an abnormal screening test may not be. The story does not quantify the benefits of the different colon cancer screening methods. While we’re sympathetic to the challenges of doing so on deadline–especially when the task force went out of its way to not cover this ground–this nonetheless should have been included. The effectiveness of different screening tests differ, as well as the quality of that evidence, and readers would welcome knowing these differences in quantified terms. The story should have mentioned some of the potential harms of screening, ranging from anxiety over a worrisome result to bleeding, colon perforation, sedation-related events and other problems. Also, since the story specifically included comments lauding colonoscopy, it should have also mentioned that colonoscopy accounts for most of the serious harms caused by colon cancer screening. The USPSTF recommendation is the result of not only a structured review of available studies on colon cancer screening, but also new analyses of the data, in order to seek a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of various screening strategies. Though the story could have done a lot more to explain that, enough of the basics are included to warrant a Satisfactory here. The story ideally would have explained what sets this recommendation apart from other reports that come from various groups of experts giving their opinions. Also, it should have noted that the USPSTF gave the recommendation for screening between ages 50 and 75 an “A” grade (the highest level of confidence), while screening of those over 75 (based on individual considerations) received only a “C” grade (moderate certainty). If anything, this story more restrained than the USPSTF recommendation, which strongly urges colon cancer screening, saying that the biggest problem is that nearly one-third of eligible adults have never been screened. The story includes comments from a physician who is not on the USPSTF and who expresses a different viewpoint. We won’t mark down the story for not discussing conflicts of interest because the USPSTF is a voluntary, publicly-funded body and none of the members reported any conflicts in their disclosure forms. The story lists all the screening techniques the USPSTF looked at. It notes that the report intentionally did not rank the techniques and includes a dissenting opinion from a physician who was not part of the task force. It was also worth mentioning that an average risk person who is informed about the screening may chose not to be screened as a reasonable choice, but only as part of a shared decision making process with her/his doctor. It is clear that all of the screening tests mentioned in the story are generally available. The story points out that this report and recommendation is an update of one the USPSTF issued in 2008. It is clear that all of the screening tests mentioned in the story have been available for years, except for a DNA-based stool test that the story notes was approved recently. The story includes comments from an independent physician, which is enough to squeak by as Satisfactory on this rating. However, it should be noted that all of the comments from the USPSTF came from a news release. Although the story clearly attributes the source of the USPSTF comments, which is good, ideally there would also have been at least some original commentary directly from task force members, providing unique insights not found in the news release.",0
"There’s no direct cost to walking an hour a day, so we won’t ding the story for omitting discussion of cost. However, there is clearly a time cost involved, and many people may struggle to find the time for exercise if it means less time for paying work or caregiving. Others, especially older adults, may have medical problems that preclude the exercise. We wish the story had mentioned these factors. The story provides no numbers. It doesn’t tell us how much risk of death is increased by sitting 8 hours a day, or how much it is reduced by exercise. It tells us that “Not exercising and sitting all day is as dangerous as being obese or smoking,” but how dangerous is that? We can’t think of any harms from engaging in a brisk hour-long walk. Injury is always a possibility, but that’s apparent enough that we don’t think the story was obligated to discuss this. The story inappropriately uses cause-and-effect language in the headline and elsewhere that overstates what this study can tell us (e.g. “To reverse damage of sitting, take a brisk, hour-long walk”). It should have said that walking, sitting, etc. are “associated with” or “linked to” health effects, but not that walking can “undo” or “reverse” damage. In the study itself, the researchers provide a long list of limitations that suggest a lack of certainty regarding the strength of these conclusions. But the story did not report on any of them. For example, the researchers state,”we attempted to minimise bias from reverse causation (ie, illness causing individuals to become sedentary) by including apparently healthy participants; however, we cannot fully rule this bias out.”  What this means is that the results could be skewed by individuals who had undiagnosed, subclinical disease that caused them to become less likely to exercise. While the assumption is that lack of exercise makes people sick, perhaps the reverse is true in some cases, which would obviously affect results from a study such as this one. No disease-mongering. The story gets credit here for quoting the author of an accompanying editorial. But we’d point out that it probably wouldn’t have been hard to find someone who would have looked at the study more critically and offered some comment on its limitations. The story is basically a comparison of the competing effects of exercise vs. sedentary behavior. The story addresses this as an issue with this line: Andersen said that some cultures make it easier than others to squeeze in an hour of exercise every day, noting that in Denmark and much of Scandinavia, about half of all people either cycle or walk to work. Although the story nods to previous research, noting that “Previous studies have found that prolonged sitting can raise the chances of heart disease, various cancers and an earlier death,” it doesn’t explain that this study is meant to address a specific issue that has generated conflicting results in previous research. Here’s how the researchers put it: Two other meta-analyses had examined the associations of sitting time with non-communicable disease incidence and mortality. One of these concluded that prolonged sitting time was associated with increased risks of deleterious health outcomes regardless of physical activity level, whereas the other concluded that physical activity (no details on the amount of activity were provided) seemed to attenuate the increased risk of all-cause mortality due to high sitting. In other words, this newer study was attempting to answer this question: Given the conflicting results from older research, what role does physical activity play, if any, in counteracting prolonged daily sitting? Although the story quotes from a news release, it acknowledges the source of the quotation and also includes an interview with the author of the accompanying commentary. It’s apparent that there was some independent reporting done here.",0
"A 14-year old schoolgirl has suffered serious complications after a flu shot allegedly left the young girl terribly ill and with severe cramps, until the family doctor finally realized weeks later she had been impregnated by the vaccine, reports the Forth Worth Telegram this week. “She had all the typical symptoms of a pregnant woman. It’s not the first time a young woman falls pregnant without the consent of her parents, but the girl seemed sincere when she said she had never had sexual relations with a boy, and she urged me to check her hymen, which I eventually did, and to my utter surprise, the hymen was fully intact. It is impossible she has been impregnated by male sperm” she assures. “In my 26 years of practice, I have never heard once of such a thing as someone being impregnated by a vaccine, but I did some research and found out it is more common than most people think”. The claim cleverly layered the suggestion of a falsehood within its own fabrication to facilitate the spread of the story. Due to that sleight of hand, readers surmised the girl had lied about her sexual experience and had blamed the flu vaccine to deflect suspicion about the true nature of her pregnancy. None of this (neither the girl’s claims nor the article reporting them) was true, however. World News Daily Report is just one of many fake news sites that print fictitious articles, as noted in their disclaimer:",1
"""There are many unanswered questions about the connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly, a birth defect in which the baby’s head is much smaller than expected. Not every baby of an infected woman develops this syndrome, and the mechanism by which the virus might affect the fetus is uncertain. But moving around on the Internet is an entirely different take on the tie between Zika and microcephaly. It doesn’t exist, according to certain blogs, tweets and articles on conspiracy-leaning websites. The Canadian-based Centre for Research on Globalization, a group that advances ideas it feels the """"mainstream press"""" ignores, had an article Feb. 4, 2016, from Dr. Gary Kohls that challenged the linkage theory and said the primary suspect is DTaP,  a common vaccination to prevent whooping cough (along with tetanus and diphtheria). """"In the whole week of reports that I heard or read about, not a single interviewer asked about – and not a single ‘expert’ or mainstream journalists ever mentioned the most likely triggering cause of the epidemic, and that is the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic, aluminum that was in every DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated (early in 2015) by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women – and therefore into their fetuses,"""" Kohls wrote. So is DTaP is the """"most likely triggering cause"""" of microcephaly? Most of Kohls’ article describes why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pharmaceutical companies and researchers would care to blame the Zika virus rather than the vaccine, but its main point is the overlap of the microcephaly incidence and Brazil’s immunization campaign. Brazil did begin vaccinating pregnant women starting in late 2014. (Hat tip to Brazilian fact-checker Cristina Tardáguila at Lupa News.) However, according to the Brazilian Health Department press release, the vaccine they distributed was a version called Tdap. This was part of an international push to reduce whooping cough in infants. Inoculating mothers late in pregnancy allowed them to pass antibodies to their unborn children. For the rest of this fact-check, we look at Tdap. The Web article named the incorrect vaccine, but if there’s any merit to Kohls’ case -- and there isn’t -- it lies with the vaccine Brazil used. Kohl also wrote that """"there are 35 other countries across the globe that have confirmed cases of Zika virus illness, but none are having any microcephaly reports."""" The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control does show about that number of countries and territories where Zika has been found, but in 13 of those places, there are few cases. Either no instances of Zika have been found in the past two months, or the number of cases was less than 10. So it’s a bit misleading to suggest that the absence of microcephaly disproves the link between the birth defect and the Zika virus. If we find more detailed statistics on the number of cases of Zika and microcephaly, we’ll update this item, but there’s a much bigger problem with Kohls’ statement. Evidence on the safety of Tdap The weakest part of the argument that Tdap plays a role in microcephaly is that  pregnant women in the United States, and elsewhere, have been getting the vaccine and there is no hint of a connection to microcephaly. Elyse Kharbanda is a top national researcher on vaccine safety at HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research in Minneapolis. """"Our research has not shown any link between Tdap vaccination in pregnant women and microcephaly in their children,"""" Kharbanda told us. Melissa Brower in the CDC press office reiterated that point. """"Our safety monitoring is continuous,"""" Brower said. """"We have not observed any unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that would indicate a potential safety problem with maternal Tdap vaccination and microcephaly as a birth outcome."""" A 2015 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association included over 29,000 pregnant women in six states. It found no problems of any birth defects for any woman who was vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy. Another JAMA study looked at over 26,000 pregnant women in California and reached the same conclusion. Researchers at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program further affirm the safety of Tdap. Director and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases Buddy Creech said nothing shows any link between the vaccine and microcephaly or any other birth defect. Creech also noted that the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, between weeks 27 and 36. That timing is important. """"Most organ development and structural changes are occurring in the first trimester,"""" Creech said. """"It’s after the period of most intense organ development, so it removes the question of whether a vaccine caused congenital heart disease, etc."""" However, the CDC says in some cases, microcephaly can occur after the first trimester, so in theory, a vaccination could overlap with the onset of microcephaly. But that doesn’t change the rest of the research pattern. The United Kingdom launched a vaccination program in 2012, making Tdap available to about 700,000 pregnant women. Researchers looked at the impact on about 20,000 of them and found no increase in pregnancy risks. On a related note, the New England Journal of Medicine reports that the Zika virus was found in the brain tissue of an aborted fetus suffering from microcephaly. While this says nothing about the role of Tdap, it does directly link the Zika virus to a particular birth defect. We contacted the editors at the Centre for Research on Globalization and they said they forwarded our questions to Kohls. If we hear back, we’ll update this item. Our ruling An online article on the website of the Centre for Research of Globalization said the DTaP vaccine is the mostly likely cause of microcephaly in Brazil. First of all, Brazil used Tdap, a slightly different version of the vaccine. More important, not a bit of evidence supports the assertion that either variety lies behind microcephaly. Many thousands of pregnant women in the United States and around the world have been getting this vaccine for at least five years and multiple studies have found no ill effects on their babies. Not a single study has raised a red flag for any birth defect and certainly not microcephaly. In addition, administering the vaccine later in pregnancy reduces the likelihood that it will interfere with fetal development. The statement is inaccurate in every respect including naming the wrong version of the vaccine used in Brazil.""",1
"""Federal, state and local leaders are constantly searching for every spare dollar or threatening to raise taxes to keep things running in this sluggish economy. So it surprised us when Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed made this claim when discussing his first-year accomplishments:  """"When I came in, the reserves of the city of Atlanta were $7.4 million,"""" Reed said in a speech to the YMCA Hungry Club lunch forum on Nov. 30. """"As I stand here ... the reserves of the city of Atlanta are in excess of $56 million."""" How did the city get this done? Are the city's numbers correct? Atlanta, like most governments, has several accounts to manage its finances. The main account the city uses to pay for most services (police, fire, parks and recreation) is called the """"general fund."""" Some city services, such as water and sewer service, are paid through different funds. The general fund, which currently has a budget of about $560 million, is paid for through a combination of property taxes, sales taxes, business licenses, a hotel/motel tax it shares with state government, permits, court fines and other sources. Atlanta's budget year, which the city calls """"fiscal year,"""" begins July 1 and ends June 30. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009, the city says it had a reserve fund of about $7.4 million. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, the mayor says the city's general fund reserve is at least $56 million. Some city data show the total is $58 million, which drew Reed some praise from New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in a Christmas Day column. So how does the city say it got there? It began in June 2009, when the City Council voted 8-7 to put $27 million in its general fund reserve and raised property taxes by about $240 for the average city homeowner. Then-Mayor Shirley Franklin and her staff felt the city eventually needed a rainy day fund of about $100 million to protect the city if the economy falters, in hopes of avoiding what happened in 2008, when Atlanta, after feeling the first ripples of the recession, laid off several hundred employees and cut back a host of services. Skyrocketing employee pension costs, falling revenue from the recession and some bad long-standing budgeting practices were found to be the primary culprits of the financial troubles at City Hall. A key moment in building its reserves took place in the early months of 2009. The Franklin administration was conservative in its estimates of how much it would receive in revenue during fiscal year 2010. It expected scores of property owners to appeal their assessments, said Duriya Farooqui, a top city official under Franklin who is now one of Reed's deputy chief operating officers. Lower assessments typically mean lower property values. Lower property values mean less paid in property taxes, which account for approximately 35 percent of Atlanta's general fund revenue. As a result of the conservative estimates, city officials say revenue was $13 million above expectations. A city spreadsheet for May 2010 offers a further glimpse into the mayor's claim. In addition to showing higher-than-expected revenue, several city agencies spent much less than budgeted. By the end of June, the following departments were under budget: In many cases, city officials say some vacant positions were not filled. Atlanta said two departments, Corrections and Public Works, were over budget by a combined $2.6 million. Farooqui said Reed and his staff told department heads on track to spend less than budgeted to end the fiscal year at those lower levels. The city also got help from the federal government. The Obama administration gave Atlanta nearly $5 million in stimulus funds it used for job training, Farooqui said. Atlanta also re-examined its lease agreements and engaged in new spending practices, Farooqui said. By this past June, the end of the city's fiscal year, Atlanta officials reported a general fund balance of $68 million. City officials said they were able to add nearly $12.3 million to the reserve through principal and other interest payments. That includes the $27 million reserve, the higher-than-expected revenue and controlled spending. Under city guidelines, one-quarter of that money must be used for large-scale projects. Subtract that and Atlanta is left with about $51 million. Once you carry the $7 million in the reserve fund from fiscal year 2009, the reserve is about $58 million. City Councilman Howard Shook, chairman of the council's budget committee in 2008 and 2009, said he does not dispute the mayor's math. Shook said the city has tighter fiscal management, largely aided by Atlanta's new (albeit over-budget) Oracle computer system that better tracks spending. The councilman said the painful budget cuts in 2008 and the council's decision to raise property taxes in 2009 helped. """"A lot of the most painful medicine was taken before the new administration came in,"""" Shook said. Roger Lusby III, a certified public accountant, looked at some of the city's monthly budget spreadsheets at AJC PolitiFact's request. Lusby said Atlanta's numbers seem accurate, but he wanted to see more information about its reserves, how the city is handling its massive pension liability and how it manages its severance pay. Those and other factors, Lusby said, may give him a better idea of how solid the city's surplus estimate is. Lusby said he would reserve ruling that the city's claim is true until its books are audited by an independent firm, which city officials said is scheduled to be done early this year. """"I think [Reed] is doing a good job, but I hope he's working with accurate information,"""" said Lusby, managing partner of the Alpharetta office of Frazier & Deeter, a certified public accounting firm. The spreadsheets show Reed's claim seems on the money. But, as Lusby noted, the city's fiscal year 2010 books haven't been audited. Farooqui said """"there is no reason to believe the numbers will change dramatically"""" after the audit. Since there's additional information that may come from the audit, we reserve the right to change the ruling if there is significant information that shows the city's numbers were on target or incorrect. For now, we'll be a little conservative here and rate Reed's statement as .""",0
"""In the only debate between major-party candidates for Texas lieutenant governor, Republican nominee Dan Patrick stood by his objections to a Texas law authored by his Democratic opponent that enables some children living in the state without legal authorization to qualify for in-state college tuition. Patrick, a Houston state senator, went on to say Sept. 29, 2014, that after the tuition proposal passed into law in 2001, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, the Democratic nominee, supported another questionable move. """"She voted to give illegal immigrants in this country free health care -- not emergency health care but total free health care,"""" Patrick said. """"That was about seven years ago and that bill didn’t pass."""" We were curious about the described vote. By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick was referring to Van de Putte’s vote for a proposal that cleared the Senate in 2003, Senate Bill 309. Garcia said the legislation required """"local hospitals to provide emergency care to patients regardless of immigration status. Opponents claimed the bill would drive up the costs of health care and increase taxes to provide care to illegal immigrants. Van de Putte supported this measure knowing that it would benefit illegal immigrants at a cost to taxpayers,"""" Garcia wrote. We’d been down this path with Patrick before. In May 2014, we rated  his claim that the Senate had earlier approved free health care for illegal immigrants. Let’s unspool afresh. Senators including Van de Putte on May 5, 2003, gave voice-vote approval to the proposal, which a May 5, 2003, Senate Journal entry summarized as """"providing health care services without regard to a person's immigration status."""" At the time, Patrick, a talk-radio host, wasn’t yet a senator. The legislation said a city, county or public hospital """"may use money from local sources to provide health care services to a person without regard to the person's immigration status and shall establish a cost-share system for persons receiving health care services."""" At an April 2003 committee hearing, authoring Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, said it permitted hospitals to draw on local revenue to provide preventive services to residents regardless of a patient’s immigration standing. Sylvia Garcia, then a Harris County commissioner, testified the proposal would hasten outpatient services, heading off health problems early and saving money thanks to fewer emergency-room visits. Proponents described the legislation as vital after the then-Texas attorney general (and future U.S. senator), John Cornyn, issued an advisory opinion in July 2001 stating that unless lawmakers allowed the Harris County Hospital District (and others, presumably) to deliver preventive services to patients regardless of immigration status, the district couldn’t give such care without violating the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which required state legislatures to intervene if states wanted hospitals to go ahead and do so. Notably, Cornyn’s letter made it clear some health services already were provided to patients regardless of immigration status--as mandated by federal law. Cornyn’s letter said the district was required by law to provide emergency care to residents regardless of their legal status. Lance Lunsford, spokesman for the Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems statewide, told us a federal law from the 1980s, the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, made free emergency care available to illegal immigrants. According to a federal website, that act required Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical exam when a request is made for an emergency condition, including active labor, regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Cornyn’s letter also said federal law permitted public health services including immunizations and testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases. Still, he wrote, the 1996 law specified that any other state or local health benefit could be provided only if a state law """"affirmatively provides for such eligibility."""" Mike Stafford, the Harris County attorney, reacted to Cornyn’s letter by advising the local hospital district to stop giving discounted preventive care because it violates federal law, according to a July 12, 2001, Associated Press news story. """"It's up to the Texas Legislature to step in now and, if they want to create an exception for this, it's allowable,"""" Stafford said. In 2003, Senate Bill 309 died in the House, though advocates including Lunsford said the permission to provide such services ended up in House Bill 2292, a major 2003 overhaul of health care agencies. Section 285.201 of the Texas Health and Safety code """"affirmatively establishes"""" the eligibility of undocumented residents to receive non-emergency public health benefits funded locally by public hospital districts. And in the end, did the legislation expand free health care for illegal immigrants? When we inquired, King Hillier, a vice president of the Harris County Hospital District, said by phone that """"basically"""" the district had already been providing non-emergency services when the issue reached lawmakers. Hillier stressed the permissive quality of the proposal; funding and delivery of services was left up to local governments. Finally, Hillier noted the Senate version of the law envisioned a system of patients sharing costs, which has resulted, he said. Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte """"voted to give illegal immigrants in this country free health care--not emergency health care but total free health care."""" The 2003 proposal in question didn’t provide immigrants free across-the-board health care. Rather, the measure permitted (and didn’t require) local governing bodies to provide (or, it appears, resume providing) non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, an action that was predicted to improve outcomes and head off costly emergency care to which all residents were already entitled per federal law. Significantly, too, the proposal envisioned patients sharing costs. Diagnosis: . – The statement is not accurate.""",1
"In late May 2018, amid controversies over “zero tolerance” positions on immigration taken by the administration of United States President Donald Trump, social media users began sharing an image of rosaries taken by immigration authorities at the border: Rosaries confiscated from undocumented migrants by US border patrol agents. From a story in the @NewYorker https://t.co/lmVmPzM04f pic.twitter.com/n7iABgKFbY — Michael J. O’Loughlin (@MikeOLoughlin) March 20, 2017  The image went viral amid swelling outrage over the ongoing treatment of migrants in the United States and those seeking refuge and asylum within its borders. In April 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new policy in which the government would pursue criminal charges against any migrant caught making an unauthorized border crossing and take their accompanying children away from them. Since then, readers have been angered by stories of the federal government failing to account for hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children, and reports that hundreds of children — including dozens under age 4 — had been removed from their parents’ care by immigration agents. However, this was not a new image as of 2018. It was taken from a gallery published along with a 12 March 2017 story in The New Yorker and depicts the work of photographer Thomas Kiefer, who used to work as a janitor for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Ajo, Arizona. The rosaries, he explained, were taken from immigrants along with other personal effects when they were arrested by border agents. Kiefer, who quit his CBP job in 2014, fished the unclaimed items out of trash cans as he cleaned. They would later become part of a photography collection he called “El Sueño Americano”: Spending time with the confiscated items — collecting them, curating them, looking at them, photographing them — changed Kiefer’s relationship to his job. Before, he’d been punching the clock so that he could get back to photography; now he felt awakened to hundreds of human dramas playing out around him during each shift. He’d always known, technically, about the C.B.P.’s strict confiscation policies, which were posted on bilingual signs and applied to all items classified as either “non-essential” or “potentially lethal.” But he hadn’t spent much time thinking about these policies, and he hadn’t realized how broadly they were applied, or just how many of the confiscated items — including cell phones and wallets, many still containing I.D.s, prepaid debit cards, and cash — were ending up in the trash, never to be returned. Increasingly, Kiefer felt uncomfortable at work: angry at the system that employed him, sad for the people being “processed,” and afraid that he would be caught making off with government property. But he kept sneaking out what he could, kept building his piles, and kept taking pictures, which at first he showed to no one. CBP spokesman Carlos Diaz told us that items taken away from immigrants upon arrest can be returned if the owner retrieves them — but according to immigrant advocacy organization No More Deaths, many never see their belongings again. According to a 2014 report authored by the organization: The failure to return peoples’ belongings upon deportation represents one more way that ICE and CBP have failed to uphold basic law enforcement standards and human rights norms in their rush to expand the United States’ detention and deportation apparatus. Items taken may include religious effects, but as No More Deaths points out, they include almost anything but the clothing being worn. Generally, personal property is held for 30 days after an arrest and then destroyed. In 2016, David Hill, a volunteer for No More Deaths who is tasked with helping reunite deported migrants with property taken by authorities described to the publication Vice a wide range of confiscated items: “weddings rings, rosaries, and children’s artwork” along with identification cards, money, cell phones and medication: Due to the 30-day rule and the potential for belongings to be lost between agencies involved, immigrants are regularly deported with only the clothes on their back. No cellphones, no ID, no cash. We asked CBP for more detail on their policy on confiscation of personal belongings and how items are returned but did not receive a response.",0
"""The day before the U.S. House of Representatives approved the health care reform bill, Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek, who is running for the U.S. Senate, fired off this accusation about the Republican frontrunner: """"Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all. """"Meek made that statement on his campaign Web site March 20, 2010 -- the day before the historic vote. Here is the full quote: Rubio's """"ideas on health care could jeopardize Medicare and veterans' care, programs which cover more than 5 million Floridians. Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all. That means these programs could be shut down. Moreover, his obstruction of the current health care bill means we could lose our best chance ever to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions and to close the Medicare prescription drug coverage 'donut hole.' That's what he stands for. If he were in the Senate he would lead the charge to scrap health care reform. If elected, he has sworn to do everything he can to repeal it. """"Meek has leveled a sweeping claim that Rubio thinks government should get out of the health care business entirely -- in a state where millions of voters depend on government health care such as Medicare and veterans programs. We know that Rubio is against the Democratic-led health care reform plan that the House approved March 21, but is it fair to say he wants government out of health care entirely?Meek's e-mail cites two sources: an article """"Scrap Obamacare Today"""" written by Rubio on March 15, in Human Events, a conservative publication, and a blog item in The Buzz, a St. Petersburg Times politics blog. Both quote Rubio criticizing the health care proposal. """"The President’s health care proposal is a deeply flawed plan that should be scrapped entirely in favor of a truly bipartisan approach that pursues step-by-step reforms,'' Rubio wrote in Human Events March 15. Meek's campaign also cited a March 3 press release from Rubio in which he spoke against """"government-run health care. """"""""Unfortunately, my opponent [Charlie Crist] disagrees and has said he would not scrap this bill and process. It underscores why, fundamentally, this campaign is about trust. It’s about who Floridians can trust to go to Washington to unapologetically stand on principle against ideas like the stimulus, cap-and-trade and government-run health care,"""" Rubio said in the press release. The Meek campaign's logic is that Rubio's use of """"government-run health care"""" in that paragraph has a broader meaning that indicates he's not just against the Obama reform plan, he's against all government health programs.Meek's campaign also cited Rubio's vote in the Florida House of Representatives April 6, 2006, against a Democratic amendment to an appropriations bill that reduced contract services by $5 million and included funding for a dental program for veterans. The Meek campaign also cited three Rubio votes on the Cover Florida state health care initiative requiring coverage for prenatal care and prostate screening and mammograms. All three amendments, introduced by Democrat Dan Gelber, ultimately failed and Rubio voted against them. Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill. But we find those citations are flimsy evidence for a big, sweeping claim that could alarm Florida voters, particularly senior citizens. In our view it's clear that """"government-run health care"""" was referring to the Obama plan and it doesn't prove that Rubio is against programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.Rubio's campaign also provided us with some evidence that he does believe government has a role in health care:* Rubio wrote an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel Dec. 3, 2009, about the proposed health care bill that indicated he was concerned about cuts in Medicare: """"The bill also would expand a financially unsustainable Medicaid entitlement program that is already straining state budgets. And it would fundamentally hurt Medicare by taking away access to Medicare Advantage plans and installing a new government bureaucracy to oversee Medicare reimbursements. """"* In 2000, Rubio was part of a unanimous vote in favor of hearing screening for newborns and a unanimous vote related to expanding Kidcare, a health program for poor children. In 2004, Rubio voted in favor of changes to Kidcare. He also voted for changes to the Kidcare program in 2004 fought by Democrats because of changes to eligibility requirements.Our own search turned up a few other examples that showed that Rubio has supported certain health care programs or proposals.In a Feb. 19 interview on Morning Joe, Rubio said Medicare """"needs to be reformed,"""" but did not provide details.Rubio supported expanding Florida's controversial Medicaid reform, which was initiated by former Gov. Jeb Bush in an effort to allow private companies to compete to provide serves for the poor, with the hope that it would slow growth in costs.Rubio was quoted in a March 6, 2008, Miami Herald article about the rising costs of Medicaid and the need to save it: """"Florida simply cannot afford to continue doing business like we are currently. In order to save the Medicaid system, continuing reform is vital. Expanding Medicaid Reform into Miami-Dade County is an important step in creating a system that can survive and is a step that we should enact this session. """"In addition, Rubio supported a budget in 2008 that included an estimated $15.7 billion for Medicaid from federal and state sources, according to Florida's Medicaid expenditure estimating conference. Here is a list that shows Medicaid expenditures over several sessions when Rubio was in the House. Someone who believed government """"shouldn't be in the health care business at all"""" wouldn't be supporting Medicaid.Another piece of evidence: A budget list compiled by the governor's office shows Rubio supported money for Jackson Memorial Hospital, a public hospital. """"The budget list also links Rubio to a $20 million special line item for Jackson Memorial Hospital in 2008. Months later, Rubio established a consulting firm with a former aide and scored an $8,000 monthly consulting contract with the hospital,'' the Miami Herald wrote in a March 10 article.The Meek campaign has failed to prove its claim. Rubio clearly has spoken against the federal health care bill, which he has repeatedly referred to as a """"government takeover"""" of health care (a characterization we've repeatedly rated ). But Rubio's votes and his comments indicate he has supported government health programs such as Medicaid. Lambasting a health care reform bill isn't the same as declaring that """"government shouldn't be in the health care business at all.""""""",1
"Andy Rooney, the curmudgeonly commentator who closed every Sunday broadcast of television’s 60 Minutes news magazine with a (typically sardonic) essay about some aspect of everyday life, was — thanks to the Internet — as well-known for what he didn’t say as he was for what he really did say. One compilation of various political observations we previously covered was a prime example of widely-circulated Andy Rooney apocrypha, as was the following example from 2003:  Andy Rooney on Monica:Can you believe it? Monica turned 28 this week. It seems like only yesterday that she was crawling round the White House on her hands and knees. Andy Rooney on Vegetarians: Vegetarian — that’s an old Indian word meaning “lousy hunter.” Andy Rooney on Prisoners: Did you know that it costs forty-thousand dollars a year to house each prisoner? Gee, for forty-thousand bucks apiece, I’ll take a few prisoners into my house. I live in Los Angeles. I already have bars on the windows. I don’t think we should give free room and board to criminals. I think they should have to run twelve hours a day on a treadmill and generate electricity. And if they don’t want to run, they can rest in the chair that’s hooked up to the generator. Andy Rooney on Fabric Softeners: My wife uses fabric softener. I never knew what that stuff was for. Then I noticed women coming up to me, sniffing, then saying under their breath, “Married!” and walking away. Fabric Softeners are how our wives mark their territory. We can take off the ring, but it’s hard to get that April fresh scent out of your clothes. Andy Rooney on Morning Differences: Men and women are different in the morning. We men wake up aroused in the morning. We can’t help it. We just wake up and we want you. And the women are thinking, ‘How can he want me the way I look in the morning?’ It’s because we can’t see you. We have no blood anywhere near our optic nerve. Andy Rooney on Phone-in-Polls: You know those shows where people call in and vote on different issues? Did you ever notice there’s always like 18% “I don’t know”. It costs 90 cents to call up and vote . . . They’re voting “I don’t know.” “Honey, I feel very strongly about this. Give me the phone. (Into phone) I DON’T KNOW! (hangs up, looking proud) Sometimes you have to stand up for what you believe you’re not sure about.” This guy probably calls up phone sex girls for $2.95. (into phone) “I’m not in the mood.” Andy Rooney on Cripes: My wife’s from the midwest. Very nice people there. Very wholesome. They use words like ‘Cripes’ — ‘For Cripes sake.’ Who would that be; Jesus Cripes? The son of ‘Gosh’ of the church of ‘Holy Moly’? I’m not making fun of it. You think I wanna burn in ‘Heck’? Andy Rooney on Grandma: My grandmother has a bumper sticker on her car that says, ‘Sexy Senior Citizen.’ You don’t want to think of your grandmother that way, do you? Out entering wet shawl contests. Makes you wonder where she got that dollar she gave you for your birthday. Andy Rooney on Answering Machines: Did you ever hear one of those corny, positive messages on someone’s answering machine? “Hi! It’s a great day and I’m out enjoying it right now. I hope you are too. The thought for the day is ‘Share the love. '” Beep. “Uh, yeah . . . this is the VD clinic calling . . . Speaking of being positive, your test is back. Stop sharing the love.” There were some quick giveaways that not everything on this list came from the pen of Andy Rooney: making risqué jokes about Monica Lewinsky and “morning arousals” just wasn’t his style; he wouldn’t have written “I live in Los Angeles” since he was a long-time east coast resident; and was well into his 80s at the time this piece began to circulate, so he was not likely to have been speaking of his grandmother in the present tense. (Of course, Mr. Rooney did have a lengthy career as a writer, so some of these items could conceivably have come from his older pieces.) Like most items of this ilk, this list circulated for many years, with new items being added and others dropped off as it trudged from inbox to inbox. The first two entries (about Monica Lewinsky and vegetarians) are common jokes tacked on much later; at other times the list included some or all of the following additional entries:  Award Shows: Can you believe how many award shows they have now? They have awards for commercials. The Cleo Awards. A whole show full of commercials. I taped it and then I fast-forwarded through the whole thing. Pregnancy: It’s weird when pregnant women feel the baby kicking. They say, “Oh my God. He’s kicking. Do you wanna feel it?” I always feel awkward reaching over there. Come on! It’s weird to ask someone to feel your stomach. I don’t do that when I have gas. “Oh my God … give me your hand … It won’t be long now …” Ads in Bills: Have you ever noticed that they put advertisements in with your bills now? Like bills aren’t distasteful enough, they have to stuff junk mail in there with them. I get back at them. I put garbage in with my check when I mail it in. Coffee grinds, banana peels … I write, “Could you throw this away for me? Thank you.” Life Cycle: The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. And what do you get at the end of it? A death. What’s that, a bonus? I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you live in an old age home. You get kicked out when you’re too young, you get a gold watch, then you got to work. You work forty years until you’re young enough to enjoy your retirement. You do drugs, alcohol, you party, get laid, you get ready for high school. You go to grade school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little baby, you go back into the womb, you spend your last nine months floating in warm liquid … and you check out as a gleam in somebody’s eye!",1
"The ceremony harkens back to a time when early Chinese settlers to Taiwan used to pray to mountain gods and local deities for protection against wild animals and other threats. Each new year, the fattened pigs are slaughtered and the carcasses decorated and paraded through the streets of Sanxia, a traditional district in northern Taiwan, to the temple. The owner of the biggest pig wins the competition and with it an auspicious sign that the year to come will be a lucky one. “This is a custom at our Tzu Shih Yeh (founder ancestor) temple in Sanxia. We cannot abolish this tradition,” said Liu Ching-sheng, owner of this year’s winning pig. Animal protection groups say the process of fattening the animals — a pig raised for the ceremony can weigh more than 800 kg (1763 lbs) compared to a normal weight of 120 kg — is cruel. “Just like for us humans, obesity in animals is a disease,” Chen Yu-min, director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan, told Reuters Television. She said the pigs’ movements are restricted while they are fattened and the additional weight puts a strain on their internal organs. “In addition to the inhumane process of fattening is the last moment when they are about to be slaughtered. This moment is actually very cruel and inhumane,” she said.",0
"On July 17 2019, a Facebook user shared a post (archived here), claiming an image of a map plotted the locations of “reported cases of flesh eating bacteria” that summer.In the status update, the user wrote:I will no longer be going to the beach or on the sand. *There also asking woman not to shave there legs for 2 days before they go to the beach because if u have any type of cut u will get it.A lady got it just on the sand.This stuff is Horrible!A number of people responded with similar vows to avoid beaches based on the alarming map.We searched to see if the map originated with any news stories about dangerous levels of “flesh eating bacteria” at Gulf Coast beaches, and found versions of the same map shared as early as 2010. Both TinEye and Google Image Search returned a mixture of results.However, earlier iterations of the map were attached to content related to a British Petroleum oil spill in April 2010. Google suggested “flesh eating bacteria Florida 2017 map” as a name for the image, indicating that the map was mislabeled as early as 2017:It is true that some counties in Florida have experienced an uptick in cases of an illness mislabeled as “flesh-eating disease,” and public health officials attributed the infections to water pollution:Vibrio vulnificus infections aren’t the type of thing the region’s paradise promoters necessarily want to talk about, yet there were more potentially deadly cases documented in Lee and Collier counties last year than anywhere else in Florida.It’s commonly called flesh-eating disease, a not-quite-accurate nickname that makes public health officials cringe, because the microbes that cause it don’t really eat people; the toxins they produce can destroy soft tissue, and, in serious cases, cause death. Symptoms after contact include: chills, fever, swelling, blistering, skin lesions, severe pain, low blood pressure and discharge from wound. Without treatment, death can occur in just a few days.Since 2008, Vibrio vulnificus has infected 346 people in Florida, killing 99 — more than 28 percent of those who contracted the disease. Last year, the bacteria infected 49 people in Florida, killing 11 of them, which is one more death and three more infections over 2016.However, officials also noted that the risk of infection remains extremely rare for most people:Even though the chance of getting a Vibrio infection is about the same as getting hit by lightning, some environmental advocates worry it might become even more common if water pollution isn’t curbed.The Facebook map indicated numerous cases of the illness ranging from Florida’s coasts across to Texas, including Louisiana. On August 1 2019, People reported on the grand total of cases in the United States that year:Of the reported cases [in 2019], seven occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, where flesh-eating bacteria, especially the vibrio species, have thrived for years because of the year-round warm waters. In April, a man fishing in Ozona, Florida, contracted the bacteria. Two months later, the same thing happened to a 12-year-old girl vacationing in Destin, Florida. Just a few days later, a 77-year-old woman died after walking along Coquina Beach on Anna Maria Island in the same state.After the Fourth of July weekend, five people developed flesh-eating bacteria — a man in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, a woman in California, and two men who died from necrotizing fasciitis, one in Okaloosa County, Florida and another on Magnolia Beach in Texas.Cases from other areas include one in Waterloo, Alabama, along the Tennessee River, another at Ocean View Beach near Norfolk, Virginia, one at Colonial Beach in Virginia, on the Potomac River, one on Ocean City, Maryland’s bay side and another from the Green River in Kentucky.The “reported cases of flesh eating bacteria” map spreading in 2019 was a map created in 2010 in relation to the BP oil spill. Cases of the bacterial infections were reported across the United States, but they were far fewer in number than the map suggested. Officials indicated that chances of contracting an infection from the water for most people remain very low.",1
"The panel voted 10-1 in favor of the drug, which would, if approved, be sold under the brand name Zontivity. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. Results from a trial known as TRA 2P were “robust,” panelists said, and justified approval for patients who had suffered a heart attack. They agreed with the company that the drug should not be used in patients with a history of stroke, since there was an increased risk of bleeding in the brain in this group of patients. “I think this drug addresses a real unmet medical need,” said Dr. Philip Sager, consulting professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. The vote followed a positive analysis by reviewers for the FDA, whose report, published on Monday, also recommended the drug be approved. Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells, or platelets, from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks. Other anti-platelets include aspirin and Plavix, which is made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Merck’s drug works in a different way, by inhibiting a receptor known as PAR-1. The drug increased the overall risk of bleeding in clinical trials, though the risk in patients who had not had a stroke did not outweigh the drug’s benefit, panelists said. Still, Dr. Sanjay Kaul, a cardiologist and professor at UCLA School of Medicine who voted in favor of approval, urged the FDA to “do its due diligence” around the bleeding risk. Each year about 190,000 Americans have a second heart-related event, according to Merck. Standard therapy to prevent a second episode often includes treatment with aspirin and Plavix. Vorapaxar would be given in addition to standard treatment. “The results of today’s advisory committee mark an important milestone in our effort to bring vorapaxar to appropriate patients with a history of heart attack,” Dr. Daniel Bloomfield, who leads Merck’s cardiovascular research, said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the FDA as it completes its review.”  Merck has proposed that the drug’s label urge caution when prescribing the drug for patients who weigh less than 60 kilograms (132 lbs) since the risk of bleeding in these patients appears to be higher than in heavier patients. Panelists could not reach a consensus recommendation on how lower-weight patients should be treated. Representatives from the FDA said they will continue to discuss the matter before making their final ruling.",0
"The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (known as WIC for short), a federal program that provides nutritional assistance to malnourished mothers and children, was enacted in 1972 as an amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Initially funded as a two-year pilot program, WIC was permanently reauthorized by Congress in 1975 and today offers federal grants to states for “supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk.” The program is administrated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Impetus for the legislation is usually credited to an accumulating body of research in the 1960s identifying hunger and malnutrition as a major national problem. A 1969 report by the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health concluded that hunger and poverty existed on a “disgraceful scale” across the United States, and urged the federal government to take immediate action to close the “hunger gap” among poorer Americans. After some pilot programs launched by the Nixon administration failed to produce the desired results, a bill containing the WIC amendment and improvements to existing school nutrition programs was passed by Congress in 1972. There is an alternative account of how WIC came about, however. According to this narrative,  the program grew out of (or was at least inspired by) organized efforts by the Black Panther Party (BPP) to help feed single mothers and their children in predominantly African-American communities in the late 1960s. Here it is in meme form, as posted in February 2017 recognition of Black History Month: Black Panthers Women Infant & Child – #BlackHistoryMonth –> https://t.co/ySsVWT2Jwo pic.twitter.com/ihT5riFDiK — AFROPUNK (@afropunk) February 13, 2017  One also finds the claim repeated on web sites such as Counter Current News and Urban Intellectuals, who cite as evidence a list of 65 community programs allegedly created by the Black Panthers during their heyday, including a “WIC (Women Infants, and Children) Program.” But though it’s easily corroborated that the Panthers launched a community food program in 1968 called Free Breakfast for Children, an effort some believe provided inspiration for the federal government’s school breakfast program (if not for WIC itself), we could find no evidence that the Panthers ever operated a program called WIC, or which bore any close resemblance to the USDA program. The roll-out of the Free Breakfast for Children program marked a turning point, however short-lived, in the Black Panthers’ public image. From its inception as an armed, revolutionary organization in 1966 (J. Edgar Hoover called BPP “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country”), press coverage of the Panthers was overwhelmingly negative, focusing exclusively on their militant rhetoric and violent confrontations with police. The breakfast program provided the opportunity to show a kinder, gentler side of the party, albeit still fraught with revolutionary politics. The New York Times reported in June 1969: In the Bay Area, every chapter of the Black Panther Party is involved in providing free breakfasts for children. The project involves at least six cities in the state. “Right now,” Bobby Seale, chairman and co-founder of the party said last week, “we are feeding over 1,000 kids every day right here in the Bay Area.” Seale added that the program, which was also operating in New York, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Los Angeles, Kansas City and other major cities, feeds 10,000 children daily. […] In addition to what they can collect at the rallies and demonstrations, the Panthers also make the rounds of business establishments in the area. Their demand that merchants doing business in the black communities make contributions is firm. One large supermarket, Safeway, is now the target of a Panther-led boycott because, according to Seale, it refused to contribute $100 a week to the breakfast program. While the Panthers say that the program was initiated “to feed hungry children,” they make no effort to mask its political side. Most of the church basements and halls where the breakfasts are served have huge posters and pictures of Black Panther leaders and heroes of the black nationalist movement pasted on the walls. The “Free Huey” shouts are almost constant. “Free Huey” is a Panther slogan that refers to Huey Newton, one of the founders of the organization and its minister of defense who was jailed last year after a manslaughter conviction arising from the fatal shooting of an Oakland policeman. That it was partly a public relations effort doesn’t change the fact that the Panthers were providing a sorely needed service to impoverished children which could very well have provided the impetus for the federal government to step in. There is no doubt, moreover, that members of Congress charged with solving America’s hunger problem were aware of the free breakfast program. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs in May 1969, California legislator Jesse Unruh said, “The Black Panthers are supplying more free breakfasts to California school children than the federal government does.” It was intended (and no doubt heard) as a wake-up call. Still, it’s hard to make the case that the Panthers’ program served as an exact prototype for Sen. Hubert Humphrey’s WIC legislation, which was still three years away from being introduced in Congress. There were few real similarities between the programs. Although the Panthers launched other initiatives (including free medical clinics) to help people in various communities, the free breakfasts were for children alone. As its name implies, the federal government’s Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children was much broader in scope. Plus, it had nothing to do with serving breakfast. There was a separate USDA program for that. The federal School Breakfast Program was established under the Child Nutrition Act in 1966, and it had already been in operation for three years by the time the Black Panther Party instituted its community-based programs. That’s not to say that school breakfasts were an unqualified success, however. Partly because it met with political resistance and funding constraints, it took years for the federal program to ramp up to the point where it even came close to meeting the needs of the population it was meant to help. The Panthers helped expose the many shortcomings of that and other government food assistance programs. Historian Susan Levine, author of School Lunch Politics: The Surprising History of America’s Favorite Welfare Program, gives the Panthers their due in that regard, but noted in an interview with Eater.com that lobbying groups such as the Committee on School Lunch Participation likely had a greater effect on federal policy: “The Panthers were part of the general context in the late 1960s,” Levine says. “But I think CSLP was probably more specifically influential, because they actually went to Congress and testified, and their report got a lot of attention in the wake of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s death.”",1
"On September 20 2019, a Facebook page shared the following screenshot of a purported headline: “Man suffers heart attack, dies at work, coworkers gather for group selﬁe thinking he’d fallen asleep”:In an appended status update, the page just commented “BRUH,” and no links to any related article were included. A search for the elusive headline turned up an iFunny.co post published on the same day as the Facebook status above.If the original headline (“Man suffers heart attack, dies at work, coworkers gather for group selﬁe thinking he’d fallen asleep”) ever existed, it didn’t return any search results and was likely quite old.But the attached image was a different story. On February 2 2016, it was shared to Reddit’s photoshopping subreddit r/PSBattles, with a title encouraging users to creatively edit “this man sleeping in the office in front of his co-workers”:PsBattle: This man sleeping in the office in front of his colleagues. from photoshopbattlesOn the same day, the same image appeared on Reddit’s r/TIFU (“Today I Fucked Up“), but that post has since been deleted:TIFU by falling asleep at the job on my second day from tifuOn February 3 2016, the Huffington Post covered what was at the time a viral news sensation. Two days later, CBC identified the sleeping man as an intern in Montreal, Canada:A Montreal intern woke up to a burst of laughter on his second day at a new job Tuesday after his co-workers had gathered around to take a now viral photo of him – with his mouth wide open, asleep at his desk.Eduard Paraschivescu has been undergoing training at a company called Gsoft that afternoon. He has a slight anemia, so when he felt tired, he leaned back in his chair and about 20 minutes later he realized he’d dozed off.One of the reasons he knew this was because his co-workers were around him when he woke up, laughing, and taking pictures and videos.He also found a message saying he should bring in doughnuts in the next day. He said he did, and that he hasn’t lost his job.But it was Paraschivescu himself who took the extra step of posting a photo on Reddit, where it was picked up by the PhotoshopBattles subreddit.A “Man suffers heart attack, dies at work, coworkers gather for group selﬁe thinking he’d fallen asleep” headline screenshot offers an object lesson in a common trajectory for “fake news” items and how they come to be. At some point in time, someone paired the viral “sleeping intern” photograph from 2016 with an outlandish and untrue headline reflecting an old urban legend about an office worker who had once remained dead and unnoticed at their desk for five days.In 2000 and 2001, that similar (and also false) claim circulated, reflective of fears that we are quite literally only “warm bodies” to employers — so much so that desk deaths could conceivably have no effect on whether our workplaces carry on without us. Its previous virality showed that the image itself is eye-catching and shareable, more so when paired with a compelling headline. However, a quick image search showed that the original photograph moved from one subreddit to another before becoming a viral hit on its own in 2016.",1
"Swiss police said on Friday that they stormed the home of the 54-year-old man, who had barricaded himself inside, was armed with a knife and had issued repeated threats. An unidentified woman with him was also arrested. The man had been free on bail since August. His trial began on March 6, but he stopped turning up in court on Thursday. The case came to the attention of the Swiss authorities after an HIV-positive patient told a Berne hospital he had traced his infection back to acupuncture treatments carried out by the accused.

"Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of “faked” NASA data designed to “fit a climate change narrative.” Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested: In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward. There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to “uncover” betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review. The “smoking gun” concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides “a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.” To argue for evidence of “faked” data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:  (These charts plot how far off each year’s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951–1980; the frame labeled “a” is from 1999.) It should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places. Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies’ climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an “unadjusted global temperature record” — which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number — is not really a thing that exists to begin with: There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that … there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate. Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements. So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA’s GISTEMP website, “Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.” The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a “climate change narrative.” These “non-climatic biases” include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA’s website. They included: Additionally, post-1999 GISTEMP records employ models to fill in areas with missing data to make a more complete record from a spatial perspective. The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments. All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records. The largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºC",1
"""Are loosies a terrorist revenue stream? State Rep. Rick Saccone thinks so. During a session ahead of a vote on the state budget’s revenue package last week, Saccone, a Republican from Allegheny County, objected to a proposed $1-per-pack cigarette tax increase Wednesday. The new tax, which Governor Wolf signed into law later that day, raises the state’s levy to $2.60 per pack. Saccone viewed this as earning revenue off the backs of the poor, but also he was wary that price hikes might encourage smuggling rings that send money to violent extremists. """"We as a legislature are not only ready to trample on the poor, who disproportionately bear the burden of that tax,"""" he told the body, """"we’re prepared to disregard the ugly consequence that driving the price too high nurtures illegal tobacco sales, which have been connected to funding terrorism against us. I’ll say that again, folks: Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half."""" Saccone wasn’t the only representative to raise such concerns. """"Interstate 81 is a smuggler’s alley. Now Pennsylvania will be a stop on Smuggler’s Alley,"""" State Rep. Russ Diamond, a Republican from Lebanon County, said earlier in his remarks. """"And what kind of folks are in the cigarette smuggling business and what else do they do with their money? Are they also involved in other illegal activities? Are they involved in human trafficking? Are they funding Hezbollah or ISIS? We don’t know."""" Later, in an interview with PolitiFact PA, Saccone pointed to a noteworthy 2015 State Department report, """"The Global Illicit Trade in Tobacco: A Threat to National Security."""" """"Internationally, it fuels transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism,"""" the report’s authors wrote. """"The illicit trade in tobacco products remains a lucrative revenue stream for many criminal actors and illicit networks."""" Is it fair to consider price hikes drivers? David Merriman, a University of Chicago researcher who studies how consumers react to cigarette taxes, said in an email, """"There is high quality scientific evidence that relatively high cigarette taxes/prices are associated with increased illicit sales."""" Saccone said the while many details may be classified, the links from reported probes are clear. """"We know that these terrorist organizations are branching out and they’re using multiple activities to fund their operations, especially in foreign countries,"""" he said. """"I’m not saying the sale of cigarettes is the only source… but we know we can tie, according to these government reports and some of these operations, at least some of cigarette smuggling to the funding of terrorism."""" Many of the examples in the State Department report, and many of the examples we found through broader research, were not domestic. One-eyed Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, also known as the """"Marlboro Man,"""" has entered the realm of legend not only for his prowess as a cigarette smuggler across Northern Africa, but also because U.S. intelligence has yet to confirm whether he’s actually dead or not. In 2004, an anti-terrorism law passed that prohibits importing missiles made specifically to blow up planes. The first person convicted under this law was Yi Qing Chen, a top smuggler in a Chinese crime ring that was busted in two connected probes: Operation Smoking Dragon and Operation Royal Charm, the latter being a FBI-staged yacht wedding where the lucky couple were actually undercover agents, and the suspects were invited guests. Chen, who was the arrested in Operation Smoking Dragon, had smuggled counterfeit money, military-grade weapons, methamphetamines, cigarettes and missiles, among other items. It’s not extraordinary to say that internationally, organized crime rings have developed far-reaching black market networks, illicit cigarettes being one of the industries. But how common is the case Saccone described— a black market growing thanks to the higher cigarette prices found in a particular state, and that market funnelling money to violent extremists? According to Understanding the U.S. Illicit Tobacco Market: Characteristics, Policy Context, and Lessons from International Experiences, 226-page National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study, not that common: """"Overall, given the total number of terrorism-related tobacco investigations in the United States (keeping in mind that smuggling cases are likely to receive priority if they can be linked to terrorism), as well as the dollar amounts involved in those cases, the link between the U.S. illicit tobacco market and terrorism appears to be minor."""" From the 2002 and 2003 fiscal years, the report states, out of nearly 300 tobacco cases at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), only eight were """"linked to terrorism."""" As the report notes, the underground market evades a good deal of statistical reporting. And while many investigations may look at both terrorist affiliations and illicit tobacco, both charges don’t always stick. Take the Knoxville man who pleaded guilty to cigarette smuggling in 2010. The FBI began investigating him after wiretapping conversations in which he seemed like an Al Qaeda recruiter. According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, the terror charge fell to the wayside after a lie-detector test backed his explanation: that on the phone calls, he was merely kidding. We reached out to ATF for cases that had led to convictions on both counts. ATF pointed to the 25 indictments resulting from Operation Smokescreen, which focused on an interstate cigarette smuggling ring. This group of illegal tobacco traders in North Carolina and Michigan operated primarily in the late ’90s, led to multiple arrests and convictions for cigarette smuggling and assisting Hezbollah. (One of the men, according to the Village Voice, donated $3,500 to the combatant group.) Arrests were made from 2000 to 2002. We found another example. Reportedly, a cigarette smuggler helped the Lackawanna Six, a group of Yemeni-American friends who were Al-Qaeda trainees, finance their trip to training camp in Afghanistan. Some of the men allegedly had smuggled cigarettes themselves. They were arrested in 2002, the magic number in both investigations -- which means 15 years is not out of the realm of possibility. These are the most high-profile examples of domestic cigarette smuggling connected to terrorism financing post-2001. We weren’t able to find more recent cases. """"[T]here is also no systematic evidence of sustained links between the global illicit tobacco trade and terrorism,"""" according to the report. Our ruling Rep. Saccone said in a house session, """"Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half."""" Most of the trouble with this statement are its implications: American cigarette smuggling does not have strong presence in terrorism financing. Saccone himself admitted that he had heard of no such incidence in Philadelphia, where a cigarette tax bumped prices up in 2014. But, there have been cases, as he mentioned. In our research and from our correspondence with ATF, we were only able to find two groups that had financed terrorist activities through illicit tobacco sale, the Lackawanna Six and an interstate North Carolina-Michigan smuggling ring, both leading to multiple convictions.""",0
"""As evidence that the country is closer to socialist than capitalist these days, radio and talk show host Glenn Beck recently made this claim about John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: """"I mean, we've got czars now,"""" Beck said during his July 22, 2009, program. """"Czars like John Holdren, who has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population."""" Political figures like Holdren, who are little-known by most Americans, make easy targets. And Beck's biting quick hit on Holdren provides a healthy enough dose of outrage on which to hang his argument. But is it true? Beck's allegation has its roots in a book Holdren co-authored with Paul and Annie Ehrlich more than three decades ago called  Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment  . Conservative bloggers have quoted the book extensively, and often out of context, to make the point that Holdren has advocated positions such as the ones Beck stated. We obtained the book to see exactly what Holdren, then a young man, wrote (or co-wrote). The book is just over 1,000 pages, and it clearly makes that case that an explosion in population presented a grave crisis. Although it is a textbook, the authors don't shy away from presenting a point of view. As the preface states, """"We have tried throughout the book to state clearly where we stand on various matters of controversy."""" In a section on """"Involuntary Fertility Control,"""" Holdren and the other authors discuss various """"coercive"""" means of population control — including putting sterilants in the drinking water. But they stop well short of advocating such measures. Here's a few excerpts: """"The third approach to population limitation is that of involuntary fertility control. Several coercive proposals deserve discussion, mainly because some countries may ultimately have to resort to them unless current trends in birth rates are rapidly reversed by other means. ...  """"Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods is a suggestion that seems to horrify people more than most proposals for involuntary fertility control. Indeed, this would pose some very difficult political, legal, and social questions, to say nothing of the technical problems. No such sterilant exists today, nor does one appear to be under development. To be acceptable, such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements: it must be uniformly effective, despite widely varying doses received by individuals, and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex, children, old people, pets, or livestock. ...  """"Again, there is no sign of such an agent on the horizon. And the risk of serious, unforeseen side effects would, in our opinion, militate against the use of any such agent, even though this plan has the advantage of avoiding the need for socioeconomic pressures that might tend to discriminate against particular groups or penalize children."""" Later, the authors conclude, """"Most of the population control measures beyond family planning discussed above have never been tried. Some are as yet technically impossible and others are and probably will remain unacceptable to most societies (although, of course, the potential effectiveness of those least acceptable measures may be great). """"Compulsory control of family size is an unpalatable idea, but the alternatives may be much more horrifying. As those alternatives become clearer to an increasing number of people in the 1980s, they may begin demanding such control. A far better choice, in our view, is to expand the use of milder methods of influencing family size preferences, while redoubling efforts to ensure that the means of birth control, including abortion and sterilization, are accessible to every human being on Earth within the shortest possible time. If effective action is taken promptly against population growth, perhaps the need for the more extreme involuntary or repressive measures can be averted in most countries."""" And here's the part that some have interpreted as Holdren advocating for forced abortions. """"To date, there has been no serious attempt in Western countries to use laws to control excessive population growth, although there exists ample authority under which population growth could be regulated. For example, under the United States Constitution, effective population-control programs could be enacted under the clauses that empower Congress to appropriate funds to provide for the general welfare and to regulate commerce, or under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such laws constitutionally could be very broad. Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society. Few today consider the situation in the United States serious enough to justify compulsion, however."""" This comes in a section discussing population law. The authors argue that compulsory abortions could potentially be allowed under U.S. law """"if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society."""" Again, that's a far cry from advocating or proposing such a position. In the book, the authors certainly advocate making abortions readily accessible for women who want to get them. But they never advocate forced abortions. Big difference. In response to the comments from Beck and others, Holdren's office issued this statement: """"The quotations used to suggest that Dr. Holdren supports coercive approaches to limiting population growth were taken from a 1977 college textbook on environmental science and policy, of which he was the third author. The quoted material was from a section of the book that described different possible approaches to limiting population growth and then concluded that the authors’ own preference was to employ the noncoercive approaches before the environmental and social impacts of overpopulation led desperate societies to employ coercive ones. Dr. Holdren has never been an advocate of compulsory abortions or other repressive means of population limitation."""" Holdren's office also provided a statement from Annie and Paul Ehrlich, the co-authors: """"We have been shocked at the serious mischaracterization of our views and those of John Holdren in blog posts based on misreadings of our jointly-authored 1000-page 1977 textbook, ECOSCIENCE. We were not then,  never have been, and are not now 'advocates' of the Draconian measures for population limitation described — but not recommended — in the book's 60-plus small-type pages cataloging the full spectrum of population policies that, at the time, had either been tried in some country or analyzed by some commentator. Under questioning by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., during his Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he """"no longer thinks it's productive to focus on optimum population for the United States. ... I think the key thing today is that we need to work to improve the conditions that all of our citizens face economically, environmentally, and in other respects. And we need to aim for something that I have for years been calling 'sustainable prosperity.'"""" Vitter continued with his line of question, asking directly, """"Do you think determining optimal population is a proper role of government?"""" Said Holdren: """"No, senator, I do not. ... I think the proper role of government is to develop and deploy the policies with respect to economy, environment, security, that will ensure the well-being of the citizens we have."""" But with regard to Beck's claim that Holdren """"has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population,"""" the text of the book clearly does not support that. We think a thorough reading shows that these were ideas presented as approaches that had been discussed. They were not posed as suggestions or proposals. In fact, the authors make clear that they did not support coercive means of population control. Certainly, nowhere in the book do the authors advocate for forced abortions. Some have argued that Holdren's view of the imminent and grave global dangers posed by overpopulation should provide pause, given Holdren's current view that global warming now presents imminent and grave global dangers. That's a matter for reasoned debate. But in seeking to score points for a political argument, Beck seriously mischaracterizes Holdren's positions. Holdren didn't advocate those ideas then. And, when asked at a Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he did not support them now. We think it's irresponsible to pluck a few lines from a 1,000-page, 30-year-old textbook, and then present them out of context to dismiss Holdren's long and distinguished career.""",1
"Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective treatment in melanoma but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) had initially blocked its use in lung cancer. “If companies work with us to price drugs reasonably and manage any uncertainties in the evidence base, we can continue to recommend patients have routine access to the treatments they need,” Carole Longson, director of the NICE centre for health technology evaluation, said in a statement on Friday.

"Demand for plant-based foods is growing fast as consumers worried about the environmental impact of meat production and keen to avoid a meat-heavy diet on health grounds look for alternative protein sources. JUST’s products including JUST Egg, a scrambled egg imitation made from mung beans, are available in the United States, Canada, China and Singapore, with sales evenly split between retailers including Walmart (WMT.N), Safeway and Whole Foods (AMZN.O), and restaurants such as Tim Hortons (QSR.TO). Chief Executive Josh Tetrick said cutting the costs of JUST Egg was key to broader acceptance. It is “really important for us to become one of the lowest cost proteins on the planet,” he said. “Today, our cost is 22 cents per serving. Our goal is to get to 12 cents next year and then ultimately below five.”  The cheapest supermarket eggs from non-caged hens cost around 16 cents each. Tetrick told Reuters that after launching in Europe a next logical step is achieving profitability, in advance of a possible listing to raise money. He has already raised about $250 million from investors around the world, including Mitsui, Temasek, China Construction Bank, Founders Fund, the Benioff family and the Heineken family. Tetrick, whose company employs about 120 people, sees his JUST Egg in European outlets in the next few months. “We will be launching in some locations, retailers and restaurants in Europe,” he said on the sidelines of an event in Zurich last week. Investors are taking notice of the growth in plant-based foods. U.S. startup Beyond Meat’s (BYND.O) stock has nearly tripled since it went public in May even though it is yet to turn a profit. Tetrick said his San Francisco-based company had hired longtime food industry executive Dave Wagstaff, with experience at global giants like McCain and free-range egg brand Happy Egg, to head its European team. “Our partners in Europe today include (Italian egg company) Eurovo, they’re doing the manufacturing and distribution, as well as German poultry group PHW and (online food delivery platform) Delivery Hero (DHER.DE).”  Tetrick said he was confident the company could get a slice of the $260 billion global egg market “if we get it right”. “We figured out the technology, but now we have to execute.”  Tetrick said the company was expecting low- to mid-double- digit million dollar revenues this year and should multiply sales by around seven next year. “Our most important financial objective is operating profitability,” he said. “We’ll get there some time in the next year.”",0
"According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most prevalent flu strain this season is H1N1 - the same strain that caused the 2009 pandemic and afflicts otherwise healthy children and young adults. Flu is now widespread in 35 states, according to the CDC. Rates are particularly high in 13 states, mostly in the South and Southwest: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. “The trend of low vaccination rates among younger adults is particularly troubling this year, when they are more at risk than usual for the effects of the H1N1 strain of flu that’s circulating,” said Jeffrey Levi, executive director of Trust for America’s Health, the nonprofit health advocacy group that released the latest findings. The analysis found that overall, 45 percent of all Americans got a flu shot during the 2012-13 season, the most recent period for which full season data are available. That was up slightly from 41.8 percent in the 2011-12 season. But among U.S. adults aged 18-64, only 35.7 percent got a flu shot during the 2012-2013 flu season. That compared with 56.6 percent of children age 6 months to 17 years, and 66.2 percent of seniors 65 and older who were vaccinated during 2012-2013. Among U.S. states, vaccination rates were highest last season in Massachusetts at 57.5 percent, and lowest in Florida at 34.1 percent. Only 12 states had vaccination rates of 50 percent or higher: Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Tennessee. The CDC recommends all American 6 months and older get vaccinated each year.",0
"On 18 March 2017, the author of a blog called “Mountains and Mustard Seeds” published a post about her personal experience with serious medical complications caused by a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. These drugs include: That post (headlined “This Antibiotic Will Ruin You”) highlights somewhat recent announcements made by the FDA requiring new warning labels and suggested limitations on their use: The antibiotics you took or are taking for your sinus infection, UTI, skin infection, laser eye surgery…ect [sic]…may have already damaged you. Cipro, Levaquin, Avalox, nearly every generic ending in “quin”, “oxacin,””ox,”…are all part of a large family of antibiotics called “Fluoroquinolones.” The FDA finally updated their warning on these antibiotics as of July 2016. They cite “multiple system damage that may be irreversible.” Permanent you guys. […]  In 2010, I took Cipro for a UTI and it changed my life forever. A round of antibiotics literally changed the path I was walking, into a path that I couldn’t even crawl on. Multiple spontaneous tendon and ligament ruptures, spinal degeneration, and arthritis that is widespread. We are talking multiple joint dislocations and surgeries to most of my large joints and spine. Twenty surgeries in the last 7 years if you wanna count. While our post does not seek to verify the author’s personal story, the information presented regarding documented complications from this class of antibiotics is factual. The Food and Drug Administration, since July 2008, has issued a series of increasingly strong notices regarding the rare (but serious) risk of tendon rupture, tendonitis, and neurologic damage resulting in pain or numbness. These alerts culminated in a revised “Boxed Warning” and new prescribing recommendations, as described in a 26 July 2016 FDA safety announcement:  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved changes to the labels of fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs for systemic use (i.e., taken by mouth or by injection). These medicines are associated with disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system that can occur together in the same patient. As a result, we revised the Boxed Warning, FDA’s strongest warning, to address these serious safety issues. We also added a new warning and updated other parts of the drug label, including the patient Medication Guide. As a 2015 review of adverse effects from fluoroquinolone antibiotics explained, the class of drugs has a long history of use for a broad range of conditions, and uses a unique mechanism that actively destroys bacterial DNA: Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics were first approved by the FDA for marketing in the 1980s. Since then, FQs have been used extensively to treat a wide range of infections and, although not approved by the FDA for prevention, are also increasingly used as prophylaxis against infection among persons with cancer and other immune compromised states. That same report, which used data collected by the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to demonstrate the reality of these risks, stated that while the exact mechanism by which fluoroquinolones may contribute to tendon damage is unclear, it does likely involve mitochondrial damage as described in the Mountains and Mustard Seed post: The mechanism by which [Fluoroquinolones or FQs] cause tendon injury is unclear. […] FQs cause oxidative stress in tenocyte cells through overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This overproduction has direct toxic effects in the extracellular matrix. In addition, FQs cause mitochondrial toxicity and apoptosis. In other words, the drugs cause damage to, and sometimes kill, tendon cells by overproducing oxygen-containing chemicals, and can also harm a cells vital mitochondrial DNA. To be clear, the risks are still somewhat rare. Depending on which drug is used and what studies you base your analysis on, tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, though experts agree the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. According to multiple studies, these risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and especially patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids, which are used to treat inflammation, among other things. Because of the potentially permanent and disabling effect of these risks, the FDA argues, the risk-to-benefit ratio has shifted enough to merit limiting their prescription to cases of absolute necessity, per their July 2016 notice: We have determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients who have no other treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis, (ABS), acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), and uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) because the risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits in these patients. For some serious bacterial infections the benefits of fluoroquinolones outweigh the risks, and it is appropriate for them to remain available as a therapeutic option. The author of the “Mountains and Mustard Seeds” post also alluded to potential psychiatric complications: Fluoroquinolones cross the blood brain barrier. This can result in psychiatric events, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I was incredibly fortunate not to have the psychiatric side of this. This, too, is accurate, although the recent changes to FDA warnings were not spurred by any new incidents or developments regarding mental health events. A 2003 study using data collected by the Italian government estimated that psychiatric effects from fluoroquinolones occur in about 1.8 percent of cases, with a majority of those cases being minor and self-resolving.",0
"""Across the country and around the world, pundits are saying Gov. Bob McDonnell performed a career-defining flip-flop Wednesday by urging fellow Republicans in the General Assembly to ease legislation mandating ultrasounds before an abortion. The Guardian in London called it a """"U-Turn;"""" Al Sharpton on """"PoliticsNation"""" called it a """"huge turn-around;"""" Slate called it a """"backtrack."""" Politico wrote: """"The conservative blogosphere collectively bemoaned Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s decision to withdraw his support for legislation requiring invasive ultrasounds to be performed before abortions."""" The narrative, in many of the stories, is that McDonnell’s action will harm his chances to become the vice-presidential candidate on the Republican national ticket this year. So we wheeled out our Flip-O-Meter to see if McDonnell really did change his position in the ultrasound controversy. On the morning of Jan. 31, during an interview on WTOP radio, McDonnell announced his support of legislation requiring physicians, before an performing an abortion, to conduct an ultrasound and present the image of the fetus to the mother. Here’s an excerpt from his talk with broadcaster Mark Segraves:  Segraves: """"But what do you support – the idea of having a woman have to take a sonogram before getting an abortion? Is that something you would support?"""" McDonnell: """"An ultrasound – yes, I actually was the original sponsor of that bill about 10 years ago, to give a woman the right to know all the information before she makes the choice."""" Segraves: """"Well, giving her the right to know and mandating a procedure are two completely different things."""" McDonnell: """"Yeah, but I think it gives full information – an ultrasound is used – it’s modern technology, the costs have been driven down, to be able to have that  information before making, what most people say is a very important, serious, life-changing decision, I think, is appropriate."""" McDonnell didn’t get into the types of ultrasounds or the details of the bill. And the legislation did not specify any type of sonogram that must be performed. Several hours later, debate on the Senate floor cast the bill in a new light. Several Democrats,  for the first time, argued that the common """"jelly on the belly"""" abdominal sonogram -- in which a wand is rubbed over a woman’s stomach -- may not be sensitive enough to render the image of a fetus in the first months of pregnancy. In such cases, they said, the abortion law would require physicians to conduct invasive transvaginal ultrasounds -- even against a mother’s will -- to get an image. The first news account disclosing that the bill would require transvaginal ultrasounds ran on Feb. 3. After that, the story went viral. The bill, which critics called """"state-sanctioned rape,"""" earned the ridicule from Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live. More than 1,000 people protested at the state Capitol on Feb. 21. Then, on Feb. 22, McDonnell urged the Republican-controlled General Assembly to amend the bill so that no woman would be required to have a transvaginal ultrasound. In a written statement, the governor said he had been initially unaware that the legislation would require the invasive procedure. """"I have come to understand that the medical practice and standard of care currently guide physicians to use other procedures to find the gestational age of the child, when abdominal ultrasounds cannot do so,"""" McDonnell wrote. The House amended the bill as the governor requested. The measure is pending in the Senate. So, is there any evidence McDonnell reversed himself on mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds before an abortion? The answer is no. The governor, on Jan. 31, endorsed the general concept of mandating ultrasounds before abortions. Hours later, several senate Democrats revealed the legislation would require some use of transvaginal ultrasounds, even against a woman’s will. There is no record that McDonnell ever endorsed or defended mandatory use of the invasive procedure. Did McDonnell alter his long-held support for requiring women to undergo a non-invasive, external ultrasound before an abortion? The answer, again, is no. He still backs that. Despite all the uproar, we cannot find any change in McDonnell’s stance.""",0
"""As U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., weighs a potential presidential bid in 2016, a long list of politicians are considering whether to run for his Senate seat. That includes U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, according to a Politico report on Feb. 17. (She’s not a lock on the Democratic side. A Tampa Bay Times Florida Insider Poll suggests U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Palm Beach County and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham of Leon County could also be strong contenders.) One group was quick to attack Wasserman Schultz’s potential candidacy: The pro-pot lobby. Last year, she opposed Florida’s medical marijuana ballot initiative, which received almost 58 percent support, two points shy of passage. She also voted against a congressional amendment supported by advocates for medical marijuana. """"She’s voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison. And we’re certainly going to make sure Floridians know that — not to mince words,"""" Bill Piper, national affairs director with the Drug Policy Alliance, told Politico. Did Wasserman Schultz repeatedly take votes to send dying patients to prison? Politico reported in a follow-up article that Wasserman Schultz offered to change her opposition if Orlando lawyer John Morgan, the force behind the Florida ballot initiative, stopped bashing her, which she denied in an interview with the Sun Sentinel. Morgan hopes to get a revised version on the ballot in 2016. Wasserman Schultz’s marijuana voting record The Drug Policy Alliance pointed to several of Wasserman Schultz’s votes, including on a congressional amendment that banned the use of federal money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws. The goal of the amendment, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., was to prevent federal agents from raiding retail operations in states where medical pot is legal. (We looked at a similar claim by another pro-pot group about her vote in 2014.) Wasserman Schultz, one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment on May 30, 2014, said she didn’t want to """"limit the executive branch’s ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion."""" The language was attached to another bill and signed into law in December. (She voted against similar failed amendments four times between 2005 and 2012.) Her vote on those amendments """"was very much focused on patients, and the fear of arrest they and their caregivers live under,"""" Piper told PolitiFact Florida. He also argued that the Florida ballot measure -- which Wasserman Schultz opposed -- would have protected patients using medical marijuana. Last year, she said the Florida ballot initiative was """"written too broadly and stops short of ensuring strong regulatory oversight from state officials."""" Piper also pointed to Wasserman Schultz’s """"no"""" vote on an April 2014 congressional amendment on a spending bill for Veterans Affairs. The amendment, which failed, would have allowed VA doctors to talk to their patients about medical marijuana in states in which it is legal. But it’s a stretch to say that her """"no"""" vote means she wants dying patients to go to prison. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett told the Washington Post at the time that she felt it was premature to vote on the amendment. She wanted to wait for the results of a study approved by the federal government to look at marijuana’s potential effects on post-traumatic stress disorder. Do feds put terminally ill patients in prison? Do these votes mean she repeatedly voted to send terminally ill patients to prison? That’s a stretch. Even before her 2014 congressional votes, there were reasons that users were not a priority for the feds. In 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys telling them to focus on cartels or other criminal organizations. Beyond that, the Justice Department said it was content to allow state and local agencies """"to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws."""" The pro-pot lobby has pointed to cases of growers prosecuted for serving ill patients, including transplant recipient Jerry Duval, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Duval was a state-registered caregiver but prosecutors argued he peddled pot to non-patients. One high-profile case remains pending -- initially dubbed Kettle Falls 5, named for defendants in eastern Washington. Prosecutors say the five defendants were conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana, and they were also charged with possessing firearms. One defendant, Larry Harvey, told USA Today that the pot he grew was for personal medical use. On Feb. 18, the Justice Department dropped the charges against Harvey, 71, who was recently diagnosed with stage-four pancreatic cancer. However, the charges remain for his wife, two other relatives and a family friend. Law professors we interviewed told us that the federal government hasn’t focused on individuals who simply use marijuana for their own medical needs, and that was true even before the congressional amendment passed. """"The feds don't send people to prison for using marijuana,"""" Vanderbilt law Professor Robert Mikos told PolitiFact Florida. """"They do deny some benefits to users (like access to some VA services). And the law authorizes prison for users. But the law is not enforced so rigidly."""" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the amendment passed last year """"may well constrain federal prosecution of medical marijuana suppliers in states where their activities are legal."""" However, he added, the fact that the Kettle Falls case is still going forward shows such prosecutions still can happen. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz """"voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison,"""" Piper said. She voted against amendments to ban the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. In theory, advocates believe that the amendment -- which passed late in 2014 after multiple attempts -- prevents the feds from going after sick marijuana users in states that allow medical marijuana. However, even before the amendment passed, dying patients who simply smoked joints that they obtained legally were not being hauled off to prison en masse by federal agents. Instead, the federal government focused on major suppliers or distributors. Saying Wasserman Schultz voted to send people to prison significantly exaggerates the issue. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",1
"""An undated police mugshot photo shows Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of the French Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) company, displayed on the """"red notice"""" posted by Interpol on its website. REUTERS/Interpol In the first arrests since the two-year-old scandal made headlines worldwide in December, Mas and a second executive at his now defunct company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were seized at their homes in southern France shortly after dawn. The detention could lead within hours to Mas being placed under formal investigation on suspicion of manslaughter and causing bodily harm. That could in due course lead to criminal charges, which would carry longer sentences than those he now faces in a fraud case expected to be tried around October. Women who have been campaigning against PIP since French authorities banned its products nearly two years ago welcomed the move as giving them a sense that the law was now in action:   “It’s been too long,” said Murielle Ajellio, who heads an association for women with implants. Up to now, she said: “You feel like you’re fighting against the wind.”   French authorities have been criticized for being slow to react to a case that has sown fear among tens of thousands of women who carry PIP implants. French inspectors ordered them off the market in March 2010, due to concerns over their quality. But only last month did officials in Paris recommend their surgical removal, drawing attention to the problem for patients worldwide who had been fitted with products from the company, which was at one time the third biggest global supplier. Lawyers for women in France who have filed complaints over PIP implants welcomed the arrests and said there must be no escaping justice for the 72-year-old Mas, who has been quoted as deriding those suing him as being motivated only by money. “This is a comfort for the victims,” said Laurent Gaudon, whose clients are pursuing PIP and surgeons who used its implants for fraud. “It’s the feeling that justice is advancing and they have not been forgotten. It’s the assurance that the guilty are at last going to be held accountable.”   Philippe Courtois, who represents 1,300 people with PIP implants, said Mas should not be freed pending any trial. Mas and PIP’s former chief executive Claude Couty were questioned at home, as police conducted searches. They were then moved to police custody in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille, under the orders of prosecutor Jacques Dallest. PIP enjoyed years of success with international sales, but behind the scenes employees, and Mas himself, have admitted to hiding from certification agencies the fact they were using cheap, industrial silicone, not approved for medical use. Health authorities in France and elsewhere have stressed that PIP’s products carry no proven link to cancer, but surgeons report that they have abnormally high rupture rates. Responses to the problem have varied among different foreign authorities. Thursday’s arrests follow an investigation opened in Marseille, close to PIP’s former premises, on December 8 after the death from cancer in 2010 of a woman with PIP implants. Mas and Couty can be held for up to 48 hours while a judge decides whether to open a formal probe and, if so, what bail conditions, if any, to set. A trial date could be years away, given the extent of inquiry required, but the graver manslaughter case could make it harder for Mas to avoid appearing in court later this year on other charges of fraud and deception. That latter case targets half a dozen former PIP executives and could also carry prison terms for them of several years. It has dragged on as investigators have had to quiz up to 2,700 women who have filed complaints over PIP implants. Mas, who sold some 300,000 implants around the world, has acknowledged that he used unapproved silicone but dismissed fears that it constituted a health risk. Earlier in January, leaks from a police document showed Mas admitting to lying about the quality of PIP’s implants and describing the women filing complaints against him as just seeking money. The comments sparked public anger against him. PIP closed down in March 2010 after regulators discovered it was using a non-approved, industrial silicone gel, and pulled its implants off the market. Last month, the French government advised women with PIP implants to have them removed, and said it would pay for the operations in France, sparking alarm around the world. Officials in several other countries, including Britain and Brazil, have asked women to visit their doctors for checks. France has called for tighter European Union regulations on medical devices in wake of the PIP affair, saying suppliers of prosthetics should require the same sort of authorization as manufacturers of prescription medicines.""",0
"As it usually does, the Healthy Skeptic column itemized costs of the products in question. See “evidence” criterion above The story explained: “Over-the-counter testosterone products may carry hidden dangers. A 2008 study in Clinical Cancer Research found that two men taking a supplement called Teston-6 developed unusually aggressive, fast-growing prostate cancer. Lab tests showed that the product contained hormones (including testosterone) that weren’t on the label, a common issue with noNPRescription products. The manufacturer quickly pulled it from the market. “The problem with these sorts of supplements is that they don’t have to meet the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration,” says Dolores Lamb, a coauthor of the Teston-6 study and professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.”",0
"""Costs are not applicable as there is no diagnostic test developed yet. Quantified benefits do not apply, as this study was not a clinical trial. Quantified harms are not directly applicable to this type of research. Note, however, that there is a harm of assigning a label of """"pre RA"""" to a perfectly healthy person with a positive blood test of unknown significance. There are always potential harms of screening; as in this story, though, they are often ignored.""",1
"No cost information, whatsoever. This rating is borderline as the article noted: “They said for women using the drug, the number of additional ‘satisfying sexual events’ averaged out to about 0.5 per month.”  What would give this increased meaning is what the baseline was. If the baseline is zero or 0.5, maybe increasing that by half a satisfying sexual encounter might be meaningful. If the baseline is 10, does half an additional encounter make any difference? Later in the article we learn that “10% more patients” had meaningful sexual encounters, but what exactly does that mean? “10%” of what? The article tips decisively into Not Satisfactory territory with its unbalanced focus on unrepresentative anecdotes depicting women who had “life-changing” improvements. We learn the drugs have side effects but nothing about the fainting, falls and somnolence that are known side effects of the drug. The patient with the testimonial is quoted saying: “I should be able to choose whether the side effects are worth the benefit.” We agree. But we also agree that anyone reading this article should get a sense of what those side effects are likely to be and how often they occur. A systematic review is the highest form of evidence and it’s at the peak of the evidence pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid is anecdote and opinion. And yet the story puts these two pieces of evidence on an equal footing and seems to give them equal weight. People who criticize systematic reviews and ‘tear them apart’  have to indicate why the review is faulty. Instead we get a conflicted clinician with known ties to an organization dependent on pharmaceutical money and pharmaceutical companies promoting drugs for female sexual problems saying that the study had “erroneous conclusions.” And the main reason given is that the review included unpublished studies — when withholding those studies from the review would have introduced a clear bias. This is completely unacceptable. If the studies are erroneous, we need to hear a plausible explanation as to why — preferably from someone who’s not conflicted by relationships with drug manufacturers. There are many who would say that HSDD is a construction by the pharmaceutical industry keen to capitalize off women’s sexual health. Whether you agree with that perspective or not, if you are writing about a controversial condition, you must include some coverage of that controversy, otherwise you are at risk of further medicalizing and hyping a condition that maybe doesn’t, in most cases, warrant a medical treatment approach. It was unfortunate not to have included the many and direct ties between those attacking the review (such as the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health, which is supported by pharmaceutical manufacturers) and one of their board members, Dr. Lauren Streicher, who has declared ties to Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. We know that patient testimony at the flibanserin hearings at the FDA was supported by Sprout, the maker of flibanserin, which gave financial support to those attending the hearings. But it is unclear if the patient mentioned in this story received such support. The ‘alternative’ in the clinical studies was, presumably, a placebo, yet as some commentators have noted, the drug has never been tested against a more holistic approach that acknowledges the complexity of female sexuality and which address physical, psychological, and social factors. The story notes that the drug has been on the market since October, 2015. This is definitely a novelty and the article reflects that accurately. Other than Dr. Lauren Streicher and the patient Jodi Cole who seem to keep appearing and reappearing in other stories on this study, there is no evidence of being overly-reliant on a press release.",1
"""During a recent interview with Fox News, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., raised the specter of the Internal Revenue Service -- an agency currently under fire for appearing to target conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- collecting a database full of """"intimate"""" details about Americans. Referring to an inspector general’s report on IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, """"So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care. There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible."""" We’ve already rated two of her claims from this exchange, which came during a May 15, 2013, interview on the Fox News show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. We gave Bachmann a False for saying that the IRS is """"going to be in charge of our health care,"""" and we gave her a rating for her claim that """"The IRS will have the ability potentially"""" to deny or delay health care. In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s correct to say that the IRS is going to be in charge of """"a huge national database"""" on health care that will include Americans’ """"personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets."""" After the interview with Van Susteren aired, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, told PolitiFact that she stands by her charge. As evidence, he cited a passage from a Wall Street Journal editorial published one day before her television appearance. The editorial described a Federal Data Services hub that is taking """"the IRS's own records (for income and employment status) and centralizing them with information from Social Security (identity), Homeland Security (citizenship), Justice (criminal history), HHS (enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data) and state governments (residency). The data hub will be used as the verification system for ObamaCare's complex subsidy formula. ... """"Good luck in advance to anyone who gets caught in this system's gears, assuming it even works. Centralizing so much personal information in one place is another invitation for the IRS wigglers in some regional office—or maybe higher up—to make political decisions about enforcement."""" We see four key questions for fact-checking Bachmann’s claim. First, is the government constructing a database? Second, will the IRS be """"in charge"""" of it? Third, would it include """"personal"""" or """"intimate"""" details? And fourth, would it affect all, or most, Americans? We’ll take these issues in order. Is the government constructing a database? Not by the traditional definition of """"database."""" The """"hub"""" the government is creating is a mechanism for extracting data from a variety of databases that exist at other agencies. The hub doesn’t collect, centralize and store data; it is designed to allow real-time access to data that resides on the servers of other agencies in order to verify transactions related to the health insurance exchanges created under Obama’s law. In an April 22, 2013, release, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of HHS, said that it has completed the hub’s technical design and is in the midst of testing it. """"The hub will not store consumer information, but will securely transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information,"""" the center said in the statement. HHS pledges """"strict privacy controls to safeguard personal information,"""" added Brian Cook, a spokesman for the department. """"This is not a huge national database of health records,"""" said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom. Will the IRS be """"in charge"""" of the hub? No. It’s being built by HHS, specifically by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. To ensure compatibility, the IRS needs to cooperate with HHS on the effort, but the IRS has only a supporting role in building the system, and the IRS will not be able to use the hub to view information in the other agencies’ databases. Will the hub include """"personal"""" or """"intimate"""" details? The hub is not designed to access, much less store, information like body mass index, or whether you have a serious illness or ingrown toenails. The hub will be able to tell if someone has insurance or not, but it will not access records about their health. It could access other """"personal"""" details beyond health status, including adjusted gross income and Social Security numbers, but those already exist in federal databases, so the hub wouldn’t represent an expansion of federal data collection. Would the hub affect all, or most Americans? No. The data won’t be accessed by the hub unless an individual logs on to the new insurance exchanges in order to purchase insurance. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for health insurance subsidies on the exchange in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017. So the numbers of Americans who might eventually interact with the hub aren’t trivial -- but it’s important to note that even if everyone who’s eligible takes the opportunity to use the exchanges, they would represent a small fraction of all Americans. People who have employer-provided insurance or are on Medicare, Medicaid, veterans health care or most other forms of government-provided insurance should have no need to interact with the hub at all. Our ruling Bachmann said the IRS is going to be """"in charge"""" of """"a huge national database"""" on health care that will include Americans’ """"personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets."""" The congresswoman chooses to believe that the IRS and the rest of the government intend to delve ever-further into Americans’ personal lives. We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but as best we can tell now, she has mischaracterized the intent and limitations of the hub. It’s not a """"database."""" The IRS isn’t running it. It won’t include """"intimate"""" health data. And most Americans won’t need to interact with it at all.""",1
"While there’s no doubt the 2016 election cycle has been one of the more unusual ones in recent history, perhaps the culmination of the parade of bizarre rumors about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is that she was killed off in 1998 and is now represented by one of her many clones. Rumors have abounded that Clinton’s health is failing, alongside the idea that she has every disease from subcortical vascular dementia to Parkinson’s. These claims were bolstered by footage of Clinton nearly collapsing while leaving a 11 September 2016 ceremony due to a pneumonia diagnosis, which also sparked a new round of death rumors. But on 15 September 2016, a blog called “Ascension with Mother Earth and Current State of Affairs” took the weirdness to a whole new extreme by seemingly mashing all the rumors about Clinton into one giant conglomeration: Fact: Hillary Clinton has been dead since 1998. Another fact: The entire Clinton Family was eliminated and cloned beneath Camp David at the same time — including Chelsea (who’s husband is her handler; Huma is Hillary’s handler) Meaning, none of the current human replicas claiming to be true Clinton’s have a soul, and none are in fact human. This is how and why they always lie in public sly no matter the social cost. They’re soulless beings, performing daily tasks based on a common agenda set forth by their dark nobility handlers. Wow, that’s a lot to digest, right? Let’s go a little further down the rabbit hole shall we. Fact: What you have been watching all of years are human replicas or laboratory grown clones. They can be grown to full maturity in less than 3 days now, and their entire memories transferred–and even stored on computers–then downloaded into replacement clones. There are half dozen Bill and Hillary’s that travel with the Clinton entourages and are on reserve 24/7/355 should the hero clone fail. Sadly, there none left for Hillary on Sunday, so a well trained body double was pressed into action first to walk out of Chelsea’s apartment post fall, then today was made to do public appearances like on Hillary’s campaign plane as well as that faux North Carolina press conference. For starters, there were no known instances of human cloning (let alone advanced cloning that could result in a fully-mature adult in three days), until 2008, when scientists successfully cloned a human embryo. To date, there are no known cloned humans to have grown past the very early stages of gestation: From a technical perspective, cloning humans and other primates is more difficult than in other mammals. One reason is that two proteins essential to cell division, known as spindle proteins, are located very close to the chromosomes in primate eggs. Consequently, removal of the egg’s nucleus to make room for the donor nucleus also removes the spindle proteins, interfering with cell division. In other mammals, such as cats, rabbits and mice, the two spindle proteins are spread throughout the egg. So, removal of the egg’s nucleus does not result in loss of spindle proteins. In addition, some dyes and the ultraviolet light used to remove the egg’s nucleus can damage the primate cell and prevent it from growing. It’s rather subjective to claim that clones wouldn’t have “souls” considering a clone would be, in effect, a distinct living organism and also the idea of a soul is more theological than scientific. The problematic distinction of who has a soul and who does not can be seen in the the late 6th Century European debate over whether or not women had souls. To additionally claim the entire Clinton family was wiped out or “eliminated” in 1998 is of course beyond the pale, as Bill Clinton was the sitting U.S. President until 2001. Hillary Clinton has held high-profile political offices, both as a New York senator and Secretary of State, since 1998 as well. The family has been continuously in the public eye and there is no sign that anything so catastrophic happened to them. Moreover the claim that “their entire memories transferred — and even stored on computers — then downloaded into replacement clones” seems to be plagiarized from science fiction.",1
"""State Sen. Dave Marsden says expanding Medicaid in Virginia will save lives. And he points to Massachusetts’ experience as proof. """"When Massachusetts got health care, their mortality rate went down either 2.9 or 3.9 percent -- whatever -- but it saved lives,"""" Marsden, D-Fairfax, said during a June 18 radio interview. Marsden’s comments, made on the John Fredericks Show, came amid fiery partisan debate over whether to expand Medicaid eligibility to as many as 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Uncle Sam would pay the entire tab through 2016 and 90 percent of added cost down the road. On June 12, the Republican-led General Assembly passed a two-year state budget designed to close Democratic routes toward expansion. We found Marsden’s comment interesting and wondered whether whether the death rate in Massachusetts really did fall by at least 2.9 percent after then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a health reform bill in 2006 that expanded Medicaid and mandated individual health care coverage. Brent McKenzie, Marsden’s legislative assistant, said the statement was based on a study by  the Harvard School of Public Health that was published in May 2014 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers examined the death rates in Massachusetts counties before and after the reforms were enacted, looking at the periods from 2001-2005 and 2007-2010. They concluded that the death rate per 100,000 people aged 20 to 64 dropped dropped 3.2 percent during the years after the reforms. The data was compared to statistics of people in the same age group from 531 counties in 46 states that had not undergone coverage expansions. The researchers concluded that the decline in Massachusetts was 2.9 percent greater than the average of the U.S. counties that had not expanded coverage. """"What we found in Massachusetts after reform was a significant reduction in deaths from the kinds of illnesses where we expect health care to have the biggest impact, including infections, cancer and cardiovascular disease,"""" Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy at Harvard and a report co-author, said in a news release announcing the results. The study also found the largest death rate drops occurred in Massachusetts counties that had low insurance coverage prior to the reforms. A key advantage of the Harvard study was its size -- examining an estimated 270,000 Massachusetts adults gained insurance through the reform. Although the study found a correlation between health care coverage and lower death rates, there’s on-going debate over whether the reforms caused that result. The Harvard School of Public Health report estimated that state’s mandatory insurance laws prevented about 320 deaths a year. But researchers cautioned that they couldn’t definitively """"establish cause and effect"""" between the lowered death rate and the reforms. They also noted that the results in Massachusetts """"may not generalize to other states."""" """"We find significant reduction in mortality among nonelderly adults in Massachusetts since its 2006 reform relative to a control group in counties of similar counties in states without such reforms,"""" the report says. """"Although this analysis cannot demonstrate causality, the results offer suggestive evidence that the Affordable Care Act -- modeled after the Massachusetts law -- may impact not only coverage and access but also mortality."""" An article in the New York Times said health economists viewed the report as strong evidence that the Massachusetts’ health care overhaul had saved lives, but noted experts also said the study """"will not settle the long-debated question on whether being insured prolongs life."""" Some analysts quoted in The Times and in a Boston Globe article said the results add to a body of research showing health care coverage extends lives. But skeptics questioned whether the death rate drop found in the study would occur so quickly after the Massachusetts reforms took root. The Harvard report notes other studies have looked at the effect of health insurance on mortality and the results have been mixed. A 2012 report in the New England Journal of Medicine found that several states that expanded their Medicaid eligibility programs before Obamacare passed in 2010 saw """"significant decreases in mortality."""" The researchers noted, however, that they """"cannot definitively show causality."""" In contrast, a 2011 study of Medicaid expansion in Oregon did not find a link between health insurance and death rates. A 2013 follow-up study found that the state’s Medicaid expansion led to better mental health and lower financial strain among beneficiaries, but researchers did not find improvement in important physical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Our ruling Marsden said that after Massachusetts enacted its sweeping health care reform in 2006, its mortality rate dropped by at least 2.9 percent, """"saving lives."""" His statement correctly summarizes a recent study finding the state’s death rate dropped by 3.2 percent among 20-64 year-olds. The decline was 2.9 percent greater than the average of a comparison group of 531 counties across the nation. But Marsden reaches a little when he says the results proved the health reforms """"saved lives."""" Researchers believe that’s the case, but caution they could not establish a """"cause and effect"""" between the lowered death rate and the health reforms. So Marsden’s statement is accurate, but needs a little clarification.""",0
"No dollar signs here, which — as we discovered — is quite an oversight, given the steep costs of adalimumab. Prednisone costs about $0.33 per mg, and chronic uveitis patients take anywhere from 10 mg to 60 mg per day. Looking at the minimum number (which patients are usually tapered to 6 months into their treatment), that’s a cost of more than $1,190 a year. In comparison, the name-brand of adalimumab, Humira, costs about $54.49 per mg. In the study, patients received adalimumab on a bi-weekly basis, receiving some 1,640 mg of the drug over 80 weeks if they didn’t drop out. That adds up to a total of $89,400 — an average of $58,000 per year or $1,120 per week. The benefits are well-represented in the release, and so is their context. By working adalimumab into the standard treatment, most of the key measurements of uveitis are held in check for nearly twice as long in a typical patient — 24 weeks instead of 13 weeks. This represents improvement — but not a cure — for a chronic disease. The harms covered in the study were glossed over in the release, in particular by this sentence: “[P]atients in the adalimumab group reported serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, more frequently than those in the placebo group.” Given what was left out, we’ll mark this one unsatisfactory. What’s not mentioned is that 16% patients in the adalimumab group dropped out compared to less than 7% in the placebo group. We also learned that some of the adverse events that triggered dropout weren’t included in the release: “Adverse events leading to discontinuation of participation in the trial were more common in the adalimumab group and included choroidal neovascularization, blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, fatigue, malaise, and suicidal ideation.” Something simple that the release could have characterized about the adalimumab treatment’s harms, but didn’t: it had three times the rate of “adverse events” and twice as many serious adverse events. Including any of these numbers — and some of the harms that taking corticosterids like prednisone can cause (the best we get is “many unwanted side effects”) — would have put the harms and benefits of the adalimumab treatment into clearer context. This is perhaps the greatest strength of the release. It not only clearly explains the reasons for the drug trial and the metrics of measurement, but also the activity through which the drug might work. The report involves a randomized controlled trial, so a strong evidence level is expected, and the release did note the industry sponsorship. It’s well known that studies sponsored by industry report favorable results more frequently, which makes some sense, in that companies wouldn’t test drugs they didn’t have strong preliminary evidence for. But it’s also possible that industry sponsorship can bias the conduct and reporting of such studies to make a positive outcome more likely. We couldn’t find anything that would scare a reader. In fact, the release perhaps went a little too far to the other end of the spectrum and didn’t mention the word “blindness” once, which is a possible outcome of uveitis if left untreated. The release dedicates a whole paragraph to summarizing potential conflicts of interest, which is welcome and we hope to see this kind of transparency showing up in more releases in the future. It further directs readers to the published study’s supplementary documents for more extensive disclosure information. In the PDF of supplementary materials we learned that only two out of the 17 authors had no conflicts of interest to declare. Although the release mentions the weakness of corticosteroids in uveitis treatment, it doesn’t go far enough in explaining how steroids compare with adalimumab, even though steroids were given to the patients concurrently with adalimumab in “diminishing doses” throughout the trial. It’s worth noting, especially for comparison with adalimumab, how the long-term use of corticosteroid drugs work against uveitis symptoms by suppressing the body’s entire immune system — and, as a side effect, metabolism — not just one specific target of inflammation. Humira also suppresses the body’s immune system although through a different mechanism. The level of detail is good here, noting that the FDA recently approved adalimumab for noninfectious uveitis, how it was previously approved for other conditions, and in which types of uveitis it’s generally ok to treat. The novelty is somewhat nuanced, but explained well enough: Uveitis is a bag full of symptoms, and the damage involved can span across the entire eye. By measuring how it affected the most frequent symptoms, “the study’s results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients” and possibly help lead to longer-term solutions for uveitis. We didn’t see anything that’s cause for alarm.",0
"Back in March 2013, a Twitter user posted an image of Magic Johnson (who is HIV positive) having blood drawn alongside the worrisome claim that Johnson was “donating blood for charity,” a rumor which later evolved to indicate the blood was to be used for leukemia and lymphoma patients:   At the time the initial tweet began to circulate, the image was traced back to its original source, which proved to be a documentary titled Endgame: AIDS in Black America. The rumor died down until a fake news site rediscovered the picture and false attribution and ran with them, adding the embellishment about leukemia and lymphoma patients. That article stated:  Retired NBA star, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, has decided to run a blood drive in conjunction with American Red Cross to support the National Awareness Month for Leukemia and Lymphoma. So far, Johnson has had a of 1,827 donors including himself and has saved about 438 patients so far. Many people are finding it odd and a bit terrifying that Johnson is donating his blood as well since he has been diagnosed as HIV+ since November of 1991. Since then, it has been reported that Magic’s HIV cell count remains so low that it is considered dormant. Although considered dormant, the virus still lives within Johnson.",1
"The story doesn’t mention how much this therapy might cost or how it might compare to the current standard treatment, hormone replacement therapy. According to the website CostHelper, hormone replacement therapy costs $10 to $85 per month for patients without insurance. The story said women who took MLE4901 — who had been experiencing at least seven hot flashes per day — “had the frequency of their hot flashes reduced by 72 percent and the severity of hot flashes decreased by 38 percent. This improvement started as early as three days after first taking the drug and relief continued for the whole month of treatment.” These are relative risk reductions. It would have been more informative to state how often women typically had hot flashes before treatment, and how often they had them afterward, using absolute numbers. Similarly, the story does not state what sort of scale was used to rate the severity of the hot flashes. Rather than describe the benefit as a 38% reduction, the story could have stated the typical severity of hot flashes on that scale before and after treatment. Also, what were the changes in the placebo group? More: Reporting the findings: Absolute vs relative risk. It also says, “Sleep and concentration improved after three days, too, which was an added bonus. The researchers noted that those improvements could have been related to the reduction in hot flashes.” The story would have been more informative had it quantified both the number of women who experienced improvements after three days — since that was the key finding — and their improvements in sleep and concentration, since that’s a benefit many women would care about. The story states that a “previous study on MLE4901 was associated with liver toxicity in a few participants, which resolved when they stopped taking it. They hope slightly modifying the drug may improve that side effect.” That harm should have been mentioned higher in the story, rather in the second-to-last paragraph. In addition, the story doesn’t say anything about what adverse effects were observed in this particular study — that information should have been included. The story does some things right, mentioning this was a “small study” involving 37 women who had at least seven hot flashes per day. The groups received either MLE4901 twice a day for 4 weeks, or a placebo pill on the same schedule. Two weeks later the groups swapped their treatments. However, it doesn’t explore whether the women in the study were representative of the “millions” the story claimed might be helped by such a drug. For example, it’s unclear how many women in menopause have at least seven hot flashes per day, which seems like a very high number. More importantly, the story is misleading when it states that “larger studies” on MLE4901 are underway. According to a news release, the “specific compound” tested in this trial “will not be taken further in trials, due to side effects that may affect liver function. However, two very similar drugs, which also block NKB but do not appear to carry these side effects have entered larger patient trials, with one such trial launched in the US last year.” It remains to be seen whether the “similar drugs” will have the same effect. The lead of the story refers to “millions of women in menopause who suffer with hot flashes.” The story later states, “About 70 percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms -— the familiar hot flashes — which, in some cases, last for years. However, it’s far from clear how many women might stand to benefit from this type of drug. As mentioned under Quality of Evidence, the story doesn’t make clear how many women experience the high frequency of hot flashes of those who were in this study. The story uses only quotes in a news release and contains no independent sources. Two of the authors of the study are employees of Millendo Therapeutics, which has licensed the rights to the compound. Two other authors are listed on a patent related to this method of treatment. The story does the minimum by mentioning the current standard treatment, hormone replacement therapy. It states: “The previous ‘go to’ therapy was supplemental estrogen, which proved to have side effects like blood clots or even breast cancer.” While it’s laudable to bring up estrogen replacement and its drawbacks, it also misleading to call it a “previous go to,” since it’s still the standard therapy for menopausal symptoms. Also, the story doesn’t say whether this drug has been compared to hormone replacement in terms of effectiveness. Also, the story doesn’t mention other therapies such as low-dose antidepressants and lifestyle changes that might relieve hot flashes. The story states states: “Larger studies on MLE4901 are underway in the U.S. and U.K. that will help gain an understanding of the drug’s safety and effectiveness. Like any new drug, safety and effectiveness have to be proven to the FDA before the drug can be offered in the U.S.” The story quotes a researcher who says “this new analysis confirms the beneficial effect is obtained very quickly — within just three days.” That’s backed by the conclusion of the analysis itself, which reads that the drug “rapidly relieves (hot flashes) without the need for estrogen exposure.” The story appears to be based entirely from a news release. This quote is taken directly from the news release without attribution: The potential for this drug class to really improve many of the symptoms of the menopause, such as hot [flashes], difficulty sleeping, weight gain, and poor concentration, is huge,” lead author Dr. Julia Prague of the Imperial College London. “To see the lives of our participants change so dramatically and so quickly was so exciting, and suggests great promise for the future of this new type of treatment.”",1
"In March 2018, a series of news articles sparked reports that a group of doctors in Canada were resisting and protesting against a pay increase offered to them by the provincial government in Quebec: Hundreds of Canadian doctors, medical specialists and residents, as well as medical students, have signed a petition protesting their own pay raises, instead asking that the money be reallocated to help nurses and patients in need. “We, Quebec doctors who believe in a strong public system, oppose the recent salary increases negotiated by our medical federations,” reads the letter, originally posted in French, the official language in the Canadian province. It is true that hundreds of doctors signed the petition, but the group opposing the deals makes up only a small fraction of all the doctors in the province of Quebec, a piece of context not mentioned in most reports. On 25 February 2018, MQRP (which stands for Médecins Québécois pour le Régime Public, or Quebecois Doctors for the Public Plan, a group of 500 Quebecois doctors dedicated to retaining the province’s universal public health system) published an open letter explaining their opposition to pay hikes negotiated between doctors’ unions and the provincial government. These increases are all the more shocking given that our fellow nurses, clerks and other employees are suffering very difficult working conditions, while our patients live with the lack of access to needed services caused by the draconian cuts of recent years, and the centralization of power at the Ministry of Health. The only thing that seems to be immune to cuts is our pay. …We Quebecois doctors demand that the pay increases granted be cancelled and the resources of the system be better distributed for the benefit of all health workers and to ensure the system of healthcare that the people of Quebec deserve. As of 21 March, the letter had garnered 944 signatures from people describing themselves as doctors or medical students. It’s not clear whether or how MQRP is able to prevent someone who is not a registered medical professional from signing the online petition, so we can’t be sure how many of the names listed under the letter actually belong to health professionals. Even if they all do, the 944 names listed on 21 March 2018 would still make up only 4.5 percent of the total number of doctors in Quebec. (According to the Collège des Médecins du Quebec, the standards-setting professional body for doctors in Quebec, there are nearly 21,000 active, registered doctors in the province as of 1 January 2018.) Canada’s CBC News reported that the provincial government had struck two major pay deals with doctors: As part of a deal reached earlier this month, the province’s 10,000 medical specialists will see their annual salary rise from $4.7 billion to $5.4 billion in 2023, an increase of 1.4 per cent each year. According to data compiled by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, specialists in Quebec make, on average, $403,537 a year, compared to $367,154 in Ontario. Quebec’s GPs signed an eight-year deal with the province last October that sees their pay increase by an average of 1.8 per cent per year.",0
"The absence of cost information is unfortunate in this release. In general, the public has little experience of or understanding of the overall costs of routine, widespread screening. Sources put the cost of A1C screening at anywhere from $12 to $65. There are nearly 4 million live births in the U.S. each year, and many more pregnancies. Even if we use a $35 midpoint price, that’s $140 million just to screen for gestational diabetes. Worth it? Maybe. Particularly given that the glucose tolerance test given later in pregnancy has an average cost of $60 to $85, according to some sources. And the savings to be realized in potentially preventing gestational diabetes could be substantial. In any case, cost considerations are important in the overall scheme of health care delivery and limited health care dollars. The release quantifies the results and potential benefits by noting that each 0.1 percent increase in HbA1c levels above 5.1 percent  in early pregnancy was associated with a 22 percent higher risk for gestational diabetes. The blood test itself is virtually harmless, and overall fairly reliable, but results can be skewed by a variety of unrelated diseases and lifestyle factors, resulting in false positives and negatives. The release notes the observational nature of the data and the relatively small number of women overall in the two groups analyzed and compared. Readers don’t learn much about the population of women studied — age, race, number of pregnancies, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, etc. But given that the release makes clear more research would be needed to prove the association identified in the study, we give this a “satisfactory” rating. No mongering, but no data about frequency of the disorder, either. Although not explicit, it seems clear the research was funded by NIH. There currently is no standardized screening test for identifying gestational diabetes in the first trimester. Earlier research into the usefulness of HbA1c testing for gestational diabetes in early pregnancy have been limited to high risk groups. The release makes clear that this test is far from ready for use in clinical screening. It states: The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy. The release is clear about the theoretical potential of the test to determine early risk, and eventually, the theoretical potential of lifestyle changes to modify that risk. None here.",0
"On 8 December 2016, fake news site Thug Life Videos published an article reporting that a Canadian man named Kenneth Gillespie had been hospitalized for penile frostbite after drunkenly attempting to have sexual relations with a snowman: A 64 year-old was rushed into Centre hospitalier de l’Université Laval [in December 2016] with a most unusual medical complaint. He had frostbite of the P*NIS after getting drunk and trying to have s*x with a SNOWMAN. Kenneth Gillespie is known to locals as a drunk and a bit of a lecherous type, but this latest episode has had dire consequences. He was found passed out clutching onto his frozen junk by neighbors at 1.30am on Sunday morning and they called the ambulance straight away. The doctor in charge of Mr. Gillespie, Dr. Marc Arnadeu said this to a local TV news crew: “Frostbite of that area may sound funny but it is very serious indeed. Frostbite, of course, can cause infection and gangrene and ultimately this has led to Mr. Gillespie’s member being amputated. It’s very sad.” The snowman is thought to be okay, though. It’s since been rebuilt and cleaned … Some in Gillespie’s neighborhood are less than pleased, though. One told the Montreal Gazette this: “ … Several people have already vowed to dismember him after what he did to the kids’ snowman. He left a pile of empty bottles, a wrecked snowman and a trail of frozen man-juice in the middle of the community recreation ground. This b*stard’s worse than Bill Cosby.” On the surface, the tale of the sexy snowman appeared to be typical hoax news cooked up to garner social media traction. But iterations of a near-identical claim had been published several years earlier by Uproxx, The Frisky, and several radio blogs, all of which aren’t generally considered fake news sites. Uproxx’s 25 January 2013 item placed “Kenneth Guillespie” in Britain and made no mention of neighbors referencing Bill Cosby (who was not widely accused of sexual misconduct until October 2014, long after the snowman tale began trekking across the Internet): Regardless, this dude from the UK is obviously a freak in every way, so of course he was able to stick his diseased dong into an ice sculpture and impale it mercilessly until shooting a load. Habitual drunkard Kenneth Guillespie, 64, was found half-naked and screaming in agony next to the remains of the five-foot snow sculpture. And when he arrived for treatment at North Central infirmary in Blackburn, shocked medics found the booze-soaked layabout was suffering from FROSBITE of the JOHNSON. Someone At the hospital said that “Ken’s a regular visitor to A&E. Normally it’s just bumps and scrapes – or someone has giving him an ass whoopin’. “Occasionally he’ll get trapped in something or get an object wedged up him. But this is the most bizarre mishap yet.” But The unemployed former postman may not remain in one peice if the return to the scene of his whitemarish coupling — as local residents are said to be on the warpath. Ian Jessop of the Ramsgreave and Brownhill Community Security said: “ … He left” a pile of empty bottles, a wrecked snowman and a trail of frozen man-juice in the middle of the community recreation ground.” Most accounts cited a (since-deleted) page on a web site called Busted in Acadiana which was dated 21 January 2013 and featured a (once widely-circulated) photograph of what appeared to be news article evidencing the claim: That image led to the original source of the story, Sunday Sport, an outlet described by Wikipedia as somewhat akin to the Weekly World News as an unambiguous peddler of complete fabrications:",1
"Mistrust of first responders and widespread misinformation propagated by some community leaders has led many in affected areas of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to refuse vaccinations. Instead, they turn to traditional healers, whose clinics have contributed to the hemorrhagic fever’s spread. “It is not an imaginary disease,” Tshisekedi said after arriving in the city of Beni on his first tour of eastern Congo since being inaugurated in January. “If we follow the instructions, in two or three months Ebola will be finished,” he optimistically told a crowd after having his temperature taken and washing his hands, as required of all incoming passengers to Beni airport. Congo has suffered 10 outbreaks of Ebola, which causes severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, since the virus was discovered there in 1976. The current one has seen 1,264 confirmed and probable cases and 814 deaths since it was declared last August. It is surpassed only by the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa, in which more than 28,000 cases were reported and more than 11,000 people died. Following a series of attacks on treatment centers by unidentified assailants in February and March, the current outbreak is now spreading at its fastest rate yet. More than 100 cases were confirmed last week. Tshisekedi, who won a disputed election last December to succeed Joseph Kabila, also called on Tuesday for the disarmament of dozens of militia that operate in the east and whose presence has complicated the Ebola response. “The time of armed groups is over,” he said. “The new government is reaching out to these children of the country to surrender arms through disarmament programmes.”",0
"The story does address how the USPSTF recommendations may affect insurance coverage of mammography screening, as well as related congressional action mandating that insurers cover such screening. However, the story does not tell readers the bottom line: how much would a mammogram cost if it were not covered by insurance? While we found varying estimates, a 2011 paper stated that the overall cost of a mammogram was $266 — a considerable sum, and likely out of reach for many women. This was a shortcoming of both the Washington Post and New York Times stories. The story does not offer any detailed information on the potential benefits associated with mammogram screening. Instead, the story uses vague language, describing the USPSTF’s recommendations as saying that “screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74” and that “the likelihood of benefit is less” for women in their 40s. Exactly how much different are the potential benefits for these groups? That’s an important point, and the story doesn’t tell us. The story does note that the USPSTF recommendations are aimed only at women with an average risk of breast cancer, and it attempts to explain what that means, noting that it refers to women “who don’t have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease.” That’s useful information for readers, but the story could have noted that there are other factors that place women at elevated risk. A history of prior breast surgery, especially if the pathology demonstrated atypical hyperplasia [an abnormal overgrowth of cells] significantly increases the risk of a subsequent breast cancer. In addition, a woman’s menstrual history, age at first pregnancy, and other factors also influence risk. There are several risk assessment models that are widely available, but are underutilized, to help women and their physicians assess risk. It would have been helpful to at least acknowledge this, as there remains a lot of confusion over just what constitutes “average risk.” The story addresses harms briefly in two places. In one place, the story refers to “the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives,” though it doesn’t explain what over-diagnosis or false positives mean (potentially leaving many readers in the dark). The story also notes that “The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman’s health during her lifetime.” But it doesn’t give readers any idea of how serious this harm might be, or how common this scenario is. In short, the story does enough to earn a Satisfactory rating, but could have (and should have) done more. It’s worth noting that the New York Times piece did a top-notch job discussing harms. The story does, however, make clear that women should be informed consumers, and that — if well-informed — women should have the authority to weigh potential benefits against potential harms and make their own decisions about when and how often to get screened. That’s an important point, and one worth making. There is no specific study to evaluate or discuss in a story like this one; the USPSTF’s recommendations are based on an evaluation of all the available research literature on breast cancer screening and mammography. However, the story could have simply said that. As it is, while the story does tell readers what the USPSTF is, it doesn’t say anything about what the task force based its recommendations on. No disease mongering here. The story incorporates input from several independent sources. Comments from Fran Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition are worth repeating: “Women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions.” The alternatives in a story like this one are the recommendations from other organizations. And the story does explain varying recommendations from the USPSTF and two other groups: the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Cancer Society. The story makes clear that the use of mammograms as breast cancer screening tools is longstanding and well established. The story also discusses insurance coverage issues that would affect availability for many women. The story does tell readers that the new recommendations on mammograms and breast cancer screening are consistent with the USPSTF’s 2009 recommendations — which triggered a fierce (and still ongoing) debate over the issue. The story also offers a good primer on congressional action related to the debate, particularly as pertains to legislation that mandates insurance coverage of mammograms for breast cancer screening. The story clearly includes original reporting and goes beyond what would be found in a news release.",0
"On 24 January 2017, the Facebook page “Live Action” published a video purportedly showing “Prenatal Care Deception” at Planned Parenthood, which has approximately 650 health centers operated by 57 affiliates across the U.S. The gist of the video’s presentation was that Planned Parenthood lies about providing reproductive and health services such as prenatal care, instead focusing solely on providing abortions:  This video quotes snippets of Richards’ saying: “Prenatal care. These are the kinds of services that folks depend on Planned Parenthood for,” and “a president who will fight for pre-natal care!” We could not find the specific origins of the first snippet, but it’s clear that Richards was listing several services that Planned Parenthood provides (and not claiming they offer only or primarily prenatal care), as she said “these are the kinds of services that folks depend on planned Parenthood for. But Live Action apparently omitted the first portion of her statement. The second snippet came from a 2016 speech in which Richards endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. The portion of the speech included in the Live Action video was less about what services Planned Parenthood offers and more about what qualities the organization was looking for in a U.S. president: They want a president who believes access to health care isn’t a luxury — it’s a human right. They want a president who understands that being pro-choice also means being able to choose to have a child — and a president who will fight for prenatal care, head start, health care for kids and first class public schools because it takes a village! They want a president who will stand up to the gun lobby and demand safety for kids in schools, folks in church, and women getting healthcare — no matter what. They want a president who will demand nobody is paid less just because they are a woman — we deserve 100 cents on the dollar! They want a president who believes that access to health care isn’t a luxury it’s a human right. They also want a president who understands that being pro-choice actually means being able to choose to have a child. And a president who will fight for pre-natal care, and head start, and health care for kids, and excellent public education. Because as someone so famously said, it takes a village to raise a child. The video also used a quote from Lori Lamerand, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Mid and South Michigan, to make it seem as if the organization were unjustly touting their prenatal care services. According to the video, Lamerand said: “Prenatal care! Um — and that — that is what we want to focus on. That is what is so vital.” But again, this quote was taken out of context from a speech Lamerand gave during the Pink Bus Tour in 2011, and according to Planned Parenthood, Lamerand “spoke about the vital services like birth control, pap smears, and preventative cancer screenings, which Planned Parenthood provides to women who otherwise might go without.” The context of these quotes is important since Live Action shared this video with the title “the Prenatal Care Deception.” In order to set up the “deception,” Live Action needed to try to establish that Planned Parenthood supposedly unjustly bragged about the prominence of their prenatal care services before offering supposed audio recordings of calls with Planned Parenthood representatives who stated that the organization did not in fact provide these services. Although Planned Parenthood does provide prenatal care services, those services are not a primary part of their operation. According to organization’s annual report for 2014-2015, they only provided 17,419 instances of prenatal care services (compared to 3,533,522 STD tests and 323,999 abortions.) Live Action offered no evidence that Planned Parenthood lied about these numbers, or that Planned Parenthood claimed they provide prenatal care services at all of their health centers. Not only did Live Action present Planned Parenthood’s comments without proper context, their investigation also presented a misleading picture about the services provided by the organization. We can’t verify if every one of the phone call recordings offered in the above-displayed video was genuine, but we can say that the claim “only 5 [Planned Parenthood] facilities out of 97” provide prenatal care is misleading at best. First of all, Planned Parenthood operates more than 650 facilities in the United States. In California alone, we found 13 Planned Parenthood clinics that advertise prenatal services. Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic (PPHP), which operates health centers in Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland counties, New York, provides prenatal care in 6 of their 10 health centers. We also found that many of the Planned Parenthood clinics that do not provide prenatal care services do nonetheless state they offer resources to assist those in need of finding such care: “If you choose to continue a pregnancy, we will provide you with a list of resources to help you obtain prenatal care.” (We also surveyed several Planned Parenthood offices ourselves. For example, we called the Family First Health Center in Fresno, California, who confirmed to us that they do in fact offer prenatal care services. We also contacted the Planned Parenthood office in Tempe, Arizona (one of the first locations mentioned in the video), who told us that they did not provide prenatal care services themselves but directed us to a nearby facility, the Mountain Park Health Center, that does.) The Live Action video is based on the implication that Planned Parenthood claimed to provide prenatal care services at all of their facilities, or that the organization was misleading the public about how often it provides these services. However, that simply isn’t the case: Mary Alice Carter, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, pointed out the group’s history of being targeted with selectively edited videos, and said that the new video tried to hold the organization to a standard it had not set for itself. “It is safe to say that not every single one of our health centers provides prenatal care, and we’ve never said otherwise,” Ms. Carter said. According to an annual report published in 2015, the most recent period for which information was available, eight Planned Parenthood affiliates of the 59 that existed at the time reported that they had provided 17,419 individual prenatal services. Ms. Carter said that “100 percent” of the organization’s health centers would provide what would be considered an initial prenatal visit, which would include a referral for further prenatal services that would be available elsewhere. It should be noted that the organization’s web site states that “Planned Parenthood health centers focus on prevention: 80 percent of our patients receive services to prevent unintended pregnancy,” and that Live Action chose to compare prenatal services (approximately 17,000 in 2014-2015) to abortions (more than 300,000) for this video, which gave the misleading impression that Planned Parenthood rarely provides reproductive health services other than abortions. In reality, Planned Parenthood provides more STD screenings (4,218,149), contraception services (2,945,059), and cancer screenings (682,208) than they do abortions.",1
"After less than a day of deliberations, the jury in New Brunswick, New Jersey rejected claims by Rosalind Henry and her husband, who had alleged that Henry’s mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure, was caused by the company’s talc products. J&J is facing some 10,600 liability lawsuits across the United States over its talc products, most involving claims that they caused ovarian cancer, and that the company knew of and concealed risks associated with the products. The company, which is based just a few miles from the courtroom where the latest case took place, said it was pleased with the unanimous jury verdict. “We have deep sympathy for anyone diagnosed with any form of cancer and appreciate that people are looking for answers. However, Johnson’s baby powder is not the cause of this disease,” the company said in a statement. It said decades of scientific testing by academic institutions and regulators have shown its talc to be safe and free of asbestos. A lawyer for Henry did not immediately return a request for comment. During trial, Henry’s lawyers said J&J had known for decades about asbestos fibers in its talc, but hid the evidence from regulators and consumers. J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. In April, J&J lost the first trial over such allegations when a jury in New Jersey awarded $117 million to a man suffering from mesothelioma and his wife. It lost another trial in May, when a California jury awarded $25.7 million to a woman diagnosed with mesothelioma. Both decisions are under appeal. Since then, the company has had four mistrials in similar  cases because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died. In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is also under appeal.",0
"Domestic violence has been a problem all too often ignored, covered up, and swept under the rug. Many well-intentioned and successful efforts have been made in the last few decades to bring the issue to public attention; to get the word out to women that they need not suffer silent, helpless, and alone; to advertise that there are organizations victims can turn to for help and support; and to educate others in spotting the signs of abuse. Unfortunately, nearly every cause will encompass a sub-group of advocates who, either through deliberate disingenuousness or earnest gullibility, end up spreading “noble lies” in the furtherance of that cause. The myth of Super Bowl Sunday violence is one such noble lie. The claim that Super Bowl Sunday is “the biggest day of the year for violence against women” is a case study of how easily an idea congruous with what people want to believe can be implanted in the public consciousness and anointed as “fact” even when there is little or no supporting evidence behind it. Christina Hoff Sommers charted a timeline of how the apocryphal statistic about domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday was widely (if erroneously) publicized over the course of a few days leading up to the Super Bowl in January 1993:  Thursday, January 28 A news conference was called in Pasadena, California, the site of the forthcoming Super Bowl game, by a coalition of women’s groups. At the news conference reporters were informed that significant anecdotal evidence suggested that Super Bowl Sunday is “the biggest day of the year for violence against women.” Prior to the conference, there had been reports of increases as high as 40 percent in calls for help from victims that day. At the conference, Sheila Kuehl of the California Women’s Law Center cited a study done at Virginia’s Old Dominion University three years before, saying that it found police reports of beatings and hospital admissions in northern Virginia rose 40 percent after games won by the Redskins during the 1988-89 season. The presence of Linda Mitchell at the conference, a representative of a media “watchdog” group called Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), lent credibility to the cause.At about this time a very large media mailing was sent by Dobisky Associates, warning at-risk women, “Don’t remain at home with him during the game.” The idea that sports fans are prone to attack wives or girlfriends on that climactic day persuaded many men as well: Robert Lipsyte of the New York Times would soon be referring to the “Abuse Bowl.”  Friday, January 29 Lenore Walker, a Denver psychologist and author of The Battered Woman, appeared on “Good Morning America” claiming to have compiled a ten-year record showing a sharp increase in violent incidents against women on Super Bowl Sundays. Here, again, a representative from FAIR, Laura Flanders, was present to lend credibility to the cause. Saturday, January 30 A story in the Boston Globe written by Linda Gorov reported that women’s shelters and hotlines are “flooded with more calls from victims [on Super Bowl Sunday] than on any other day of the year.” Gorov cited “one study of women’s shelters out West” that “showed a 40 percent climb in calls, a pattern advocates said is repeated nationwide, including in Massachusetts.” Commentators were quick to offers reasons why this “fact” was so obviously true: Men are mostly loutish brutes, and football is the epitome of mindless, aggressive, violent, testosterone-driven macho posturing, so certainly during the culmination of the football season and its final, spectacular, massively-hyped “super” game, more men than ever were going to express their excitement or disappointment by smacking their wives and girlfriends around. So much attention did the “Super Bowl abuse” stories garner that NBC aired a public service announcement before the 1993 game to remind men that domestic violence is a crime. Ken Ringle, a reporter for the Washington Post, was one of the few journalists to bother to check the sources behind the stories. When he contacted Janet Katz, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at Old Dominion University, and one of the authors of the study cited during the January 28 news conference, he found: Janet Katz, professor of sociology and criminal justice at Old Dominion and one of the authors of that study, said “that’s not what we found at all. “One of the most notable findings, she said, was that an increase of emergency room admissions “was not associated with the occurrence of football games in general, nor with watching a team lose.” When they looked at win days alone, however, they found that the number of women admitted for gunshot wounds, stabbings, assaults, falls, lacerations and wounds from being hit by objects was slightly higher than average. But certainly not 40 percent. “These are interesting but very tentative findings, suggesting what violence there is from males after football may spring not from a feeling of defensive insecurity, which you’d associate with a loss, but from the sense of empowerment following a win. We found that significant. But it certainly doesn’t support what those women are saying in Pasadena,” Katz said. Likewise, Ringle checked the claim made by Dobisky Associates (the organization that had mailed warnings to women advising them not to stay at home with their husbands on Super Bowl Sunday) that “Super Bowl Sunday is the one day in the year when hot lines, shelters, and other agencies that work with battered women get the most reports and complaints of domestic violence.” Dobisky’s source for this quote was Charles Patrick Ewing, a professor at the University at Buffalo, but Professor Ewing told Ringle he’d never said it: “I don’t think anybody has any systematic data on any of this,” said Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist and author of “Battered Women Who Kill.”Yet Ewing is quoted in the release from Dobisky Associates declaring “Super Bowl Sunday is one day in the year when hot lines, shelters and other agencies that work with battered women get the most reports and complaints of domestic violence.” “I never said that,” Ewing said. “I don’t know that to be true.” Told of Ewing’s response, Frank Dobisky acknowledged that the quote should have read “one of the days of the year.” That could mean one of many days in the year. In addition, Ringle learned that Linda Gorov, the Boston Globe reporter who’d written that women’s shelters and hotlines are “flooded with more calls from victims [on Super Bowl Sunday] than on any other day of the year” hadn’t even seen the study she’d cited in support of that statement but had merely been told about it by Linda Mitchell, the FAIR representative who was present at the January 28 news conference that had kicked off the whole issue. Did any evidence back up the assertion that Super Bowl Sunday was the leading day for domestic violence? When the Washington Post‘s Ringle attempted to follow the chain by contacting Linda Mitchell of FAIR, Mitchell said her source had been Lenore Walker, the Denver psychologist who’d appeared on “Good Morning America” the day after the news conference. Ms. Walker’s office referred Ringle to Michael Lindsey, another Denver psychologist who was also an authority on battered women. Mr. Lindsey told Ringle that “I haven’t been any more successful than you in tracking down any of this” and asked, “You think maybe we have one of these myth things here?” The upshot? It turned out that Super Bowl Sunday in 1993 (as in other years) was not a significantly different day for those who monitor domestic abuse hotlines and staff battered women’s shelters:  Those who work with the victims of domestic violence in Connecticut reported no increase in cases [on the day after the Super Bowl], after a barrage of publicity on the potential link between Super Bowl gatherings and family violence. An increase in domestic violence predicted for Super Bowl Sunday did not happen in Columbus, authorities said, and others nationwide said women’s rights activists were spreading the wrong message. Despite some pregame hype about the “day of dread” for some women, Columbus-area domestic violence counselors said that [Super Bowl] Sunday, although certainly violent for some women, was relatively routine. So, on what day of the year is domestic violence against women most prevalent, if not Super Bowl Sunday? It appears domestic violence doesn’t peak on any one specific day, but it does rise at  particular times of the year. For example, a 2006 study published in the Handbook of Sports and Media that examined over 1.3 million domestic violence police reports from every day of the year in 15 NFL cities found only a very small rise in domestic violence dispatches on (or just after) Super Bowl Sunday, but nearly a quintupling of domestic violence police dispatch reports around major holidays such as Christmas. A 2007 study that analyzed patterns of women fleeing domestic abuse found that the highest intake rates of women with children at shelters coincided not with Super Bowl Sunday, but with breaks in the school calendar such as Christmas vacation, spring break, and summer vacation (although that study surveyed when women most often fled from their abusers rather than when they actually experienced the abuse that prompted them to flee). The weeks and months after the 1993 Super Bowl saw a fair amount of backpedaling by those who had propagated the Super Bowl Sunday violence myth, but as usual the retractions and corrections received far less attention than the sensational-but-false stories everyone wanted to believe, and the bogus Super Bowl statistic remains a widely-cited and believed piece of misinformation. As Sommers concluded, “How a belief in that misandrist canard can make the world a better place for women is not explained.”",1
"""A Democrat opposed to an abortion-related measure suggested that a snip exclusive to men has proved less safe than an abortion. Rep. Mary González of Clint asked the proposal’s author, Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, in May 2017 floor debate: """"First and foremost, did you know that an abortion procedure is actually... safer than a vasectomy?"""" Capriglione, R-Southlake, replied that he hadn’t researched complications from procedures other than abortion and he also doesn’t believe all outcomes of abortion procedures in Texas are currently reported. His House Bill 2962 requires hospitals to submit reports to the state on abortion complications. Capriglione added: """"Not all medical procedures are equally important."""" Maybe not. Still, are abortions safer than vasectomies? Representative cites Texas figures, Kentucky story A González aide, Andrea Chevalier, said by email the legislator based her abortion-vasectomy safety claim on figures in a Texas Tribune news story and a Kentucky report. The cited June 2016 news story says that according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, fewer than 1 percent of Texas abortions in 2014 resulted in any complication to the woman. The story says the overall number of abortions in Texas had dropped to 54,902 from 63,849 in 2013 in the wake of changes in law, advanced by Republicans, expected to drive down the number of abortions by imposing hospital-level safety standards for clinics and requiring physician-providers to hold admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Chevalier said that according to a 2006 article by two Kentucky physicians, the incidence of complications such as infection and bleeding from vasectomies can be as high as 15 percent. The article, published in American Family Physician, includes a chart indicating that how a man’s scrotum is penetrated to begin a vasectomy can result in different complication rates. """"No-scalpel vasectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of complications (i.e., bleeding and infection) compared with the incision technique,"""" the article says. The chart, citing three studies published from 1990 through 2002, shows varied complication rates of 0.2 percent to 15.9 percent--and also wide variations in the results:     SOURCE: Study, """"Vasectomy: An Update,"""" American Family Physician, Dec. 15, 2016 (accessed May 15, 2017) We tried to reach the lead author of the update, Tennessee physician Paul Dassow, and didn’t hear back. We turned next to our own research. Abortion complications When we queried DSHS officials about complications due to abortions or vasectomies, spokesman Chris Van Deusen said by email the state doesn’t track fall-out from vasectomies. Van Deusen otherwise pointed us to agency-posted counts indicating that 54,310 Texas residents had abortions in the state in 2015. A separate chart says 52,938 abortion procedures led to no reported complications with 25 procedures resulting in complications, including 10 hemorrhages--which breaks out to a complication rate of less than one-tenth of 1 percent:         ^^ Abortions that took place outside of Texas. SOURCE: Chart on web page, """"Selected Characteristics of Induced Terminations of Pregnancy, Texas Residence, 2015,"""" Texas Department of State Health Services, last updated March 22, 2017 (accessed May 15, 2017) For national perspective, we emailed Rebecca Wind of the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health and abortion rights nonprofit. Wind answered by pointing out the institute’s January 2017 """"fact sheet,"""" which states a first-trimester abortion carries a risk of less than 0.05 percent of """"major complications that might need hospital care."""" A footnote notes a California study, published in 2013, that tallied a total of six major complications after 11,487 abortions. The study said complications of any kind--mostly minor--occurred 1.3 percent of the time. Also to our email inquiry, Barbara Tims of the Texas Medical Association pointed out a 2015 review of 57 studies of abortion complications published from 1980 through April 2015. With few exceptions, the review said, 1 percent or fewer first-trimester abortions resulted in """"cervical laceration needing sutures or hemorrhage that required medical management."""" Also, the report said, physicians who provided antibiotics to women after an abortion said that less than 2 percent of the patients developed infections. The researchers wrote: """"Major complications following first-trimester aspiration abortion were very rare. Unanticipated abdominal procedures and hemorrhage requiring transfusion occurred in ≤0.1% of abortions, and the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization to treat major complications was less than <0.5% in most studies reviewed. Vasectomy complications Wind said the institute doesn’t have expertise on vasectomy complications. But she helped us track down a 2005 analysis of available worldwide evidence for a British medical journal that said: """"Vasectomy, though safe and relatively simple, requires a high level of expertise to minimize complications."""" An accompanying chart indicates a 2 percent chance of hematoma, meaning swelling due to blood clotting. """"The incidence of hematoma formation,"""" the article states, """"seems to correlate with the surgical experience. The hematoma rate was 4.6% for those performing 1–10 vasectomies per year, as against 1.6% for those performing 11–50 vasectomies a year,"""" the article states, footnoting a U.S. study published in 1987. On the high end, the chart shows an average 3.4 percent chance of infection which the article says includes wound, urinary and epididymal infection. Separately, Tims of the TMA pointed out a July 2016 article from the Canadian Urological Association, footnoted to studies from 1984 through 2007, describing varied complication rates from vasectomies. The article states: """"Men must be informed about wound care and the potential for early complications: infection (0.2‒1.5%), bleeding or hematoma (4‒20%), and primary surgical failure (0.2‒5%). Men should also be made aware of late complications: chronic scrotal pain (1‒14%) and delayed vasectomy failure (0.05‒1%)."""" We also queried the American Urological Association; by email, spokesman Brandon Corbett guided us to its """"Guideline"""" for physicians, last amended in 2015, which states: """"The rates of surgical complications"""" from vasectomies """"such as symptomatic hematoma and infection are 1-2%. These rates vary with the surgeon's experience and the criteria used to diagnose these conditions."""" Our ruling González said an """"abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy."""" Both procedures rarely have complications, a clarification missing from this declaration. That said, abortion procedures appear to have lower complication rates. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""",0
"""Undercover videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discuss harvesting fetal tissue appall state Sen. Dick Black, R-Loudoun. A staunch opponent of abortion, Black is seeking to link the controversy to his Democratic opponent this fall, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician. McCabe """"supports selling late term abortions for bigger body parts,"""" Black tweeted on July 28. He renewed the charge on Aug. 4, tweeting that McCabe """"supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable."""" So we decided to examine Black’s charge. Let’s start with some background. The controversy over fetal parts erupted last month when the Center for Medical Progress, a conservative group that opposes abortion, released a nine-minute video secretly taped during a 2014 lunch with Deborah Nucatola, Planned Parenthood’s senior director of medical services. The center says the tape shows Nucatola talking about performing partial-birth abortions to keep body parts intact in order to """"sell"""" them. The video put Planned Parenthood on the defensive and ignited Republican calls to end federal funding for the group and for investigations into its practices. Planned Parenthood provides a wide array of health services to women -- 97 percent of which are not related to abortions. The organization has denounced the secret taping as a misleading campaign by anti-abortion activists. Officials of the group say fetal tissues are integral to medical research and that the organization does not profit from their sale. Allegations by Black and others that profits were made raise legal questions. Federal law bars clinics from selling fetal tissue for gain. It’s legal, however, for clinics to donate the tissue for scientific research and receive reimbursement for their """"reasonable"""" costs in providing the tissue. Cecile Richards, CEO of Planned Parenthood, has said the organization’s clinics don’t sell fetal tissue for profit but do provide it for research and are reimbursed for their collection costs. In the video, Nucatola discusses fees of $30 to $100 per specimen provided. Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, told PolitiFact National that the fees Nucatola discusses don’t appear geared to making a profit. Many of the sales are made to brokers -- middlemen who process the tissue and then sell it to researchers at significant markups. A vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells, for example, can sell for about $24,000. The brokers say their prices reflect their high costs of buying medical equipment and employing skilled technicians. Now, let’s get back to Black’s claim that McCabe supports selling fetal tissue for profit. Chris Lore, Black’s legislative assistant, told us the senator’s statement isn’t based on any statement from McCabe explicitly supporting the practice. Instead, Lore said, it’s implicit by the support she’s received from Planned Parenthood.The group has endorsed McCabe and has given her a 100 percent rating. Lore also noted McCabe has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia. In addition to those endorsements, Lore noted that amid the controversy, McCabe was quoted in a newspaper saying she still supports Planned Parenthood. """"You take those two facts into consideration and it seems her position is pretty clear,"""" Lore said. Lore forwarded a copy of a Loudoun Times-Mirror story in which McCabe was asked about whether she still welcomed Planned Parenthood’s support in the wake of the controversy. """"I'm a doctor, and I take care of patients, including women,"""" McCabe was quoted as saying. """"Women need health care choices and Planned Parenthood provides that. That's kind of the end of it for me."""" We contacted Lore a second time for more information. After we spoke with him, Black posted this message on Twitter: """"PolitiFact is desperate to give cover to @DrJillMcCabe to give cover for supporting late term abortions. #MediaLies #PPSellsBabyParts."""" We also reached out to McCabe to see what her position was on late term abortions and selling tissue for a profit. We heard back from Kyle Sutton, her campaign manager. """"Jill McCabe does not support late term abortions, but as a doctor she does understand that there are unfortunately circumstances where a pregnancy proceeding to full-term is not in the best health interest of either a mother, or child,"""" Sutton wrote in an email. What about selling fetal tissue for profit? """"Jill does not support selling fetal tissue for profit, the same way she does not support any illegal activities, because they're illegal,"""" Sutton wrote. We also asked McCabe if she supports Planned Parenthood providing tissue for research at cost, without a profit. """"As a doctor, Jill McCabe understands life-saving medical research,"""" her campaign manager wrote in an email. In an Aug. 1 story in the Washington Post story said McCabe said she had seen the Planned Parenthood videos and found them """"concerning."""" But the newspaper also quoted her saying that """"Planned Parenthood is an important organization that provides vital services."""" Our ruling Sen. Dick Black says McCabe, """"supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable."""" McCabe indicates she supports late term abortions in instances when it is """"in the best health interest"""" of the mother or child. She says she opposes the sale of fetal tissue for profit. Black links McCabe’s qualified support for late term abortions to what he says is an effort to profit from the sale of """"large baby parts."""" In effect, he’s accusing his opponent of supporting an illegal practice because U.S. law bans the sale of fetal tissue for profit. It’s incumbent of Black to prove his inflammatory claim and he offers nothing but speculation.""",1
"""Donald Trump turned to polling data to justify his proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States. """"According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population,"""" the Republican presidential candidate said in a Dec. 7 statement. """"Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad, and 51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to shariah."""" There’s a lot packed into that quote, but we decided to focus on Trump’s claim that 25 percent of Muslims polled by the Center for Security Policy agree that global jihad justifies violence against Americans. While the study Trump cited does exist, it’s not at all clear that it supports his argument that """"there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population."""" There are several important problems with the survey that call into question whether the results are representative of the entire U.S. Muslim population. Trump’s poll The Center for Security Policy, a hawkish think tank, surveyed 600 Muslims and released findings in June under the headline, """"Poll of U.S. Muslims Reveals Ominous Levels Of Support For Islamic Supremacists’ Doctrine of Shariah, Jihad."""" Among the findings is 25 percent of respondents agreed either slightly or strongly with the statement """"Violence against Americans here in the United States can be justified as part of the global jihad."""" About 64 percent disagreed. The first problem with the Center for Security policy poll has to do with methodology. It was an online, opt-in survey, which tend to produce less reliable samples because respondents choose to participate. In traditional polling methods, everyone in a population has a chance of being selected for the survey, meaning the results generally reflect the country’s demographics. Numerous respected polling groups, like Survey Monkey, use opt-in surveys, said Christopher C. Hull, a former adjunct professor at Georgetown University who now works with the Center for Security Policy and answered an inquiry from PolitiFact on the group’s behalf. He added that the method is useful for reaching small populations, such as U.S. Muslims, who only make up about 1 percent of the population. Hull did caution, however, that """"one cannot extrapolate directly from an online, opt-in survey to the broader U.S. population."""" One notable finding buried in the full survey data: It found that 23 percent of the U.S. Muslims surveyed said they are """"not at all familiar with"""" the terrorist group known as the Islamic State, and 18 percent said they are not familiar with al-Qaida. Experts said it seems illogical that such a large percentage of American Muslims would not have knowledge of the two groups. """"The al-Qaida number seems entirely implausible and likely a canary in a coal mine as to the unrepresentativeness of this survey,"""" said David Dutwin, executive vice president and chief methodologist at SSRS, a research firm. There may be further problems with the poll, including the reality that many American Muslims are immigrants and not fluent in English, and that the survey asked leading questions with limited response choices, according to a critique by the Washington Post’s Philip Bump. It’s also worth noting that the head of the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney, has articulated a variety of theories about Muslim extremists that verge on conspiracy, such as the idea that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the United States government and the false narrative that President Barack Obama is Muslim. Robert Oldendick, executive director of the Institute for Public Service and Policy Research at the University of South Carolina, reviewed the survey methodology made available by the Center for Security Policy but said he still didn’t have enough information to assess whether it’s a good or bad poll. The group has not disclosed how the surveyors targeted participants and what the response rate was. """"I would view these results very cautiously,"""" Oldendick said. """"It may be right, but it may not be. But the information to identify the quality of the sample is just not there."""" Compared with Pew Trump also mentioned research by the Pew Research Center as support for his proposal. On a key point, the results of the Center for Security Policy study diverge from the results of a 2011 Pew Research study, a traditional telephone survey of 1,033 U.S. Muslims. The methodology of the Pew poll, and the organization’s reputation, is considered solid by public-opinion experts. The Pew survey asked whether """"suicide bombing/other violence against civilians is justified to defend Islam from its enemies."""" Just 1 percent said it is """"often"""" justified, while 12 percent said it is """"sometimes"""" or """"rarely"""" justified. Eighty-one percent said it is """"never"""" justified. According to Pew in 2011, about 13 percent of American Muslims said they believe that violence in the name of Islam is justifiable. That’s half the rate of the Center for Security Policy finding of 25 percent. The 2011 Pew study also found that a """"significant minority"""" -- 21 percent -- of American Muslims feel that there is a great deal or a fair amount of support for extremism in the American Muslim community. The Center for Security Policy survey results do not directly back up Trump’s proposal to stop Muslims from entering the United States, said Kellyanne Conway, president of the Polling Company, which conducted the survey on the center’s behalf. """"We did not -- nor would we -- ask whether the U.S. should ban all Muslims,"""" she said. The Center for Security Policy poll has touched a nerve because it """"asked questions that other polling firms are refusing to ask,"""" Hull said, defending the results. """"When people do not like the results of a poll, they attack the poll’s methodology and sponsor,"""" he said. """"This situation is no different."""" Our ruling Trump said that 25 percent of U.S. Muslims """"agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad."""" Trump is referring to a poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy. However, polling experts raise numerous questions about the validity of the poll’s results, including its """"opt-in"""" methodology and the dubiously large percentages of respondents who said they were unaware of ISIS or al-Qaida. Moreover, an official with the Center for Security Policy cautioned against generalizing the poll results to the entire Muslim-American community. Another survey, which experts consider credible, found levels about half as high as what the Center for Security Policy poll found.""",1
"In January 2019, right-leaning websites responded with outrage to what they presented as a new curricular requirement for schoolchildren in the state of California. In a viral 27 January Facebook video, the “Freedom Project’s” Duke Pesta claimed that “The state of California is now moving to mandate that kindergarten teachers teach five-year-olds 15 different genders in every single California kindergarten school.” FreedomProject’s Alex Newman joined in, calling the purported policy “absolute insanity masquerading as education,” “sick,” and an example of “the destruction of civilization”:  “The California Department of Education is working on a plan to teach kindergartners that there are at least 15 different ‘genders.’ The materials under the scheme also claim it is impossible to know whether babies are boys, girls, or something else, because they cannot talk yet. Parents will not be notified and are not allowed to opt their children out of the indoctrination sessions.” That Freedom Project article carried the headline “California Wants to Teach Kindergartners There are 15 Genders” and cited an earlier report from the right-leaning FaithWire website headlined “15 Genders? California Educators Push to Force Progressive Ideology on Elementary Students,” adding that: “California elementary school students could soon be the targets of progressive sexual indoctrination if new health guidelines are approved. The guidelines, listed under the California Department of Education’s proposed Health Education Framework, include educational resources that teach children to reject gender stereotypes and embrace a rainbow of possible gender options. One recommended book called Who Are You? teaches that there are at least 15 genders, and that it’s impossible to determine whether a baby is a boy, a girl or something else.” In reality, FreedomProject and FaithWire’s coverage of the guidelines was grossly misleading, as a brief examination of the guidelines revealed. The Health Education Framework (HEF) is a lengthy document created by the California State Board of Education (SBE) and designed to set out various policies and guidelines on several areas relating to the health, well-being, and development of K-12 students. In January 2019, the SBE updated and revised the HEF for the year ahead, and as part of that effort, the document was put through a process of public feedback and consultation. As of 28 January, the draft of the HEF was around 820 pages long and had nine chapters. In one section of Chapter 3, the document set out guidelines for educating first-grade students (not “kindergartners,” as FreedomProject falsely claimed) about growth and development, and a sub-section called “Partnering with the family” made the following suggestions (on page 70): At this young age, it is important for students to recognize parents, guardians, caretakers, and other trusted adults as resources for information on growth and development…Setting a foundation for dialogue at this early age can establish a comfortable rapport between students and their parents, guardians, or caretakers as they encounter more complex subjects related to growth and development. Parents, guardians, or caretakers receive a handout with suggestions on how to initiate a conversation on growth and development with their child. Books such as It’s Not the Stork! A Book About Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families and Friends by Robie H. Harris (2008) or Who Are You? : The Kids Guide to Gender Identity by Brook Pessin-Whedbee (2017) can be shared together. So FreedomProject’s Pesta made two substantive factual errors within the first sentence of that group’s viral Facebook video, claiming “The state of California is now moving to mandate that kindergarten teachers teach five-year-olds 15 different genders in every single California kindergarten school.” In reality, the relevant section of the guidelines related to first-graders, not kindergartners, and provided recommended reading materials for parents, not teachers. Pessin-Whedbee’s book Who Are You? addresses issues surrounding gender identity among children and advises that an individual child is best-placed to decide his or her own gender identity, which the book distinguishes from “the sex assigned to you at birth, male or female.” Parents and adults “make a guess” at a baby’s gender, the book says, “by looking at their bodies.” Pages 16-21 of Who Are You? read as follows: Some people say there are only two genders. But there are really many genders. You are who you say you are, because YOU know you best. For some people, the grown-ups guessed right about their body and their gender. This is called cisgender — when someone’s identity matches their sex assigned at birth. And for some people, there are more than just two choices. These are just a few words people use: trans, genderqueer, non-binary, gender fluid, transgender, gender neutral, agender, neutrois, bigender, third gender, two-spirit … and there are even more words people are using to describe their experience. This is called the gender spectrum. It’s not clear what the source was for the figure of “at least 15 genders.” Who Are You? mentioned 12 descriptive terms for the concept of gender identity, not 12 (or 15) separate and distinct gender identities. The other suggested book, It’s Not the Stork!, addresses issues around how babies are made, how children grow and develop, and how they can become familiar with their own bodies and understand personal physical boundaries, among other questions. Interestingly, that book only mentions and recognizes two genders, male and female, and many pages are dedicated to explaining to children how “boys and girls” differ — especially anatomically — and the ways in which they are similar or the same. Although Robie H. Harris’ and Michael Emberley’s book makes a point of showing children that gender stereotypes are not set in stone, it does not differentiate between birth-assigned sex and gender identity, stating: “One of the ways that you can tell boys and girls apart is by their bodies. Girls’ and boys’ bodies are mostly — but not exactly — the same. Girls and women have a vagina. Boys and men have a penis. These are some of the special parts of our bodies that make a person a boy or a man — or a girl or a woman.” Although the book acknowledges same-sex relationships and parenthood (“Some families … have two mommies, some have two daddies”), it does not mention or acknowledge gender fluidity or transgender identity, stating more than once that “Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men.” These explanations go against those contained in Who Are You?, which explicitly states “there are really many genders,” as opposed to the two (male/female, boy/girl, man/woman) outlined in It’s Not the Stork! This is significant because the same sentence in Chapter 3 of the draft HEF suggests both books to parents to read with their children. However, neither the FaithWire nor FreedomProject coverage of the document mentioned the second book. This was a conspicuous omission that created the grossly misleading impression that the California Department of Education was engaged in an effort to force only one view of gender identity on parents and children. Clearly, that was not the case. After all, if the inclusion of Who Are You? in the draft framework meant, as its critics claimed, that the education department was attempting to “indoctrinate” children into the view that “there are really many genders,” then as a matter of logical necessity the inclusion of It’s Not the Stork! in the same sentence and the same section of the draft framework would mean the department was also attempting to “indoctrinate” children into the view that “Girls and women have a vagina, boys and men have a penis” — the very same viewpoint that FreedomProject and FaithWire purported to be defending in the first place. Perhaps the most serious factual error in FreedomProject and FaithWire’s coverage of the draft 2019 HEF was their claim that the curriculum (which they said included the book Who Are You?) was mandatory, and that parents and guardians who did not approve of it had no recourse. In their article, FaithWire wrote: “What about parents who would prefer that their children not be exposed to errant gender ideology? Unfortunately, there would be no opt-out option.” In his article, Newman claimed that “Parents will not be notified and are not allowed to opt their children out of the indoctrination sessions.” In FreedomProject’s viral Facebook video, Pesta solemnly warned: “Moms and dads will be utterly unable to opt their kids out of this. You will not be able to hold your five-year-old kindergarten kid home if they’re teaching ’15 genders,’ you’re going to have to — under the peril of the law — compel your kids to attend this.” That claim was utterly false. As we’ve established — and as even a brief check of the draft framework would have revealed to FreedomProject — Who Are You? was recommended as reading material for parents, not teachers, and the document said only that the two books listed there “can be shared” between parents and their children, not that they must be shared. A spokesperson for the California Department of Education confirmed the optional nature of the recommendations, writing to us in an email that: “The purpose of the framework is to provide guidance for teachers and administrators. There is nothing mandatory about the guidance offered in the framework … LEAs [school districts] are not obligated to use any suggested curriculum or handouts referenced in the framework.”",1
"Not long ago, Nabipur was a quiet farming village in northern India. Now the village is home to at least a dozen furnaces burning a steady stream of tires to make low-quality oil in a process known as pyrolysis. Global trade in waste tires has almost doubled in the past five years, mainly to developing countries like India and Malaysia, according to customs data provided to the United Nations. Britain is currently the largest exporter, followed by Italy and the United States. India is by far the biggest buyer, accounting for 32% of global imports last year, up from 7% five years ago, the U.N. data shows. Many of the tires are sent to recycling operations that comply with emissions and waste disposal regulations. But there is also a vast trade to backyard pyrolysis operations that do not, according to local authorities. In May, Reuters revealed that a mass poisoning in southern Malaysia had links to companies engaged in pyrolysis. Using unpublished customs data and interviews with dozens of industry sources, Reuters documented a growing international trade in waste tires that pollute the communities that host them, according to local authorities and health experts. For many developed countries, shipping tires abroad is cheaper than recycling them domestically. That helped drive international trade in rubber waste to nearly 2 million tonnes in 2018, equivalent to 200 million tyres, from 1.1 million tonnes in 2013. The trade has also been fed by ravenous fuel demand for industrial furnaces in countries like India, the emergence of inexpensive Chinese pyrolysis equipment, and weak regulations worldwide. FACTBOX on the tyre trade:  Tires are not defined as hazardous under the Basel Convention, which governs trade in dangerous waste, meaning there are few restrictions on trading them internationally unless specified by the importing country. In most countries, including China and the United States, the majority of scrap tires are handled domestically and dumped in landfills, recycled or used as fuel in factories producing products like cement and paper. (GRAPHIC: Recycling and reuse of tires - here)  Pyrolysis supporters say the process can be a relatively clean way of disposing of tires and turning them into useful fuel. However, controlling emissions and processing waste residue from the burning of a product that is made up a wide range of chemicals, and synthetic and natural rubber is expensive and difficult to make profitable on a mass scale. State-of-the-art plants can cost tens of millions of dollars, whereas basic Chinese-made pyrolysis equipment is available from online retailers for as little as $30,000. An Indian government audit found that as of July 2019 there were 637 licensed pyrolysis plants countrywide, of which 270 were not complying with environmental standards and 116 had been shut down. The audit said most operators used rudimentary equipment that exposed workers to fine carbon particles and led to dust, oil and air pollution leaking into the plant and surroundings. Industry sources say several hundred more unlicensed pyrolysis businesses are operating across India. Pyrolysis plants have mushroomed in the southern Malaysian state of Johor over the last decade, industry sources said, where they supply fuel for ships. At one plant visited by Reuters near the Johor town of Kulai, Bangladeshi immigrants covered in carbon dust shovelled tires imported from Australia and Singapore into a Chinese-made furnace. They lived onsite in a hut next to the kilns. “People don’t know where old tyres go,” said the owner, who gave his name only as Sam. “But if my factory doesn’t exist, where will the tires go?” He said he had a license to operate. Reuters could not verify this. The environmental impact of pyrolysis in places like India and Malaysia is making some exporting countries take notice. Australia, a major exporter of tyres to Southeast Asia and India, said in August it would ban waste exports, including tires, although it did not give a timeline. Australia was “aware of allegations of unsustainable processing of waste tires in some importing countries” and did not want “to be part of such practices”, said a spokesman for Trevor Evans, the official who oversees waste reduction. Burning tyres without adequate emissions controls can release numerous toxic chemicals and gases into the environment, as well as particulates, said Lalit Dandona, head of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, a group of research bodies mapping health issues across India. (GRAPHIC: What's in a tire? - here)  He said the short-term effects for those exposed to smoke from burning tires included skin irritation and lung infections and that prolonged exposure could result in heart attacks and lung cancer. Other government bodies worldwide, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have made similar conclusions. In a 1997 report, the EPA said emissions from burning tires included dioxins, sulphur oxides and a range of metals including mercury and arsenic. Many of the tires that end up in Indian villages like Nabipur start their lives in Britain. Indian waste tire imports from Britain alone in 2018 amounted to 263,000 tonnes - 13% of the total volume of tires traded worldwide - compared with 48,000 tonnes in 2013. (GRAPHIC: Where India imports its waste tires - here)  Most European countries require tyre manufacturers and suppliers to organize tire collection and treatment, meaning there are more home-grown recycling operations. There are no such requirements in Britain, however, which means that small firms can easily obtain licenses to collect waste tires and sell them abroad. Britain’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said it fully implements the rules of the Basel Convention but needs to do more about waste tires. DEFRA said it planned to make producers more responsible for old tires, as well as increase monitoring of shipments. (GRAPHIC: Top tire waste importing countries - here)  Once in India, the tires are dispersed between recyclers who shred them for use in road-building or sports fields, firms that burn them as cheap fuel to make cement or bricks, and legal and illegal pyrolysis plants, importers and exporters said. India’s Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association estimates that most imported waste tyres end up in pyrolysis plants, according to the group’s deputy director, Vinay Vijayvargia. Faced with a growing backlash from environmental groups and residents living near pyrolysis plants, India is considering banning all but the most sophisticated operations. The country’s environmental court is expected to rule on the proposed ban in January. Six years ago, there were no pyrolysis plants in Nabipur, 70 miles south of New Delhi. Now there are 10, with most operating at night to avoid scrutiny, residents said. Reuters visited three small plants in the village. At one, tires embossed with ‘Made in Germany’ and ‘Made in U.S.A.’ lay strewn on the floor and thick sludge seeped from pipes protruding from incineration drums. Most tires used for vehicles in India are made domestically. Workers wore no safety equipment, and their skin and clothes were covered in black soot. The owner, Pankaj, said a trader sells him tires imported from abroad. Villagers said they have suffered from breathing difficulties and eye and throat infections since the plants began expanding, and farmers had found black dust in their soil. Reuters could not independently verify the claims. It was also not possible to verify if the operations were licensed. “Used tires are not available locally, so they import from abroad,” said Shiva Choudhary, a businessman who leases out construction equipment in Nabipur. “They clean their own country and dump their garbage on us.”",0
"On 25 June 2018, a Russian mining company named Uralasbest, which is one of the world’s largest producers of asbestos, posted a message of support for President Trump on their official Facebook and VK (a Russian version of Facebook) pages. The post included photographs of packed asbestos material adorned with the face of Trump and the text “Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.”  Asbestos is a mineral that was once widely used in construction projects for its fire resistant properties, but research has since linked it to a variety of cancers, most notably lung cancer and mesothelioma. The non-profit health and environmental protection Environmental Working Group, who first called attention to the Uralasbest post, provided an English translation of the text that was shared alongside the image: “Donald is on our side! … He supported the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who stated that his agency would no longer deal with negative effects potentially derived from products containing asbestos. Donald Trump supported a specialist and called asbestos ‘100% safe after application. '” These images, as they were posted to the official social media accounts of Uralasbest, are genuine. Also genuine is President Trump’s support of the asbestos industry. Trump once opined, in his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback, that efforts to reduce and regulate asbestos (a material he claimed was “100% safe” once applied) in building construction were part of a mob-led conspiracy: “I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented.”",0
"Biogen had announced in March that it would terminate two large clinical trials of aducanumab because they were likely to fail. Within weeks, a group of company researchers set out to understand what went wrong. As they studied data from a larger pool of patients who received the drug, they began to question that conclusion. In the months that followed, Biogen kept its own trial investigators and committee overseeing the trial in the dark about the possibility that some patients had benefited from high doses of the therapy, researchers told Reuters. The company said it brought in outside Alzheimer’s experts and statisticians to help it parse the new findings, and sought feedback from U.S. regulators on whether it could be considered for approval. The result, made public on Tuesday, was an astounding reversal. Biogen will seek U.S. approval for the therapy early next year, once again raising hopes for patients suffering from the brain-wasting disease. Biogen shares gained 27% on investor hopes for a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. The risks for Biogen remain high. Wall Street analysts cast doubt on whether Biogen’s analysis would pass muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration without an additional years-long trial to confirm the findings. Several Alzheimer’s researchers questioned why one trial appeared to succeed, while another with the same design failed. Many experts say they are reserving judgment until Biogen presents more detailed data in December. Company executives are reluctant to characterize their interactions with the FDA, but said they worked closely with the agency until they were confident in the findings. Biogen was only willing to move forward with seeking approval for aducanumab after meeting twice with FDA. The final decision was made immediately after the second of those meetings, which took place on Monday, Biogen officials said. For the FDA “to say it’s reasonable to file an application after two extensive discussions with them, formal meetings as well as a number of informal discussions, I think it’s significant,” Biogen research chief Al Sandrock said in an interview. Biogen’s earlier decision to terminate the trials was viewed as the final nail in the coffin for the so-called “amyloid hypothesis” - the theory that removing a protein associated with Alzheimer’s could stave off this fatal form of dementia. Many similar drugs had previously failed. Globally, 131 million people are expected to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s by 2050, up from 50 million today. Any successful treatment could be worth $10 billion or more in annual sales, industry analysts say. The March announcement also raised concerns about a second therapy, BAN2401, that works in a similar way. Biogen is partnering with Japan’s Eisai on both drugs. Ivan Cheung, Eisai’s chief executive, said in an interview that he expects aducanumab’s revival will energize enrollment in a late-stage study of BAN2401, with results expected in 2022. Patients taking the highest dose of BAN2401 showed some encouraging results in a midstage trial last year. “That’s why in the Phase III trial, we are only studying the highest dose,” Cheung said. The two aducanumab trials - Engage and Emerge - started a month apart in 2015. Each had about 1,640 patients. As they progressed, the company made changes in the trial that expanded the number of patients who received a higher dose. As part of a planned “futility analysis,” outside monitors reviewed half of the data as of December 2018 to determine whether the drug had a reasonable chance of success. “So many of us felt that this might be the drug that would cross the finish line,” said Dr. Sharon Cohen, director of the Toronto Memory program, who led one of the studies. In March, she received the answer: the therapy looked like a dud. However, patients continued to receive treatment in the interim. Cohen believes the fact that some patients got a higher dose for longer helped swing results in the Emerge study, which ultimately showed a benefit. A month after announcing the failure, Biogen began analyzing results from both trials, including additional data from patients who later completed treatment. By the time Biogen had its first FDA meeting in mid-June, the company knew that one of the studies had succeeded, and understood that dose was important, said Samantha Budd Haeberlein, who runs Biogen’s Alzheimer’s program. “We did a great deal of analysis in close contact with the FDA to really understand what occurred in these trials,” Haeberlein said. “It took several months to work through that.”  During that entire stretch, Cohen said she and fellow investigators were waiting to hear why the drug had failed. They expected a presentation in July during the Alzheimer’s Association annual meeting, but none came. “I was completely unaware of what had been discovered until last Sunday,” said Dr. Anton Porsteinsson, a principal investigator for the trials from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Porsteinsson said Biogen asked him to sign a non-disclosure agreement before sharing the new analysis. Cohen said she first reviewed the new data on Monday in what she called a “top secret” meeting. She said the company wanted a few investigators to hear the findings ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, but had concerns about insider trading. Many still question why only one trial succeeded. “The signal from the positive trial was kind of convincing,” said Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s expert Dr. Ronald Petersen, who has been a paid adviser for Biogen. It showed a 23% reduction in a key measure of cognitive decline. “But the other study, which was meant to be identical, didn’t show it,” he said. “That’s the challenge there.”",0
"""On CNN, a panel of commentators discussed some of the health-policy issues surrounding Jimmy Kimmel’s revelation the night before that his newborn had to have surgery for a rare heart defect. In a video clip that went viral, Kimmel devoted the monologue of his ABC late-night show to telling the story of the birth of his son, Billy. Shortly after he was born, doctors discovered a serious congenital heart defect known as tetralogy of Fallot. The doctors were able to operate on Billy, and their efforts appear to be successful, though additional surgeries may eventually be needed. In addition to drawing widespread popular interest in his son’s story, Kimmel touched on the current debate over whether or how to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. In the monologue, he urged lawmakers not to return Americans to the days before the law, when a pre-existing condition -- like his son’s -- could prevent you from securing health insurance. """"If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,"""" Kimmel said. """"I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?"""" Kimmel’s monologue inspired a discussion of health care policy on a CNN segment moderated by anchor Kate Bolduan the following day. At one point, CNN commentator Margaret Hoover noted that, for all the concern about Kimmel’s situation, poor families would be less likely than a celebrity to have access to a world-class surgical team. Referring to the Kimmel surgery, she said, """"Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service. Our health care system is broken, and the poorest of us cannot afford it."""" We wondered whether she was correct, so we started contacting experts. Before we could finish our research, Hoover emailed us to say that she had misspoken. """"The point I had intended to make was that poorer families, especially those who have received health coverage under the ACA, have largely received it through Medicaid expansion, which increasingly isn't accepted at hospitals,"""" she said in an email. """"Sadly, in an emotional segment, I misspoke,"""" Hoover told us. Hoover said she realized she had said something wrong when she began seeing criticism in her Twitter mentions. Hoover tweeted a correction shortly after our email exchange: """"Correction to misspeaking w/ @KateBolduan: I accidentally said Medicaid has stopped providing ‘that kind of service.’ … Point I intended to make was that hospitals increasingly don’t accept Medicaid. … Which means poor families have a harder time getting Kimmel’s level of care already."""" For the record, the experts we contacted agreed that Medicaid has not done anything to cut off its beneficiaries from complex pediatric surgeries like the one Kimmel’s son underwent. Hoover’s initial remark on CNN was """"totally incorrect,"""" said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. In fact, she said, """"Medicaid is the major source of health insurance coverage for children’s hospitals and the specialized services they offer."""" MaryBeth Musumeci, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation, added that Medicaid covers a broad range of services for children under its Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment benefit, called EPSDT. Any state that accepts Medicaid funding must offer EPSDT to children from birth through age 21, she said. As a practical matter, this means that Medicaid must cover necessary services for children’s physical or mental health, even if that service is not covered by Medicaid for adults in that state, she said. At PolitiFact, our policy is to correct a speaker’s original misstatement while noting subsequent corrections by the speaker. Hoover, for her part, did have a point when she mentioned the relative lack of access for Medicaid beneficiaries. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while 85 percent of physicians accepted new patients with private insurance, only 69 percent accepted new patients with Medicaid. Hoover pointed to this column, by Scott W. Atlas, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, to support her point. """"People on Medicaid have more challenges accessing specialists than the privately insured, and the more high-tech and innovative, the more challenging that may be,"""" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Our ruling Hoover said that, regarding the surgery that saved Kimmel’s son, """"Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service."""" That’s wrong -- Medicaid does cover this kind of service, and indeed, the federal-state program is a key source of reimbursement for children’s hospitals. Hoover quickly acknowledged that she was wrong and tweeted a correction.""",1
"On Oct. 10, 2019, many readers came across news stories about an invasive species of fish called the snakehead fish that had been discovered in Georgia. While these stories largely dealt with wildlife officials’ attempts to eradicate the species, what caught the attention of most readers were brief mentions of this fish’s unique ability to survive on land. CNN reported: A snakehead fish that survives on land was discovered in Georgia. Officials want it dead An invasive fish species that can breathe air and survive on land has been found in Georgia for the first time. And officials are warning anyone who comes into contact with the species to kill it immediately. An angler caught the northern snakehead fish this month in a pond in Gwinnett County, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources’ Wildlife Resources Division said Tuesday. “Thanks to the quick report by an angler, our staff was able to investigate and confirm the presence of this species in this water body,” said Matt Thomas, chief of fisheries for the Wildlife Resources Division. “We are now taking steps to determine if they have spread from this water body and, hopefully, keep it from spreading to other Georgia waters.” The snakehead fish can truly survive on land. However, some readers may have been left with the impression that this species of fish can live on land for an indefinite period of time. There are approximately 21 species of snakehead fish. The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a bimodal breathing fish thanks to a lung-like labyrinth organ near its gills. The snakehead can store atmospheric oxygen in this organ and then draw from this supply as it swims. This allows the snakehead to survive in low oxygen water. This fish can also use its unique bimodal breathing ability to move between bodies of waters. The Smithsonian writes: Unlike most fish, the northern snakehead has little sacs above its gills that function almost like lungs; the fish can surface and suck air into the sacs, then draw oxygen from the stored air as it swims. The air sacs are handy for surviving in waters that are low in oxygen, and even allow the fish to survive out of water for a couple of days, as long as it doesn’t dry out. A research article published in Biology Open in 2018 elaborated on the air-breathing abilities of the snakehead:  The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a species of air-breathing fish that is widely distributed in East Asia. This fish has a peculiar accessory breathing organ, the suprabranchial chamber, by which the fish breathes air at the water’s surface using a cough-like mechanism (Ishimatsu and Itazawa, 1981; Lefevre et al., 2014), making possible short-term survival out of water (Nagata and Nakata, 1988). The suprabranchial chamber of Channa possesses a richly vascularized wall for gas exchange. It communicates with the buccopharyngeal cavity through a ventral opening guarded by a ‘shutter’ plate bone outgrowth of the first branchial arch, which can close the inhalant aperture of the suprabranchial chamber during expiration (Munshi, 1962). While a snakehead’s ability to breath air may certainly come as a surprise to many, this is not the only species of fish with this ability. Andy Turko, the co-author of a 2015 study into one such species, the mangrove rivulus, spoke to National Geographic about these amphibious fish:  Fish use gills to take in oxygen from the water. But many fish, like the mangrove rivulus, have adaptations that let them breathe air. For instance, mangrove rivulus “have specialized skin that takes on many of the roles of gills,” such as maintaining salt levels, Turko says. […] The walking catfish, a Southeast Asian native that’s invaded South Florida, has an extra organ that supports its gills and helps it take in oxygen from the air. This is not the first time that the snakehead has made national news. In 2002, there was a bit of a panic after snakeheads were found in a pond in Crofton, Maryland. The snakehead fish’s ability to survive on land, its scary-sounding name, and the fact that it is considered an invasive species, led to a full-blown media circus about the discovery as the public imagined “monster fish” stalking the woods in search of prey. The incident even inspired a couple of horror movies, such as “Frankenfish” and “Snakehead Terror”:   The snakehead can truly survive out of water for a few days. However, this fish does not have the ability to traverse long distances over land, nor is it an adept ground hunter. Whit Gibbons, professor emeritus of ecology at the University of Georgia, wrote in 2017: Young snakeheads eat a variety of zooplankton and small aquatic insects. Adults eat other fish, sometimes one-third the length of their own bodies, as well as crawfish and frogs. Snakeheads are different from most other fish, which cannot survive for long out of water. Adult northern snakeheads have gills but can also gulp air and have been documented to live out of water for up to four days. However, although a young one may travel overland for several feet, a full-grown adult is too large to move effectively, so your pet chihuahua will probably be safe if it can make it to the pet door. Here’s a video of a snakehead in Thailand as it “walks,” crawls, or wiggles its way back to the water:",0
"""Gov. Rick Perry touts Texas as a model state that escaped the recession with few battle scars and a lot of jobs, if you're looking for one. An unemployment rate significantly below the national rate is one reason folks are coming here — 1,000 people daily, according to Perry. """"I am pleased to receive the endorsement of the Southwest Movers Association, which plays a key role in supporting the more than 1,000 people who move to Texas every day,"""" he said Dec. 29. """"As our state continues to grow, I look forward to working with members and stakeholders of SMA to ensure that Texas remains a top destination for job seekers."""" Matthew Thompson, a senior writer and editor at the Office of the Governor, said the governor's staff divided the state's annual population growth by 365 days to estimate how much the population swells daily. The statistics came from the U.S. Census Bureau. Between July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009, Texas gained 478,012 more people — more than any other state (California, still boasting the biggest population overall, was second with 381,000 new people). That's about 1,300 people per day, by Thompson's calculation. But 478,000 is the net population change. It includes births as well as people relocating to Texas, after accounting for deaths and people leaving the state. So, what part of that net figure represents newcomers? With help from the U.S. Census Bureau, we learned that about 635 people come to Texas every day, on average. A census official based that number on average daily net migration from other states (393) plus average daily net migration from other countries (242). A separate estimate of the actual number of people entering the state comes from the Internal Revenue Service, which tracks the addresses of people who file taxes each year, and reports that information to the Census Bureau. The IRS found that 493,840 people switched their residence to Texas between the time they filed in 2007 and when they filed in 2008 — that's about 1,353 people each day. (The IRS' data are slightly older than the figures Perry cites as evidence for his claim.) In the end, Perry came close to getting it right, though he didn't take into account in-state births or people moving away. Statistically speaking, of course, a set number of people aren't moving to Texas every day because that number varies. But if you rely on IRS data collected in 2007 and 2008, more than 1,300 people on average were relocating here during that time frame. We rule Perry's claim , even if he wasn't using the right data as evidence.""",0
"On 16 May 2019, the entertainment website TMZ reported that former WWE wrestler Ric Flair (real name Richard Fliehr) was rushed to the hospital for a medical emergency. As Flair’s fans fretted over the news, a few opportunists started to spread false rumors about “Nature Boy’s” condition. The official-looking Twitter account @WWEUmiverse, for example, posted an image of Flair and asserted that the wrestler had passed away. This account used a handle resembling the WWE’s actual account (at @WWEUniverse) in order to fool viewers with hoax stories. The fake account misspelled “Universe” with an “m”:  The disreputable website LFRSolutions also posted a fake news story about the wrestler’s health. Shortly after Flair was hospitalized, the website published a story claiming that Flair had been declared brain dead:  WWE Ric Flair has been declared brain dead after a medical emergency led him to being hospitalized earlier today. According to several news reports, it’s unclear what medical emergency led him to the hospital to begin with but sources have now said that the wrestling legend’s is no longer functioning although his other organs are still working at this time. Ric Flair is still on a breathing machine until his family gives permission to disconnect him but as of now, he is declared brain dead, thus legally dead. LFRSolutions is not a genuine news source. This website frequently publishes misinformation, and although it does carry a disclaimer, that disclaimer is so small that most readers would need a magnifying glass to decipher it:  The disclaimer reads: “The stories posted on LFRSolutions.com are for entertainment purposes only. The stories may mimic articles found in the headlines, but rest assured they are purely satirical.” Ric Flair was hospitalized on 16 May 2019, but reports about his dying or being declared brain dead were hoaxes that originated with disreputable sources.",1
"Costs are not included. Comparing the cost of the three treatment options mentioned in the release — CT-guided pRF, CT-guided steroid injections, and lumbar disk surgery — would have been appropriate and helpful. An assumption is made that the cost of this procedure is less than a surgical intervention. This is often not the case, and “minimally” invasive approaches can cost more. The news release reports these 1-year outcomes: The terminology here is very vague. It would have been helpful to clarify what the rate and probability of “perceived recovery” mean, and how they’re measured. The release leads with a phrase we find problematic: “minimally invasive.” For many readers this connotes a quick, “safe and effective” intervention as mentioned in the release. But “minimally invasive” can potentially have more complications than a prior “more invasive” approach. No instrumentation close to the spine or its nerve roots is risk-free. Nerve damage and infection are two potential complications that should have been mentioned. This is a major weakness of the news release because the following key points are omitted: No disease mongering. Chronic lower back pain is not only very common and very difficult to treat, but it’s also one of the leading causes of disability and missed work days. Study funding is not included. A review of the meeting abstract reveals no conflicts of interest disclosed by the seven authors. The news release defines what alternatives are available for acute back pain with sciatica, including pain medications, cortisteroids and surgery. It details outcomes in patients treated with steroid injections compared with pRF. It’s not made clear for readers if this is an experimental therapy, or if it is widely available. The procedure is, in fact, a refined technique of an older procedure. The release doesn’t explain what’s novel about the research. The rPF procedure has been used extensively for a variety of chronic pain conditions for years. The headline is misleading. The source of back pain is usually unknown and even if an imaging study demonstrates a disc herniation it is usually not the identifiable cause of the pain. The title could lead people to seek treatment for their imaging finding but not resolve their pain. It’s unjustified to make broad claims as found in the headline based on unpublished data.",1
"A new variant on anti-vaccine paranoia emerged on 26 October 2016, when a dubious news site published an article linking a vaccine to what it described as a government effort to hurt black women. The three-paragraph “story” was based on statements from “government anesthesiologist” Henry Rothschild but didn’t contain any actual quotes from that putative doctor, let alone provide any links or citations for his alleged remarks. According to Rothschild, the government “knowingly” injected black women with an epidural during childbirth the contained a birth defect-inducing vaccine called Terminar which it notes is “Spanish for terminate.” (This translations is technically true, but the verb is most often used in the context of finishing a task.) Rothschild also allegedly said that the vaccine was used between 2010 and 2014, with no accounting for the years since, or any reason identified for the furtive plot besides this bombastic claim:  Terminar was design [sic] to break down African American/Black women ovaries exposing them to different germs and multiple diseases which will likely produce a child with serious birth defects and serious illnesses. We contacted Fammtv.com to ask for more information that might substantiate their claims, but they had not responded as of the time of publication of this article. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has not published epidural use statistics for the years mentioned in the story, but a study of epidural use rates in 27 states in 2008 showed that 62 percent of Black women used epidurals during childbirth. (We have contacted the CDC seeking epidural usage rates between 2010 and 2014.) However, a 2014 study by the American Public Health Association (APHA), tracking 13.5 million live births in the U.S. between 1999 and 2007, undermines Fammtv’s allegations: the APHA study showed “much higher ocurrences” of more birth defects among American Indian/Alaska Native children (and not African-Americans) compared to white children. The existence of a drug “breaking down Black womens’ ovaries” would presumably have led to a greater incidence of birth defects being reported in African-American communities.",1
"A 38-year-old man from Quanzhou city died after being found infected earlier on Friday, Xinhua said, citing the province’s health and family planning commission. Xinhua said this was the first human case of H7N9 in Fujian this year. Separately, Xinhua said two people were infected with H7N9 in eastern Zhejiang province — a 79-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday that seven more people in China have been found to be infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu in the past week, taking to around 150 the total number of cases so far. The H7N9 bird flu emerged last year in China and has infected around 150 people there and in Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing at least 45 of them. Experts say there is no evidence as yet of any easy or sustained person-to person transmission of the strain. But an early scientific analysis of probable transmission of the new flu from person to person, published last August, gave the strongest proof yet that it can at times jump between people and so could cause a human pandemic. The WHO said the source of the human infections was still being investigated. It stressed it does not advise any special screening for people going in and out of China, nor does it recommend any travel or trade curbs.",0
"On 1 May 2017, the web site World News Daily Report (a notorious purveyor of fake news) posted an article seemingly reporting that a babysitter in Cincinnati, Ohio was admitted to a local hospital after paramedics found a toddler wedged in her vagina: Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV. “The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas, but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the woman’s vagina.” The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. After being transported to a hospital, where doctors successfully removed the baby (the article continues), Brown confessed to “deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity” and was charged by police with “aggravated child neglect.” Not a word of which is true. As we have noted on many occasions (and as World News Daily Report states on its own disclaimer page), all of the content on the site is fictional:",1
"Just as urban legends and rumors eventually become attached to the most famous exemplars of the subjects they discuss (e.g., any fast food-related legend, no matter where it originates, will inevitably be told about McDonald’s), so do many of the spurious medical articles circulated on the Internet eventually become attributed to the world-renowned Johns Hopkins university, medical school, and hospitals. A putative “Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins Hospital” began as an e-mailed preface to another piece about the supposed dangers of using microwave ovens to heat food stored in plastic containers:  CANCER UPDATE FROM JOHN HOPKINS HOSPITAL, US – PLEASE READ  1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion. When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size. 2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person’s lifetime. 3. When the person’s immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors. 4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors. 5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system. 6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc. 7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs. 8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction. 9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications. 10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites. 11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply. CANCER CELLS FEED ON: a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be Manuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts. Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in color. Better alternative is Bragg’s aminos or sea salt. b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened soya milk cancer cells are being starved. c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish, and a little chicken rather than beef or pork. Meat also contains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer. d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment. About 20% can be from cooked food including beans. Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including bean sprouts) and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C). e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high caffeine. Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it. 12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrefied and leads to more toxic buildup. 13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body’s killer cells to destroy the cancer cells. 14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence, Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body’s own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body’s normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells. 15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger, unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life. 16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells. Both of those articles were said to have originated with Johns Hopkins, but neither was issued by (or had any connection to) the Johns Hopkins university or hospital, and Johns Hopkins has disclaimed the contents of both:  Information falsely attributed to Johns Hopkins called, “CANCER UPDATE FROM JOHN HOPKINS” describes properties of cancer cells and suggests ways of preventing cancer. Johns Hopkins did not publish the information, which often is an email attachment, nor do we endorse its contents. The email also contains an incorrect spelling of our institution as “John” Hopkins; whereas, the correct spelling is “Johns” Hopkins. Another hoax email that has been circulating since 2004 regarding plastic containers, bottles, wrap claiming that heat releases dioxins which cause cancer also was not published by Johns Hopkins. The web site of Johns Hopkins’ Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center also noted of the “Cancer Update” e-mail that:  It has become such a problem that the National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and individual cancer centers like the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center have posted warnings on their Web sites. Emails offering easy remedies for avoiding and curing cancer are the latest Web-influenced trend. To gain credibility, the anonymous authors falsely attribute their work to respected research institutions like Johns Hopkins. This is the case with the so-called “Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins.” The gist of this viral email is that cancer therapies of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy do not work against the disease and people should instead choose a variety of dietary strategies. Traditional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, work. The evidence is the millions of cancer survivors in the United States today who are alive because of these therapies. We recognize that treatments don’t work in every patient, or sometimes work for awhile and then stop working, and there are some cancers that are more difficult to cure than others. These problems are the focus of ongoing cancer research.",1
"The authors of “Like a virgin (mother)” - whose prose is devoid of irony - say such scientifically impossible claims show researchers must use care in interpreting self-reported behavior. Fallible memory, beliefs and wishes can cause people to err in what they tell scientists. Based on interviews with 7,870 women and girls ages 15 to 28, 45 of the 5,340 pregnancies in this group through the years - 0.8 percent - occurred in women who reported that they conceived independent of men. The figure does not include pregnancies that result from in vitro fertilization or other assisted reproductive technology. Each year, the BMJ Christmas edition publishes untraditional science papers. In addition to the report on virgin pregnancies, the latest BMJ includes papers on whether there is a local baby boom nine months after home sports teams triumph (only a small one, but statistically significant) and whether an apple a day would keep the British doctor away (yes, saving about 8,500 lives in the United Kingdom each year, about as many as would expanding the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs to everyone over 50). For the study of putative virgin pregnancies, researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill analyzed data from the thousands of teenage girls and young women who took part in the long-running National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The girls were 12 to 18 years old when they entered the study in the 1994-95 school year and were interviewed periodically about their health and behavior over 14 years, including via computer as a way to encourage them to be candid when answering questions about their sexual history. The 45 women and girls who became pregnant despite, according to what they told interviewers, being virgins at the time of conception differed in several ways from peers who acknowledged that men had had a role in their procreation. Of those who said they became pregnant as virgins, 31 percent also said they had signed chastity pledges; 15 percent of nonvirgins who became pregnant said they had signed such pledges, in which a girl vows not to have sex until she marries. The 45 self-described virgins who reported having become pregnant and the 36 who gave birth were also more likely than nonvirgins to say their parents never or rarely talked to them about sex and birth control. About 28 percent of the “virgin” mothers’ parents (who were also interviewed) indicated they didn’t have enough knowledge to discuss sex and contraception with their daughters, compared to 5 percent of the parents of girls who became pregnant and said they had had intercourse. The ostensibly chaste mothers were also less likely to know how to use condoms, according to the report. UNC biostatistician Amy Herring and public health expert Carolyn Halpern led the group. The researchers found that although the mothers in question were more likely to have boys than girls, and to be pregnant during the weeks leading up to Christmas, neither similarity to the Virgin Mary was statistically significant.",0
"Client Julius Wayne Dudley (L) reacts as volunteer Jeffrey Pierre-Paul picks his finger for a cholesterol test in the Family Van in Boston, Massachusetts August 9, 2010. REUTERS/Brian Snyder “I work from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. I don’t have time to go to the hospital. Here I can just walk in,” the 34-year-old teacher’s assistant said recently as she waited during her lunch break for a test. “I have kids to support. I can’t afford to take a day off from work.”   Santiago is one of some 3,000 people each year who visit the Family Van for free checks of their blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol level. The nonprofit clinic affiliated with Harvard University provides simple tests that can give an early warning of an impending health problem or help manage an existing condition, such as diabetes. The van — which visits six low-income neighborhoods around Boston weekly — is one of about 2,000 such mobile clinics in the United States. Advocates say the approach can help control the rising cost of health care by helping people with chronic diseases to stay out of the emergency room, often the first recourse for inner-city residents. “Our medical system in this country is focused on illness. What we are doing is helping people when they’re sick,” said Jennifer Bennet, executive director of the Family Van, which is backed by Harvard Medical School. “It would be a lot less expensive and people’s quality of life would be vastly improved if we as a society and as a country start to look at addressing these problems long before they get to that acute stage.”   The United States spends some $2.5 trillion on health care each year. That works out to about 15 percent of gross domestic product, considerably higher than any other developed economy, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. A growing number of clinics like the Family Van operate in the United States, according to the Mobile Health Clinics Network, which has been tracking clinic numbers for six years and finds more each time it conducts its informal census. “There is no doubt about it, it’s growing,” said Darien DeLorenzo, executive director of the San Francisco-based group. The mobile clinics are largely nonprofit and most provide general medical care, though smaller numbers specialize in dentistry or mammography. Many urban clinics keep budgets tight by relying on healthcare educators and students as staff, referring patients to doctors or hospitals when more is needed. Their rural counterparts more frequently have doctors and nurses on board, to serve communities without health care facilities. The Family Van estimates that every dollar it spends on its operations pays off $36 in economic benefits, including the effect of averting nonemergency visits to hospital emergency rooms and the value of the tests it provides. The average visit to the Family Van costs $117, versus $923 for a nonemergency visit to a hospital emergency room, according to an analysis by the clinic, Harvard Medical School and other experts. These programs can also help push the nation’s overall medical tab down by alerting people to nascent health problems before they become critical, advocates said. “When you’re serving the underserved, healthcare is a luxury,” said Kathy Ficco, executive director of community health at the St. Joseph Mobile Health Clinic in Rohnert Park, California, which operates a similar clinic. “Their main focus is food and shelter ... It’s not until a problem creates pain or suffering that they will seek care.”   A visit to the Family Van can take as little as seven minutes, though staffers will spend as much as 45 minutes with people who have questions about their conditions. “Going to the hospital takes a long time,” said Badshah Rahman, 38, who stopped in on an August afternoon for a regular blood pressure check. “This is really easy.”   Many of the Family Van’s patients are regular visitors who drop in every few weeks. That level of frequency may be the clinics’ greatest benefit. “What you need there is ongoing monitoring of folks with chronic conditions and to the extent they don’t have that kind of ongoing monitoring in the traditional health care system, the van fills in that gap ... that’s terrific,” said Michael Sparer, chair of the department of health policy and management at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Still, he noted, clinics staffed by educators cannot provide the same level of care as a visit to a doctor. “They are a stopgap solution,” Sparer said. Even in Massachusetts, where a law passed in 2006 requires almost every resident to have health insurance, many inner-city residents turn to hospital emergency rooms first. This is a problem that may play out across the United States in the wake of the healthcare reform law, which aims to extend health insurance to 32 million uninsured Americans. “Everybody has a doctor on paper but they can’t get in,” the Family Van’s Bennet said. “The number of doctors hasn’t changed, just the number of people who have insurance.”",0
"""Volkswagen is readying two Chinese factories to build electric cars next year. The Chinese plants will have a production capacity of 600,000 vehicles, according to Volkswagen’s plans, which have not been previously reported - revealing VW’s ability to industrialise production faster than other pioneers in the electric vehicle market. Tesla is still trying to reach its goal of making more than 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai, China, while VW can rely on an established workforce in two of its plants in Anting and Foshun to build zero-emission cars. The scale and speed of VW’s electrification push marks a shift in favour of established manufacturers that can use existing factories and profit from combustion-engined sport  utility vehicles (SUVs) to scale up faster than startups. “The truth is barriers to entry in autos remain high,” said Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “Making cars is hard. The move to electric vehicles will be expensive, but will probably be led by traditional manufacturers.”   VW is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories and workers, long a handicap to its profitability, more aggressively than rivals BMW, Renault SA, General Motors Co and Tesla, which were all quicker to sell a custom-designed electric car. Rather than adjusting production gradually, and using multi-powertrain platforms, Volkswagen is making a massive bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture, known as MEB, in the hope of increasing economies of scale sufficiently to push down the price of electric cars to around 20,000 euros ($22,262). The Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker is retooling eight plants across the globe by 2022 to specialise in manufacturing electric cars, and license its electric MEB platform to rivals, senior VW executives told Reuters, putting it on track to become the world’s largest maker of zero-emission vehicles. Tesla has emerged as a serious competitor with a credible car, its Model 3, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters last week. But startups have a hard time entering mass production without sufficient production facilities, he said. “The question is, can you expand your production quickly enough? The capital intensity is increasing,” Diess said. To fund its own electrification shift, the German carmaker aims to increase sales of VW SUVs, with combustion engines, to 40% of overall sales by 2020 from 23% in 2018. The powerstation that supplies energy for VW’s flagship e-vehicle factory in Zwickau, Germany, marked by two tall chimneys, was built to power production of the combustion-engined Volkswagen Golf. Now Zwickau can piggyback off this infrastructure to ramp up production to 330,000 VW ID electric cars by 2021. Volkswagen Group will increase economies of scale by rolling out electric vehicle platforms to its Audi, Skoda and Seat and Porsche brands. Volkswagen Group will be in a position to build 22 million electric cars by 2028, of which 11.6 million could come out of Chinese factories, VW said. For a graphic version of story """"Global automakers invest in electric vehicles"""", click: tmsnrt.rs/2Hcr3H4  VW’s expansion push comes at a time when investors have started to question businesses delivering growth without real profit, a change in sentiment that is crippling the ability of several electric car pioneers to raise more cash. Back in 2016, Tesla said it wanted to build more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018, a goal it has failed to meet. This year it expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models. Tesla’s struggles have dampened optimism about how easy it is to enter the car business, making it harder for China’s NIO, backed by internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd, as well as others like Faraday Future and Byton Ltd, to fund the next stage of growth: capital-intensive volume production and sales. “So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted earlier this month. “It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you.”   After starting trial production runs at its factory in Shanghai, Tesla now hopes to reach its 500,000-vehicle  target in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020. Tesla is also looking for a site to start production in Europe. Volkswagen is converting two German plants, Hanover and Zwickau, to build electric vehicles and will retool other factories including plants in China: Foshan which VW runs together with its joint-venture partner FAW-Volkswagen, and another in Anting, which VW runs together with SAIC. It will retool plants in Emden and Dresden in Germany, Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, in United States, as part of a 30 billion-euro ($33.24 billion)investment push into e-mobility by 2023. As a result, Volkswagen Group will be the No. 1 electric vehicle producer globally by 2025, while Tesla is likely to remain a niche player, according to UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel. The cutthroat rivalry between automakers and software companies started when Alphabet Inc’s Google presented a prototype autonomous vehicle in 2012, leading analysts and industry executives to fear a so-called Nokia moment. This occurs when a new player from the tech sector unveils a superior design, in the way that Apple Inc presented the iPhone in 2007, ending Nokia’s dominance of the mobile handset business. Today, Tesla’s cars are generally perceived as cutting-edge and potentially more sophisticated than VW’s. Volkswagen’s ID.3,  which starts production this year, has an operating range of between 330 and 550 kilometers (205 to 341 miles), below the 560 km long-range Model 3 version offered by Tesla. That is because Tesla has a sophisticated software algorithm to control how much electricity goes to the electric motor, air conditioning, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, and cooling system. Volkswagen’s edge is more blunt: price and massive economies of scale. The ID.3 has a starting price of under 30,000 euros  ($33,363) in Germany. By contrast, Tesla’s Model 3 had an average selling price of $50,000 in the second quarter. The long-range version retails for 52,390 euros in Germany. The VW vehicle’s lower price comes from the carmaker’s ability to place large orders which, by nature of their size, help drive down the price. Volkswagen is investing 50 billion euros ($55.5 billion) to buy battery cells and will also license its MEB electric car platform to rival carmakers to further increase economies of scale. That is, Volkswagen will make that huge investment if suppliers can keep up. “There is a lot of investment,” Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen Group’s board member responsible for procurement, told Reuters last month. “But even the big companies like Samsung, CATL, LG Chem, the big guys, SK, they hesitate to take so much money and invest because they are not seeing the market on the other side.”   “We are now seeing the first battery plants, LG in Poland, CATL in Germany, they don’t have the skilled workforce. That will be the bottleneck,” Sommer said. “It’s a learning curve everybody has to work through. This will cause some lags in supply. We have no other choice.”  VW plans to license its electric MEB vehicle platform to rival Ford Motor Co, which will give VW $10 billion in revenue over the next six years. Thomas Ulbrich, Volkswagen’s member of the board who oversees production of electric vehicles, told Reuters, “Ford and Volkswagen’s agreement will be a blueprint for further licensing deals.”   In the short term, Volkswagen and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest 15 billion euros to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025. “The first MEB-based vehicle is an SUV model,” Volkswagen said about its China push.

"Less than a year after Chinese scientists caused an international furor by saying they had genetically modified human embryos, Kathy Niakan, a stem cell scientist from London’s Francis Crick Institute, was granted a license to carry out similar experiments. “The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has approved a research application from the Francis Crick Institute to use new ‘gene editing’ techniques on human embryos,” Niakan’s lab said on Monday. It said the work carried out “will be for research purposes and will look at the first seven days of a fertilized egg’s development, from a single cell to around 250 cells”. The scientists will not be allowed to develop the modified embryos for clinical purposes or implant them into any women. Niakan plans to carry out her experiments using what is known as CRISPR-Cas9, a technology that is already the subject of fierce international debate because of fears that it could be used to create babies to order. CRISPR can enable scientists to find and modify or replace genetic defects. Many experts have called it “game-changing”. David King, director of the UK campaign group Human Genetics Alert, said Niakan’s plans would eventually lead to “a future of consumer eugenics”. “This research will allow the scientists to refine the techniques for creating GM babies,” he said in a statement. But Sarah Norcross, director of Progress Educational Trust, which campaigns for ethically sound research in genetics, said the HFEA’s decision was “a victory for level-headed regulation over moral panic”. Niakan says she has no intention of genetically altering embryos for use in human reproduction, but wants to deepen scientific understanding of how a healthy human embryo develops, something that could, in the long term, help to improve infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). The work will be carried out on embryos that have become surplus to donor patients IVF treatment. At a briefing for reporters in London last month, she said the first gene she planned to target was one called Oct4, which she believes may have a crucial role in the earliest stages of human fetal development. Bruce Whitelaw, a professor of animal biotechnology at Edinburgh University’s Roslin Institute on Scotland, said the HFEA’s decision had been reached “after robust assessment”. “This project, by increasing our understanding of how the early human embryo develops and grows, will add to the basic scientific knowledge needed for devising strategies to assist infertile couples and reduce the anguish of miscarriage,” he said in an emailed comment.",0
"When Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) took their oaths of office on 3 January 2019, they became the first Muslim women to be sworn in as members of Congress. A week-and-a-half later, on 12 January, an article appeared on a website called “So Right It Hurts” alleging that Tlaib and Omar had already co-sponsored legislation adding two Islamic observances, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, to the roster of federally recognized holidays and were laying plans to add even more: Freshman Congressmen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have wasted no time in shaking up the US House of Representatives. Early Friday morning, Omar and Tlaib introduced a bill adding Islamic holidays to the Federal calendar which has traditionally only recognized American holidays. Omar and Tlaib’s bill would add Eid Al-Fitr at the end of Ramadan and the four-day-long celebration of Eid Al-Adha to the list of Federally recognized holidays, potentially granting reasons to banks, schools, and other businesses to remain closed for five additional days per year. Omar and Tlaib justified their work as making America more inclusive of it’s Muslim-American population and moving us further away from our history as a primarily Christian nation. The women are also considering a last minute addition to their bill that would allow for regular Salah time breaks for school children and workers as well as a designated area in each public business where Muslims could perform Salah, the five daily prayers plus the Friday prayer, unmolested. However, as of mid-January 2019, neither Tlaib nor Omar was shown on the website of the U.S. Congress as having sponsored (or co-sponsored) any legislation at all, much less legislation pertaining to Islamic affairs. It seems unlikely, moreover, that the first legislative endeavor of any fledgling representative would be trying to create new federal holidays. The last time Congress passed a bill designating a new federal holiday was in 1983 when Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday received formal recognition. No president since Ronald Reagan has signed such a bill. In point of fact, the story was fabricated from start to finish. A disclaimer on the So Right It Hurts website describes its content as “paradoxical,” and “for parody purposes only”: “All information on the Site and our mobile app are paradoxical, that is a ‘literary work in which the style of an author or work is closely imitated for comic effect or in ridicule.’ These articles range from misleading to wildly imaginative and are provided in good faith the reader understands that, however, we make no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, adequacy, validity, reliability, availability or completeness of any information on the Site or our mobile application.” A notice on the site’s “About Us” page phrases it even more succinctly:",1
"A Numero Uno pizza is served at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago January 20, 2010. REUTERS/John Gress The scuttled changes, which would have stripped pizza’s status as a vegetable and limited how often French fries could be served, stemmed from a 2010 child nutrition law calling on schools to improve the nutritional quality of lunches served to almost 32 million U.S. school children. The action is a win for the makers of frozen French fries and pizza and comes just weeks after the deep-pocketed food, beverage and restaurant industries successfully weakened government proposals for voluntary food marketing guidelines to children. “It’s an important victory,” said Corey Henry, spokesman for the American Frozen Food Institute (AFFI). That trade association lobbied Congress on behalf of frozen pizza sellers like ConAgra Foods Inc and Schwan Food Co and French   fry makers McCain Foods Ltd and J.R. Simplot Co, the latter best known as a supplier to fast-food company McDonald’s Corp.   “Our concern is that the standards would force companies in many respects to change their products in a way that would make them unpalatable to students,” Henry said. Other AFFI members include H.J. Heinz Co, General Mills Inc and Kraft Foods Inc. The school lunch provisions were a small part of a mammoth bill that provides money for all parts of the federal government. The House sent the bill to the Senate for final Congressional approval. “They started out with French fries and now they have moved on to pizza,” said Jared Polis, Colorado Democrat, who lamented the government’s subsidy of unhealthy diets through school meals. “Pizza alone (without side dishes) ... common sense, it’s not a vegetable.”   Calls to Minnesota-based Schwan and its external public relations firm and ConAgra were not returned. Mark Dunn, AFFI’s chairman and J.R. Simplot’s main lobbyist, referred requests for comment to a company spokesman, who declined to respond. Polis mentioned French fries in reference to a provision in the bill that would have blocked the government from limiting servings of white potatoes to one cup per week in meals served through the roughly $18 billion U.S. school meals program overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In addition to potatoes, USDA also proposed limits on starchy vegetables including corn, green peas and lima beans, while requiring lunches to serve a wider variety of fruit and vegetables. Another provision bars the USDA from changing the way it credits tomato paste, used in pizza. The change would have required pizza to have at least a half-cup of tomato paste to qualify as a vegetable serving. Current rules, which likely will remain in place, require just two tablespoons of tomato paste. According to a USDA report from November 2007, pizza and French fries were among the most commonly consumed lunch foods by participants in the national school lunch program. Sam Farr of California, the Democratic leader on the appropriations subcommittee in charge of the USDA, said the interference with USDA rule-writing was “wrong” and “shouldn’t be done”. Still, Farr supported passage of the overall bill. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on Wednesday that U.S. school children would still see more fruit and vegetables, more grains, more low-fat milk and less salt and fat in meals despite the language in the spending bill. “First of all, we can assure parents of school-age children (that) USDA will do everything it can” to improve the nutritional quality of school meals, as required by the 2010 child nutrition law. Vilsack was speaking via teleconference from Hanoi during a U.S. trade trip. Healthier school lunches are a cornerstone of First Lady Michelle Obama’s campaign to end childhood obesity. Nearly one in three children in America is overweight or obese and the numbers are growing. “Clearly more pizza and French fries in schools is not good for kids, but it’s good for companies that make pizza and French fries,” said Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group that advocates better food and nutrition policies. Wootan said U.S. food makers trumpet products they say are healthy while at the same time lobbying against regulations aimed at improving the nutritional quality of their products. “A year ago, I was walking the halls of Congress arm-in-arm with the food industry, fighting for healthier school lunches,” Wootan said. “Today, we are on opposite sides, and I’m battling to keep them from weakening school nutrition standards and school marketing guidelines and other provisions.”",0
"The story discusses costs in a very interesting way – because the point of the research was modifying human behavior by paying “rewards” of cash to patients and sometimes doctors. What we didn’t find in the story is the “cost” of manpower to run a program like this. How much would it cost (besides the actual cost of $1,204 per patient-doctor pair) to administer this? How practical is it? We applaud the writer for including this paragraph – giving the real context that matters most. Italics added by editor. “Still to come is an analysis of whether the amounts paid in the study – up to $1,024 over the course of a year – would be worth it, in terms of avoiding the costs of treating a certain number of heart attacks and strokes.” Overall, the story does an excellent job of addressing the cost trade-offs. There were four patient groups. The story does a great job of describing the precise benefits, in terms of blood cholesterol, that each patient group showed (if any). The group that benefited the most was the one where both patients and doctors received incentives. That group showed a drop of 33.6 points in LDL cholesterol, compared to a 25.1 drop in the group that received no money. It may have been useful to include a sense of how that reduction might translate into reduced risk of a heart attack (one could use the risk calculator the story mentions to calculate an estimate, or ask one of the sources to help with this). But while quantifying the drops in cholesterol is important, we also wanted to know whether the incentives actually translated to increased compliance with the medication regimen. Other factors beyond the medication usage (diet, genetics, etc.) may have impacted participants’ cholesterol levels, so it would be interesting to know if the cholesterol results were confirmed by the medication adherence findings. The story does a nice job describing some of the subtle downsides associated with the pay-for-taking-meds approach as well as the side effects of the meds themselves. All four groups in the study, even those who did not receive any payment, were issued electronic pill bottles. As one commenter said “they might have felt they were being watched.” The bottles sent a signal of some sort when opened, so that researchers would know who opened the top. Another commenter pointed out that if money as incentive works for a short-term, how do we know patients would continue past the payment stage? These limitations are part of why one outside commenter described the results as “a nice first step.” The story makes clear the methods and comparison in the randomized controlled study, and the quality of evidence. It includes important elements like study size and study design, and it touches on some limitations. There is no disease mongering. The story goes beyond just “satisfactory.” Extra stars for including a patient (who was not involved) who is an advocate in this area, as well as researchers not involved in the study. The piece does a great job on this. The alternatives in this case would be other ways to motivate patients to take statins, and we think the story does this well. The story makes clear that paying cash to patients to take medicine is an experimental idea, not something that your local doctor is likely to offer. But with that said, it might have been helpful to ask one of the sources about how widespread this approach is and in what contexts it is being used (there are examples around the country). The story accurately suggests that’s what’s novel here is paying both patients and physicians to improve compliance. The story could have been clearer about the fact that there are a number of other studies looking at patient financial incentives. The story mentions one example (related to smoking) in the introduction, but it could have gone further. The story does not rely on a news release, but is a fine example of where extra reporting can provide context.",0
"Under current laws, scooters can only be driven on roads, they need to carry license plates, and riders require a motorcycle license. The world-record sprinter and co-founder of Bolt Mobility announced the launch at an event in a Tokyo restaurant on Friday. The initial goal is to limit its scooter rentals to private land, which is exempted from the traffic regulations, and to be operating on 40 university campuses by the end of 2020. Beyond that, representatives of the year-old American start-up are talking with regulators about easing restrictions, arguing its scooters can reduce traffic congestion and thereby reduce emissions. Bolt hopes his celebrity can help deliver that message. “We’re still talking and trying to figure out how to push forward and do better things for the environment, because that’s where it started,” he said in an interview with Reuters following the event. “This is the future.”   Bolt Mobility aims to be in 20 cities globally by the end of this year and 50 across eight countries in 2020. Earlier this year, it launched in New York, Paris and Washington. E-scooter sharing has become a popular option for so-called “last-mile” commutes in many urban centers worldwide, but they have also created problems. In San Francisco, customers have abandoned the vehicles on public walkways, spurring the city attorney to call them a “public nuisance.”   Paris has tightened rules on where scooters can be ridden following two deaths and scores of injuries. An elderly cyclist died after colliding with an e-scooter in Singapore in September. In Tokyo, e-scooters are still a rarity, and under current laws are treated as low-powered motorcycles. However there is growing momentum for making them more mainstream. At the Tokyo Motor Show this month, hosted by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, visitors could try out electric scooters built by Japanese and foreign startups. The world’s largest e-scooter company, Lime, joined the Japanese lobby group Microbility Promotion Council on Thursday. However a change in regulation may take some time, despite the backing of some Japanese government officials. “Even though everyone says it’s very convenient, safety has to be the top priority,” an official at Japan’s transport ministry said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media. “That’s going to be an extremely high hurdle.”",1
"""A reader recently sent us a years-old chain email that has morphed into something more timely. It now has the heading, """"IMPORTANT ACTION INFORMATION FOR NOVEMBER, 2014  VOTE."""" For years before that, though, the chain email has floated around the Internet, making the scary claim that """"at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."""" PolitiFact Oregon gave this a rating of  when they looked at it in 2013. The email -- which has changed somewhat as it has zigzagged around social media -- can be identified by its attribution of the information to Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. (More on him later.) It opens with a dire warning: """"MEDICARE AT AGE 76, IMPORTANT PLEASE READ - ANYONE WHO DOUBTS THIS IS TRUE CAN DOWNLOAD THE NEW OBAMA CARE AND LOOK UP THE PAGES MENTIONED. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING......THIS should be read by everyone, especially important to those over 75..... If you are younger, then it may apply to your parents…."""" However, the email is hardly up-to-date -- it’s been circulating since 2009 and apparently stems from a list of tweets by blogger Peter Fleckenstein about H.R. 3200. That was an early version of the legislation that later became the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Many aspects of that original bill never made it into law, and other provisions have been misinterpreted or exaggerated by the email’s author. In fact, our friends at FactCheck.org found that just four of the email’s 48 claims were accurate. Here, we'll recap what we know about the cancer claim and a few of the email's other points. The cancer claim The email bases its claim about the age-based rationing of cancer care on page 272 of H.R. 3200, section 1145. But the claim is not correct. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010. It does not include rationing for cancer treatment based on age or any other demographic factor. Nor did the precursor bill, H.R. 3200, include a cut-off age for cancer treatments. One provision of H.R. 3200 did include a section on """"treatment of certain cancer hospitals,"""" but this simply allowed Medicare -- the federally run health plan for those older than 65 -- to allocate more funding to cancer hospitals if they incurred higher costs. The American Nurses Association called this the """"opposite of rationing."""" Under current legislation, """"all medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age,"""" said Katherine Fitzpatrick of the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group, in a June 2013 interview. The Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the largest national organization of seniors, agree that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare. Under the version of the Affordable Care Act that was adopted, Medicare payments to hospitals can be reduced if patients are readmitted within 30 days for certain conditions, such as pneumonia, but that’s not what the email claims. Meanwhile, the email raises a legitimate concern -- """"rationing"""" -- but does so in a misleading way. """"Everyone hates the word ‘rationing,’ """" Harvard University health-policy specialist Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact in 2009. But rationing is not something that suddenly appeared in the Affordable Care Act, she added. """"From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything."""" It’s theoretically possible to spend an unlimited amount on health care, but as a society, we only have a limited amount of public resources -- so tough decisions have to be made on how to allocate those resources. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, """"rationing"""" occurred when private insurers denied coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, or denied reimbursement for certain basic services, or priced their plans too high for certain consumers to pay. If anything, John F. Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center, said in an earlier interview that private insurers are historically more likely to deny health services than Medicare is. """"That's the argument you hear people making,"""" he said. """"But I think they have it backwards."""" A final word. Remember Judge Kithil, the supposed author of the email? He’s disowned it. """"I wish it would die. I can’t control it,"""" David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon in 2013. """"I don’t know how something like that goes viral."""" The former judge recalled that he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune, circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, it was republished online. Kithil said he wants readers to disregard his letter, since it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. """"I’ve had calls from all over the country -- 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this,"""" he said at the time. He said he pleads with the callers, """"Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it."""" Our ruling The chain email says that the Affordable Care Act requires that, """"at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."""" With this email, longevity has not meant accuracy: Seniors do not need to worry about their cancer care being yanked away once they reach age 76. The claims are based on an incorrect understanding of a bill that never passed. The Affordable Care Act does not include any sections on seniors losing their treatment eligibility once they reach age 76.""",1
"Affordability of fish varies widely around the world so we can understand not bringing up costs. The intervention advocated is consuming a fish protein called parvalbumin, or PV for short. Some readers may be curious if this protein can be found in the fish oils that are widely marketed. Nonetheless, the issue of cost doesn’t seem entirely applicable here. The release doesn’t include any numbers to help put the benefits claimed in context. Early in the news release a lead author is quoted as saying: Parvalbumin collects up the ‘Parkinson’s protein’ and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first. Lower down in the news release it says: Increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson’s disease The italics are ours to emphasize that unjustified leaps of causality, and unjustified language, are used to imply benefits that can’t be supported by this study. This study simply hypothesizes that PV, by binding with alpha-synuclein, prevents it from forming amyloid chains with other proteins. We’ve written many times about the uncertainty surrounding amyloids (of all types/subtypes) as a sign of, or contributor to, neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s. The news release is dominated by suggestions that parvalbumin could help with Parkinson’s and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, ALS and Huntington’s but only at the very end do we learn it’s been studied as a a cause of fish allergies. Is this the only harm? We don’t know because harms aren’t included. A major problem with this news release is that it does not mention this was an in vitro experiment; that is, conducted in a controlled environment outside a living organism (aka a laboratory experiment). Above all else that should be highlighted clearly and early in the news release. It should also be made clear that no cause and effect relationship between amyloid proteins and the development of any neurologic disease has ever been established. Put another way, anything that inhibits amyloid formation — whether it be a diet, drug, or something else — does not equate with either preventing or treating any diseases of the brain. While there is no overt disease mongering, there are subtle influences here. For example,  the reader is told of a linkage of amyloid and a host of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and then an author notes: “These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There’s going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future – and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.” The clear take away message being conveyed is these disease are of concern and eating fish is the answer. The funding sources for the study and any potential conflicts among the researchers are not mentioned in the release. The published article acknowledges funding from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Olle Engqvist Foundation and the Chalmers Foundation. No alternatives to preventing Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases are mentioned. On the surface this omission may seem justified since there are none. But perhaps it would help readers to tell them this up front. The following is our suggested wording: “Please note there are no interventions of any kind proven to prevent any neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, no cause and effect relationship between amyloid (of any kind) and these diseases have ever been established. Finally, this is an in vitro study, so no conclusions regarding clinical efficacy in humans can be made.” Fish is widely available. We’re told the protein of interest, parvalbumin, is found in higher concentrations in certain species, and that this concentration is seasonal and tends to peak in late summer. This is not the first research attempting to link parvalbumin with a host of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s. And while there is no direct clear claim of novelty, “shining a light…” suggests this is a new discovery. There are glimpses of cautious language in this news release such as: “It will be interesting  to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth.” “The team is careful to note that no definite links (between higher fish consumption) can be established at this point.” But this is drowned out by unjustified phrasing (italicized) like this: “Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases.” “increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson’s disease.” “Other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, ALS, and Huntington’s disease are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain.” Finally, the evidence here is in fish. Not humans. And even if it was in humans the language used in this news release would still be unjustified.",1
"On 28 August 2016, the web site Associated Media Coverage reported that eleven U.S. states had outlawed the use of electronic cigarettes inside cars: Eleven states working in conjunction with the U.S Department of Transportation (D.O.T) have agreed to implement an ordinance banning the use of electronic cigarettes in vehicles – meaning if you are a resident of one of the impacted states, you will be prohibited from utilizing an electronic cigarette while inside your vehicle. The U.S Department of Transportation, who admittedly placed pressure on state officials to implement the ordinance within their respective states are hopeful that representatives across the country will take notice and agree to implement and enforce a similar ban by early 2017. According to Colton Husker, a U.S Department Transportation representative, the ordinance was born out of a necessity to keep drivers safe. According to statistics published on the D.O.T website, approximately 5,834 automobile fatalities related to distracted drivers occurred across the country throughout 2015. This is an almost 30% increase to the 4,523 fatalities reported in 2014. The statistics found on the D.O.T website indicate that approximately 57% of all automobile fatalities in both 2014 and 2015 were reportedly caused by distracted drivers. According to Husker, drivers are becoming increasingly more distracted by the use of electronic cigarettes as the devices are becoming more popular. Representatives from the 11- states that have agreed to implement the ordinance (California, North Carolina, Illinois, Texas, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and New York) have said that their states will begin implementing the ordinance as soon as Early-November 2016 and expect all residents and motorists to be in compliance immediately upon implementation. All participating states have agreed to implement the ordinance by January 3rd, 2017. Included with the article was a list of purported penalties for non-compliance with the new laws, including fines and suspension of driving privileges: First Offense: $100 fine Second Offense: $250 fine Third Offense: $500 fine Fourth Offense: $825 fine, 60-day Suspension of Driver’s License Notably, no other news outlet reported on the multi-state law purportedly affecting drivers across the country despite the widespread popularity of e-cigarettes. That’s because the report was false: Associated Media Coverage is a fake news site that typically spreads fabrications pertaining to non-existent laws and statutes which would affect a specific subset of the population. Prior falsehoods from the site include tales of a looming motorcycle curfew in March 2016, a motorcycle speed ban in August 2016, an impending FDA e-juice ban not long after that, and a claim several jurisdictions were codifying a “two pet maximum” ordinance (meaning many households would be forced to rehome beloved pets).",1
"Cost is not a relevant criterion in this case as the comparison is made between breast milk and formula. Both feeding methods entail costs, both financial and other, that we feel are beyond the scope of the coverage. There are a couple of improvements we recommend here. First, we wish that the drop in odds of ROP had been reported more precisely, as there are many different combinations of variables being compared in the study. To start, the disease ROP is separated into 1) any-stage and 2) severe. (These terms are used here and there in the article but not defined.) For each level of ROP, the study makes the following comparisons: Out of the four comparisons, the drop in odds of ROP (any-stage or severe) of breast milk versus formula is the most eye-catching in the fourth comparison. This also happens to be the comparison reported in the second paragraph of the article. While we do not wish to presume this comparison was cherry-picked, we feel that if word count had been a factor in limiting the reporting of only one comparison above, the second comparison is the one that should have been reported. This is because the sample size is largest for the second comparison, giving more credence (or as statisticians might say, more power) to the numbers. More precision is also warranted regarding the specific comparison being made. The statistics cited in the second paragraph fail to mention that the comparison is between exclusive human milk and exclusive formula. Later in the article, two more statistics, a 75% drop and 46% drop in the odds of ROP, are cited. Here, it would’ve been good to qualify the statistic by stating that these numbers relate to drops in any-stage ROP. Moreover, these are relative risk comparisons, and so it’s unclear if these impressive-sounding drops in risk translate to large absolute numbers. The story could have clarified that. In the framework of our criteria, the intervention in this study is the feeding of human milk. The potential harms of human milk do not seem to warrant a discussion in this article however. Sometimes statisticians sound like broken records with their “correlation is not causation” warnings. The article is one step ahead in this case. We find the following sentences that would make every statistician proud: However, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study’s design. Also, the article shows a good grasp of the evidence quality by reporting some of the limitations of the study, including the limitation that the study looked only at a mother’s own breast milk, not donor milk. The story safely clears our bar here, but it could have done even better to avoid phrases such as this one: “Breast-feeding a premature infant may help reduce the risk of a serious eye problem known as retinopathy of prematurity.” The active verb “help reduce” suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that, as the story tells us, is not appropriate to imply with a study such as this one. We paused to take a second look at the statement that ROP “has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time.” That sounds scary, but the story qualifies things nicely when it notes, “The greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries.” That’s good context because it explains that the condition is actually a consequence of a positive trend in health care. Thumbs up here for interviewing an independent source, Dr. Adolfo Llanos. Although, we question the choice to end the article with the following quote from Dr. Llanos The takeaway from this study, Llanos said, is to breast-feed as long as possible, if possible. That’s slightly puzzling, since the stated conclusion in the original study is much more tentative Based on current limited evidence, in very preterm newborns, human milk feeding potentially plays a protective role in preventing any-stage ROP and severe ROP. The story would have probably done better to omit this source’s simplistic conclusion. The article does not mention other preventative measures to take against ROP besides breast milk and formula. But neither does the original study, so we’ll leave this criterion as not applicable. We won’t dock points from the story for not discussing the availability of formula and breast milk. Although those topics could certainly sustain such a discussion had the story chosen to address them. The article clearly identifies the underlying study being based on a reanalysis of five previously published studies on ROP (or what is known in the lingo as a meta-analysis). The article might have indicated that this is one of the first such meta-analyses done on ROP. We can be fairly confident that the article did not rely solely on a news release, especially since it has an independent source.",0
"Much of the focus of the piece was on costs. The story did an adequate job quantifying the operative mortality, blood transfusion and length-of-stay rates among the three groups studied. (Unfortunately, it did so inconsistently – sometimes giving data for all 3 types of surgery, sometimes providing results for only 2 surgical approaches.) We’ll give it a satisfactory score here. But are these the outcomes that really matter? That’s something we address in the “Evidence” criterion below. As with the benefits criterion above, the details provided were adequate. The story nodded in the direction of the accompanying editorial, but we wish it had captured the important points as written by the editorialist: While this study provides some important information that will help patients, providers and policy makers make these value judgments, it fails to capture 3 important elements. First, as the authors note, the costs estimates do not include the capital investment of purchasing a robotic system or the indirect economic benefits of patients’ early return to work and increased productivity. Second, the analysis fails to capture the human cost of the learning curve. In other words, as providers learn new surgical techniques, outcomes are often worse for patients early in the learning curve as hypothesized by Hu and others. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the study fails to capture patient reported outcomes such as postoperative pain, return to baseline functional status and health related quality of life, all of which are highly germane to the procedures under study here. It is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the costeffectiveness of minimally invasive technologies without including these critical outcomes. Future comparative effectiveness studies of these techniques must include patient reported outcomes as the primary end point if they are to inform the debate regarding the value of our interventions. No disease mongering at play here. The story included some input from the editorial writer – although, as stated above in the “Evidence” criterion – perhaps not to its greatest effectiveness. The focus of the story was on a study comparing robot-assisted surgery with two other surgical techniques. The availability of all 3 surgical approaches studies – while not explicitly described – could be inferred from the study details reported. The story didn’t provide any context on the growing body of literature about comparative effectiveness questions in this field as robotic surgery proliferates. It does not appear that the story relied on a news release.",0
"""The Republican storyline on the crisis in Crimea ties Russian aggression to foreign policy mistakes by President Barack Obama. Former Vice President Dick Cheney pressed this interpretation of events in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation. """"We have created an image around the world, not just for the Russians, of weakness, of indecisiveness,"""" Cheney said. """"The Syrian situation is a classic. We got all ready to do something. A lot of the allies signed on. At the last minute, Obama backed off."""" Cheney obviously thought Syria was a telling example, because he came back and said it again a few moments later. International support for military intervention in Syria was a muddy business, and we thought we should look at where America’s allies stood after chemical weapons were used in Syria. Were """"a lot of them ready to go""""? We reached out to Cheney, via the Republican National Committee, to learn which allies he had in mind. The RNC made an effort but we did not hear back before we published. A quick recap In August 2012, President Obama told reporters that the United States had no plans to use military force against Syria but """"a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus."""" A year later, an attack on an opposition-held suburbs on the outskirts of Damascus brought matters to a head. The bodies brought into hospitals and the illness that struck the doctors and nurses that treated the victims pointed to the use of chemical weapons. The attack took place on Aug. 21 and within a week, the administration was talking about launching air strikes at weapon depots and military command centers in Syria. Under the best of circumstances for the White House, any such military action would come with some sort of endorsement from the United Nations Security Council and the participation of America’s key European and Middle Eastern allies. Who signed on and who didn’t Both France and Britain were early supporters of a limited air strike. French President Francois Hollande said, """"France is ready to punish those who took the heinous decision to gas innocents."""" British Prime Minister David Cameron said the international response should be legal and proportionate, while a top official was quoted as saying it was """"reasonable to assume our armed forces are making contingency plans."""" But while Cameron was counted among those ready to attack, the British parliament took a different view. At the end of August, dozens of members of Cameron’s own party deserted him, and a motion to back the use of force failed by 13 votes. It was an unprecedented loss for a prime minister, and Cameron said he would cancel a military deployment that had already begun. Support among the other European states was equally hard to find. Italy said it would only go along if the U.N. Security Council approved the use of force. Germany was seen as a pivotal player and was clearly against military action. With opinion polls showing over 60 percent of Germans favoring diplomacy over force, and elections just a few weeks away, the German government stopped well short of endorsing a military response. Germany signed on to a G20 statement that called the use of poisonous gas a war crime and said the Syrian government was the likely culprit. But having said that, the statement added, """"The EU underscores at the same time the need to move forward with addressing the Syrian crisis through the U.N. process."""" The role of the United Nations was critical because the strongest legal justification for an air strike would come through the U.N. Security Council. That was impossible since two permanent members, Russia and China, had made it clear they would veto any such resolution. The strongest support within NATO came from Turkey. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was the most eager to see an attack on Syria, a long-time political foe. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were also on board. However, the Arab League never approved a military strike. As the White House aimed to muster international backing, it looked for ways to maintain a sense of momentum. On Sept. 6, it released a joint statement from Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The statement called for """"a strong international response to this grave violation of the world’s rules and conscience that will send a clear message that this kind of atrocity can never be repeated. Those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable."""" However, the nature of """"a strong international response"""" was left undefined. At one point, the administration said 25 nations had signed on but that did not mean they all endorsed air strikes. Ultimately, even France said it wanted to wait for a final report from U.N. chemical weapons inspectors. By mid September, the United States and Russia had struck a deal that sidelined the use of force in exchange for Syria giving up its chemical weapons. That process is underway but is behind schedule. Our ruling Cheney said a lot of allies """"got ready to go"""" on Syria and """"signed on,"""" but Obama backed out. Actually, very few American allies were """"ready to go."""" We counted France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as countries that were supportive. And France’s support seemed to wane as time went on. Among the """"no"""" crowd were key allies like the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. In fact, the United Kingdom’s parliament offered an embarrassing rebuke to Cameron when it blocked British participation. The Arab League did not endorse the military action, nor did the United Nations. Obama has said he declined to pursue military action because Syria agreed to weapons inspections. There’s no dispute that for whatever reason, military action was not pursued in Syria. But Cheney was re-writing history when he said """"a lot of the allies signed on.""""""",1
"On 26 September 2018, the Institute for Digital Archaeology unveiled a replica of Palmyra, Syria’s iconic Triumphal Arch on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The following day, Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault allegations stemming from their time in high school. Although these two events had little connection to one another (other than taking place in the same city), web sites such as EndOfTheAmericanDream.com published articles which questioned the coincidental timing of the arch’s appearance in Washington:   Is it just a coincidence that the “Arch of Baal” has been erected in Washington D.C. on the exact same week that Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford are testifying before Congress? The future of the U.S. Supreme Court is literally hanging in the balance, and many believe that it is quite odd that this ancient pagan symbol has been put up at this precise moment in time. According to the official website of the Institute for Digital Archaeology, the Arch of Palmyra was unveiled on the National Mall on September 26th, and it will remain there until September 29th. You can view a photograph of the arch standing directly in front of the U.S. Capitol building right here. Just one day after this arch was put up, Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before Congress. Perhaps this is all just a “giant coincidence”, but things of this importance usually don’t happen by accident. The elite deeply understand that symbols have power, and the fact that the Arch of Baal has been placed directly across from the U.S. Capitol is highly significant. The article went on to connect the Triumphal Arch, or Monumental Arch, which was built around 200 A.D. and served as an entrance way to the Temple of Bel, to ritualistic Baal worship and the sacrificing of children. It’s appearance just before Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee was more than coincidental, the article argued, as Kavanaugh could be instrumental in making abortion illegal: In the end, the debate over whether or not to confirm Brett Kavanaugh comes down to the issue of abortion, and this vote in the Senate is going to have tremendous implications for the future of our country … We have murdered far more children than they ever did in the ancient Middle East, and our fate will be the same as theirs if we don’t turn things around as a society. And now an ancient symbol of child sacrifice has been erected directly across from the U.S. Capitol at the precise moment when the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is hanging in the balance. Is this just a coincidence? While the author of this article may see the Triumphal Arch as some sort of symbol related to abortion laws and a seat on the Supreme Court, American politics aren’t the focus of the Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA). The IDA uses state-of-the-art technology to replicate ancient structures as part of their mission to preserve our collective cultural heritage. When the Monumental Arch in Syria was destroyed by Islamic State extremists in August 2015, the IDA set off to recreate a portion of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. IDA founder Roger Michel said that his intention for recreating this famous arch was to show the Islamic State that anything they blew up could be rebuilt: Oxford’s Institute for Digital Archaeology is the creation of American lawyer/archaeologist Roger Michel, with help from Harvard and Dubai. Michel is currently using similar technology to Rutelli’s — better, he claims — to build a 3D facsimile arch from Palmyra’s destroyed Temple of Bel. It is to be unveiled in London’s Trafalgar Square on 19 April and will then travel on to New York. “My intention,” declares Michel, “is to show Islamic State that anything they can blow up we can rebuild exactly as it was before, and rebuild it again and again. We will use technology to disempower Isis.” A replica of the famous arch has already been displayed in New York, London, Florence, and Dubai. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel were both on hand to unveil the monument in Washington, D.C., in September 2018: The Institute for Digital Archaeology, together with its principal partner, the Dubai Future Foundation, documents, preserves and reconstructs heritage objects at sites throughout the Middle East and Europe around the world. It works closely with the United Nations, UNESCO, the British Council and major universities. IDA Director, Roger Michel said of today’s unveiling: It is fitting that the arch has made its way to the place that symbolizes Roman-style representative democracy, an historical legacy that is reflected as much in the classical buildings of Washington as in the design of Palmyra’s monumental classical arch.” Mr Engel summed up the proceedings by declaring that “today we stand shoulder to shoulder, our voices as one, we will not let the terrorists erase history, we are in solidarity with the people of Syria, who have been subjected to such unimaginable horror by ISIS and the Assad Regime. We need to stay committed to ending this barbarity. Projects like this recreation of the Arch of Palmyra are a critical way to celebrate these iconic pieces and keep them very much alive and present in our collective consciousness.” The arch will remain on the Mall at 6th St (opposite the National Gallery of Art) through September 29th.",0
"""All those warnings you heard about secondhand smoke from your mother, federal government PSAs and school D.A.R.E. instructors? Bogus, a Fox Business host claimed recently. In a discussion about waning personal freedom in the free world, pundit John Stossel went off about the onslaught of government rules and regulations telling Americans what they can do and when, where and how they can do it. He used cigarette-smoking as an example, arguing that business owners should have the right to allow smoking in their bars or restaurants even where ordinances or laws ban the practice. """"Yeah, they kill smokers,"""" Stossel said on Fox & Friends of cigarettes. """"But there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people."""" A Fox spokeswoman did not return our inquiry, and Stossel, who has long questioned the lethal nature of secondhand smoke, did not reply to emails and tweets. (The exchange in question was a follow-up to a Dec. 4 segment on his Thursday show, when he said, """"the secondhand smoke scare turns out to be bunk. But the smokers still take it."""") Stossel’s definition of """"good"""" might be different than ours, but there is plenty of scientific research and consensus that secondhand smoke does indeed kill people. Secondhand smoke is a mixture of smoke emitted from the burning end of a cigarette or other tobacco products and what’s exhaled by smokers. It’s regarded as a cancer-causing agent, a """"known human carcinogen"""" (a healthful classification, that is not). The government has campaigned for tough anti-smoking policies in public places and workplaces as a way to protect Americans from secondhand smoke, saying there is no safe level of exposure. Reports from the country’s top doctors say these laws are reducing risk. The U.S. surgeon general has released 31 reports about the effects of smoking since 1964. These reports are extremely detailed, summarizing the latest research on smoking and peer-reviewed by dozens of the nation’s top scientists. Consensus on secondhand smoke really began to form in the 1980s, even as the tobacco industry’s""""doubt-creation machine"""" spun opposing talking points, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, senior scientific editor of the 2014 surgeon general report and director of the University of Southern California’s Institute for Global Health. The surgeon general’s 2006 report stated rather bluntly that inhaling secondhand smoke """"causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in nonsmoking adults."""" Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke killed more than 49,000 nonsmokers in 2005, plus 430 newborns who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the report said. In 2014, the acting surgeon general released a new report, one that factored in input from more than 80 contributing authors and 150 reviewers who are experts in medicine and public health. Secondhand smoke can also increase risk of stroke, the new report found. Beyond that, involuntary exposure poses significant problems for children, worsening asthma and leading to other respiratory conditions. Since 1964, the report said, 2.46 million non-smokers have died from exposure to secondhand smoke. How does the government calculate its numbers? Scientists don’t keep a count of deaths by secondhand smoke as recorded in death certificates. (Death certificates don’t list """"secondhand smoke"""" as a cause of death.) Instead, they rely on statistical methods used by epidemiologists, who are experts in disease patterns within populations. To figure out lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke, for instance, the individual risk of lung cancer is analyzed next to the proportion of people exposed to secondhand smoke. It’s a complicated statistical analysis (page 659 explains more), one with which Stossel obviously finds fault. But it’s not unusual. The same method is used to attribute the number of deaths from obesity through diabetes, for example, Samet said. """"This is the basic way to use to understand how the disease is exposed to this risk,"""" Samet said. """"We understand that there are uncertainties that go with this, but this is a very basic tool. ... The approach here is embedded in science and policy and understanding how much a disease is caused by something."""" The surgeon general is not alone in major scientific organizations linking secondhand smoke with deadly diseases. There’s also the World Health Organization’s International Center for Research on Cancer, the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Cancer Society, and the National Academy of Sciences. """"At this point, the evidence is firm and very powerful, and important conclusions have been reached,"""" Samet said. You can quibble over specific numbers since they’re approximations, said Gary Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. But not that secondhand smoke kills, he said. """"Chronic exposure produces disease and death,"""" Giovino said. How do folks such as Stossel respond? The libertarian Cato Institute published a response to the 2006 surgeon general’s report on secondhand smoke that highlighted testimony before a committee of the British Parliament by Oxford epidemiologist Richard Peto. Peto, who has studied the causes of cancer and the effects of smoking, testified that he could not quantify deaths from secondhand smoke because """"these hazards cannot be directly measured."""" (The story was written by Gio Gori, an epidemiologist who wrote publications on behalf of the industry-backed Tobacco Institute refuting studies about nicotine’s harmful effects.) Conversely, some scientists say the government is actually undercounting secondhand smoke-related deaths. """"The criticism … is not that they overestimate the risk, it’s that they’re underestimating it,""""  said Stanton Glantz, a University of California San Francisco medicine professor and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. And dog lovers, beware: New evidence shows secondhand smoke can also kill pets, including lung and nasal cancer in dogs and malignant lymphoma in cats. Our ruling Stossel said """"there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people."""" His definition of good obviously differs with the vast majority of scientists and researchers studying the effects of secondhand smoke. They say the data does show that secondhand smoke kills people. And that the data is indeed solid. Stossel’s claim rates .""",1
"The Massachusetts study, reported online by the New England Journal of Medicine, was halted after six months because the men using a hormone gel were developing so many heart, breathing and skin problems compared to patients applying a placebo gel to their shoulders or upper arms every day. “I think the study raises important questions about the safety of giving testosterone to older individuals,” Dr. Shalender Bhasin of the Boston University School of Medicine said in a telephone interview. Levels of testosterone, the so-called male hormone, decline with age in men. Supplementing it in healthy men can build muscle mass and strength and lower the risk of disability. The new test was the first to assess its effectiveness in men over 65 who already had mobility problems such as difficulty walking two blocks or climbing 10 stairs. The 209 volunteers, with an average age of 74, also tended to suffer from obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol at the start of the test. “One would expect that from a frail, older population,” said Bhasin. Recipients of the testosterone gel, sold under the brand name Testim by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, became better at walking up stairs and performing chest- and leg-press exercises. But by the time the study was terminated, 23 patients in the testosterone group and five in the placebo group had experienced a bad side effect such as fainting, chest pain or heart attack. One man in the testosterone group died of a suspected heart attack. The numbers were too small to be statistically significant and the side effects encompassed a lot of different diagnoses, which may mean that chance played a role in the results. Yet men receiving testosterone had more serious side effects and more side effects considered to be life-threatening, the researchers said, lasting for three months after the trial ended. “The study was designed to study mobility limitation, a common syndrome with the elderly that predicts disability, poor quality of life and mortality,” Auxilium said in a statement. “We believe these men are not representative of the typical testosterone replacement therapy population.”   Bhasin was surprised by the finding. “Testosterone is not currently approved for older men with age-related decline or mobility problems,” he said. However it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for other patients. Doctors thinking of prescribing testosterone for their older patients should realize that the treatment may pose a serious risk, Bhasin said. “There may be safety issues that they should weigh in their decision,” he said. Testosterone causes salt and water retention and that could have been a factor, the researchers said. The National Institute on Aging, which paid for the trial, also noted that the men in the study may have been getting exceptionally high doses of testosterone. Auxilium said they were getting double to triple the recommended dose.",0
"More than 20 million tonnes of disposable diapers are burned or dumped in landfills globally every year - a major environmental problem since their use became widespread in the 1960s and 1970s. Part of the problem is that collecting, cleaning and breaking diapers into their component parts - plastic, cellulose and super absorbent polymer - is tricky and expensive. The other issue is that no-one has been able to establish a market for the recycled output, dooming previous commercial efforts to failure. Fater, a Pescara, Italy-based business that became a joint venture in 1992, believes it will be able to address these issues, backed by governments, consumers and other companies goaded into action by a new global awareness of the looming crisis of plastics pollution. The new Italian government, in particular, has made finding “circular economy” solutions a pillar of its populist agenda. “Nappies are made of the highest quality plastics and we’ve shown they can be recycled to extract high-value building blocks,” says Marcello Somma, Fater’s director of research and development and business development. For P&G, the world’s leading diaper maker and one of the biggest contributors to the problem with nearly 27 percent of the $44 billion diaper market, Fater ticks several boxes. P&G aims to be able to recycle absorbent hygiene products (AHP), as diapers, incontinence pads and feminine hygiene products are known, in 10 cities by 2030, according to its latest sustainability agenda. In the long term, it hopes to use 100 percent renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging. Roberto Marinucci, P&G’s vice president of global baby wipes, sustainability and the joint venture, said the company had still not established whether consumers would be willing to pay a premium for diapers they know are going to be recycled, but it was clear they want brands to care about the environment. “We believe that the first reason, which is doing the right thing for the consumer, is sufficient enough to convince us to go ahead with the project,” Marinucci said in an interview. Under EU regulations, Fater cannot sell the output of its diaper recycling operation, located near Venice, until it proves there is a market for it. To that end, it has been working on prospective clients and now has 11 letters of intent with businesses like bioplastic manufacturers and paper mills. P&G is also part of an EU-backed group of 13 companies developing end products for the output. They include bioplastic manufacturer, Novamont, which can use the cellulose to make pharmaceutical ingredients. Fater says the plastic from recycled diapers can be used to make school desks and urban playgrounds, cellulose can become viscose fabric or specialty paper, and super-absorbent polymer can be used in gardening and flood barriers. P&G has no plans to use Fater’s output in its diapers, which include Pampers and Luvs, until it completes consumer research on the idea, Marinucci said. In the interim, he said, the company may use the plastics for bottle caps. The biggest delay to the project has been regulatory, Marinucci said, but he predicts it will get the EU green light in the next 12 months. In the meantime, after several years in development, Fater’s plant is operating at about a third of its 10,000-tonne annual capacity to provide samples and build stockpiles. The plant expects to generate annual revenue equal to 50 percent of the cost of its machinery, Marinucci said. “We’re working on well-grounded assumptions, but they’re still assumptions,” he said. If it works, it could be expanded. Government efforts to resolve the problem of plastics pollution gained urgency last year when China announced it would stop importing foreign waste. China in 2016 took in 7.3 million tonnes of waste plastics - 56 percent of world imports. Fater is not the first to attempt diaper recycling. UK-based Knowaste was forced to close its 70,000 tonne-per-year recycling plant in Holland in 2007 after a new incinerator beat it on cost and it was unable to find markets for the final product. Efforts to open another facility have failed so far but Knowaste continues to invest in technology and is now considering a plant in the Middle East. “We were way ahead of the curve and maybe went too soon. But the market is now showing clear signs of maturing,” said company CEO Roy Brown. Fater’s patented process starts with local waste management utility Contarina SpA, which collects used diapers and other AHP from curbside bins or large users like hospitals from more than 50 local towns, trucking them in to the 1,000-sq meter plant. After dry cleaning the diapers using contact steam and disposing of the human waste in waste water treatment plants, one ton of AHP waste can yield 150 kg of cellulose, 75 kg of absorbing material and 75 kg of mixed plastic. Starting at the end of 2020, a small-scale biorefinery in Amsterdam will be able to process the recovered secondary raw materials and convert them into biologically-based products like biodegradable plastics and biofertilizers. Guy Schanschieff, founder of UK-based reusable diaper brand Bambino Mio, says he has seen others try and fail to recycle diapers over the years. For one thing, busy parents can’t always deposit diapers in the required bins, he said. “At the end of the day, it’s a disposable product and it’s going to be thrown away,” said Schanschieff, who is also chairman of the Nappy Alliance trade group. “Not creating the waste in the first place is always going to be the best thing.”",0
"P&G, with roughly $68 billion in annual revenue, said it has invested millions in creating and testing refills for detergents over the years and is now trying to push in to mainstream beauty and body care refills – which are virtually  unheard of. It recently began offering some Olay face-cream jars with refill pouches on Olay.com, telling Reuters it has plans to expand the sales of the pouches in Europe early next year. “We’re learning on our legs so I don’t know that we’re in a position to say, ‘Hey, here’s the magic to selling refills,’” P&G spokesman Damon Jones said. Beauty products retailer The Body Shop, owned by Brazil’s Natura Cosmeticos SA NATU3.SA, says it plans to roll out “refill stations” in its stores globally next year, allowing shoppers to buy reusable metal containers to fill with Body Shop shower gels or creams. The company had offered refills at its stores in the early 1990s, but discontinued them in 2003, citing a lack of consumer demand. Unilever, which has set targets for reducing and recycling plastic by 2025, in October announced the planned launch of “refill sticks” of deodorants under its Dove line of personal care products on Loopstore.com. The website, operated by recycling company TerraCycle, offers consumers the chance to buy some household products in ultra-durable packaging with refills delivered to their doors, milkman-style. Across the consumer goods industry, results for refillable products have been mixed so far as many shoppers are far too set in their ways to be easily weaned from living in a throwaway culture. While refills are less expensive to purchase - generally priced at 20% to 30% less per item than the containers they are aimed to replenish, according to Unilever - shoppers have so far, for the most part, failed to snap them up, the companies said. SC Johnson & Son Inc, marketer of Windex and Pledge, said refills and concentrates so far have not played well with either Americans or Europeans over the decade they have been offered, with unit sales of such products pretty much flat. It pulled concentrated refills for Shout stain remover off the shelves because they were not selling very well. In 2010, Unilever put 20-liter tanks to dispense detergents in Walmart Inc’s (WMT.N) British supermarket chain Asda, and provided flexible pouches for customers to refill. But with leaky machines, safety and maintenance problems and the high costs of upkeep, Unilever said the tests fell short of expectations. Asda was also unhappy because the tanks occupied a lot of space. “None of them sell very well – it is a convenience issue,” SC Johnson CEO Fisk Johnson told Reuters. Johnson said some people find it painstaking to wash and refill bottles themselves while others worry that smaller bottles filled with concentrates are less “bang-for-your-buck” than the larger ones they have used for years. Still, the privately held company said it was expanding its refill offerings this year to address concerns surrounding plastic waste and is also testing refill stations for cleaning products with UK retailer Waitrose, owned by Britain’s John Lewis [JLPLC.UL]. The Waitrose tests are showing the first signs of progress in refill sales, Johnson said, and the company is now thinking of expanding the project. Even if consumers are comfortable using refills for some household goods, it is more complicated to sell them for products like Pantene shampoo and Olay creams, P&G spokesman Jones said. For instance, with beauty products, the look and feel of packaging is a big factor in creating and maintaining customer loyalty, while delivering an environmental benefit, he said. Some shoppers say they want to buy refillable products, but that the offerings are not available at many stores. Earlier this year, dozens of consumers took to social media to urge The Body Shop to bring back its refill counters. “Refill, refill, refill!” Twitter user @JaiChipperfield said on July 22, joining a thread in which several other shoppers demanded the return of refills. “Seems to me that judging by these comments your customers want to see the return of refills,” @JaiChipperfield added. “Me too, it would be brilliant to see that return.”  The Body Shop eventually responded to those pleas. “Now with the renewed focus on sustainability, we believe it is the right time to return with it,” Body Shop spokeswoman Lucy Muircroft told Reuters this week.",0
"“I saw news of trash overflowing the world...sea animals dying from eating plastic...I felt I must do something,” says the 48-year-old entrepreneur, who leads an online community of more than 20,000 people seeking to practice a waste-free lifestyle. But individual efforts alone can’t fully stop the 8 million tonnes of plastic that make their way to the ocean each year,  and with four of the five worst ocean polluters in Southeast Asia, the region’s governments must take action, he says. “Policymaking to address the issue must be treated with urgency as well,” said Thanaboon. A summit for leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) being hosted by Thailand this weekend is expected to adopt the Bangkok Declaration on Combating Marine Debris in ASEAN Region. Thailand, the current chair of the group, has lauded the declaration as a “big step” for the region, whose coasts have seen whales and sea turtles wash up dead in recent years with large amounts of plastic rubbish in their stomachs. ASEAN members Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand are among the five countries throwing the most plastic waste into oceans, according to a 2015 report co-authored by  environmental campaigner Ocean Conservancy. China is the worst offender. “Every ASEAN country agrees that marine debris is a common problem that we must address urgently,” Wijarn Simachaya, permanent secretary of Thailand’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, told Reuters. Unlike the European Union’s central bans and targets, Wijarn said the ASEAN declaration will outline broad ideas but it will be up to each country what it would take home to implement. The declaration will come ahead of next week’s G20 summit in Japan, which assembles 20 major economies and will also aim to tackle marine plastic pollution. Environmentalists welcomed ASEAN’s move to adopt the joint declaration, but there are worries that implementation will be a challenge, because the group has a code of non-interference that would leave necessary policymaking in the hands of individual member countries. “This declaration will be a new milestone, but it will be just words on paper if there is no change in policies,” Tara Buakamsri, director of Greenpeace Thailand, told Reuters. He said ASEAN countries should urgently all ban single-use plastic first for the declaration to be effective. “There is no other way,” Tara said. Globally, up to 5 trillion single-use plastic bags are used each year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Of 300 million tonnes of plastic waste the world produces annually, 8 million end up in the oceans, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, it says. According to Ocean Conservancy, 60 percent of the debris comes from China and the four ASEAN nations. “It’s a good step as this is the first time ASEAN formally acknowledges the issue of marine debris,” said marine biologist Thon Thamrongnawasawat. Each year, Thailand generates about 2 million tonnes of plastic waste, only about 25% of which gets recycled. The rest goes to incineration or landfill, where about 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes leaks into the ocean. Environmentalists commend initiatives by some major retailers to cut back on plastic bags, but say most businesses will not take action unless there is a stricter push from policy initiatives. CP All, which operates over 10,000 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country, said it has saved 464 million bags from circulation since December, donating more than 92 million baht saved from the process to public hospitals around the country. Thailand’s largest retail conglomerate Central Group said last month it aimed to reduce plastic bags by 150 million this year by giving customers rewards incentives. Governments should “act more drastically” by introducing immediate bans on single-use plastic so that more businesses follow suit, said Nattapong Nithi-Uthai, who leads volunteer network Trash Hero that cleans up the Gulf of Thailand in southern Pattani province. He also said ASEAN should aim to significantly improve its waste management schemes, as well as hold producers of consumer goods accountable. “There should be designated places for every single item to go. If things are piled up somewhere, they can leak into the ocean,” he said. “Producers should also be made responsible for taking back the single-use plastic they produce ... This might make them think twice about producing single-use packaging.”",0
"Warnings about the dangers of using cellular phones in the presence of gasoline fumes began circulating on the Internet in 1999: Examples: [Collected on the Internet, 1999] Cell Phones In case you do not know, there was an incident where a driver suffered burns and his car severely damaged when gasoline vapors ignited an explosion while he was talking on his mobile phone standing near the attendant who was pumping the gas. All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, (intrinsically safe) while cell phones are not. READ YOUR HANDBOOK! Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in “gas stations, fuel storage sites, and chemical factories.” Exxon has begun placing “warning stickers” at its gasoline stations. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users is primarily the result of their ability to produce sparks that can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone. Please pass this on. [Collected on the Internet, 1999] *** PASS THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS *** Mobile phones an explosive risk at gas stations. Switch off your mobile phone while filling your car. This is the latest advice for mobile phone users and gas station attendants alike from the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), which has recently informed all its affiliates to be on alert for people chatting on mobiles while pumping gas, a practice it asserts can cause explosions. “There have been several explosions in Southeast Asia and Europe and we hope similar tragedies can be avoided in Taiwan,” said David Tung from CPC’s main engineering division. According to a report released by Shell Chemicals, a driver in Indonesia suffered burns and his car was severely damaged when petrol vapor exploded after being ignited by static electricity from the mobile phone he was using. Apparently, the driver had been talking on a mobile phone as a gas station attendant filled his car with petrol. When the driver bent down close to the petrol tank to check whether it was full, the vapor exploded. In Belgium, customers have been prohibited from using mobile phones within 10 meters of gas stations and warnings are posted everywhere to remind people of the danger, according to a Belgian newspaper. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users around the world is largely due to their ability to produce sparks. These can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone, which is itself, a possible cause of fire. But the electromagnetic waves emitted by the phone are more than sufficient to create considerable static electricity that heats the surrounding air and if the flammable vapor is concentrated enough, causes an explosion. But other electronic devices installed in the gas stations are safe. “All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, while cellular phones are not,” Tung explained. Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in “gas stations, fuel storage sites and chemical factories.” But the danger is still being ignored by many users who continue to talk on their cellular phones while filling up at gas stations. “Asking them to turn off the phone is the only thing we can do now, but not all the users like to : some of them even get mad with me,” one attendant at a gas station complained. In fact, if danger is to be avoided, all transmitting devices – not just mobile phones – should be switched off near gas stations and locations housing flammable substances. Mobile phones should also be switched off near sensitive electronic equipment, in places such as hospitals and airports for public safety reasons. Taken from ‘The China Post’ by Chris Lang. Though both versions of the original Internet warning alluded to an accident in Indonesia wherein a driver was burned and his car badly damaged as a result of such an explosion, no reports ever surfaced in the news media to confirm the incident. Moreover, nothing turned up about similar explosions in other countries. If sparks from cell phones were touching off conflagrations at gas pumps around the world, as suggested at the time, the phenomenon escaped the media’s notice. Such rumors were furthered in May 1999 when a lengthy article appeared in the Bangkok Post supporting this warning. It mentioned “a recent report in the China Post newspaper” and from there proceeded to parrot the warning given in the longer example quoted above, complete with reference to the report by Shell Chemicals on the injuries suffered by the man in Indonesia and the Chinese Petroleum Corporation’s instructions to filling stations to get drivers to switch off their phones while fueling. Okay, so the bit about a guy in Indonesia being turned into a human fireball didn’t stand up. But what about persistent rumors concerning another supposed victim, this time an Australian man, supposedly done in by using his mobile phone as he refueled? Although in 1999 oil companies told the South China Morning Post they had heard reports of an Australian man being blown up recently when his phone rang as he was filling his car with gasoline, fire service heads in Australia insist the incident never happened. As for incidents elsewhere in the world, after several reports were circulated in the United States claiming mobile phones had been blamed for fires at gas stations, both the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and the American Petroleum Institute issued statements denying the risk. The CTIA said, “There is no evidence whatsoever that a wireless phone has ever caused ignition or explosion at a station anywhere in the world. Wireless phones don’t cause gas stations to blow up. Warnings being posted in petrol stations simply perpetuate the myth.” The American Petroleum Institute said, “We can find no evidence of someone using a cellphone causing any kind of accident, no matter how small, at a gas station anywhere in the world.” In June 2002 another authoritative-sounding warning on this subject began circulating on the Internet: The Shell Oil Company recently issued a warning about three incidents where Mobile Phones have ignited fumes while being answered or ringing during fueling operations. What specifically happenedCase 1 The phone was placed on the car’s trunk lid during fueling, it rang and the ensuing fire destroyed the car and the gasoline pump. Case 2 An individual suffered severe burns to their face when fumes ignited as they answered a call while refueling their car. Case 3 An individual suffered burns to the thigh and groin as fumes ignited when the phone, which was in their pocket, rang while they were fueling their car. What should you learn from this? It is a misconception that Mobile Phones are intrinsically safe and can’t ignite fuel/fumes. Mobile phones that light up when switched on, or when they ring, have enough energy released to provide a spark for ignition. Mobile phones should not be used in filling stations, or when fueling lawn mowers, boats etc. Mobile phones should not be used around other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust (i.e. solvents, chemicals, gases, grain dust etc.). Mobile phones should be turned off before entering an area where other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust is located. Please share this with employees who do not have access to email, family members and friends to help keep everyone safe. Though we looked long and hard, we never found documentation confirming any of the three incidents described in the that warning. Moreover, Shell denied having issued a warning of this nature: We understand that there is an email, purportedly official Shell communication, circulating which describes various incidents that are supposed to have occurred as a result of mobile phones ringing while at a retail station.Please be advised that the email in question does NOT originate from Shell Malaysia and we are unable to confirm any of the incidents quoted. There was a warning memo which originated at a Shell loading station in California, but it was issued only to caution employees about the potential dangers of static-related hazards at fueling stations; it said nothing about cell phones touching off fires. (The “three incidents” e-mail quoted above was teamed with a separate warning about the hazards posed by static electricity, a topic covered on our Static Quo page.) Okay, so it hasn’t happened yet. Is there still a potential, as yet unrealized risk in using cell phones while refueling? According to some experts, there is a danger that using a mobile phone near gas pumps could touch off an explosion, but not only have we found no real-life instances of such an explosion occurring, we don’t know anyone who has demonstrated experimentally that it’s even possible (including the folks at The Discovery Channel’s Mythbusters program). Even so, gas pumps in Australia bear stickers cautioning motorists to turn off their phones while refueling; Shell in Malaysia has affixed similar stickers to each of its gas pumps; numerous pumps in the U.S.A. are similarly adorned; Canada’s major gas pump operators have banned customers from using mobile phones while at the gas pump; and in 1999 the city of Cicero, Illinois, passed the first law in the USA banning the use of cellular phones at gas stations. All of this activity was in the nature of CYA cautions rather than a response to a documented hazard. Cellular phone manufacturers Nokia and Ericsson have said the risk is very small that something will happen when one uses a cell phone at a gas station, but since there is a risk, it should be counted. Nokia also said that the company has been recommending for a long time that mobile phones should be turned off while the car is being refueled. What it is about a cellular phone that could possibly trigger an explosion is difficult to fathom, however. The claim that the batteries used in a cellular phone can ignite gasoline seems specious, since cellular phone batteries are the same voltage as automobile batteries (12V D.C.) but deliver far less current. Likewise, the claim that a “cellular phone ringer uses more than 100 volts for excitation” is a curious artifact of the “regular” telephone era: cellular phones don’t have ringers; they produce audio tones that simulate the sound of a ringing telephone. News reports routinely attribute gas pump fires to cell phone use whenever a fire occurs at a service station where such a phone was in use at the time, and police and firefighters at the scene often simply assume the connection between the two to be valid. Later investigations, however, have always shown in such cases that the press reports were wrong, that something else (usually a discharge of static electricity) touched off the fires, and the presence of cell phones was coincidental rather than causal.",1
"Britain is the first G7 country to commit to a net zero greenhouse gas emissions target for 2050. “From driving our cars, to catching a train or taking a flight abroad, it is crucial that we ensure transport is as environmentally friendly as possible,” said transport secretary Grant Schapps. Due to be complete next year, the plan will set out in detail what government, business and society must do to deliver the significant emissions reductions needed from all forms of transport. It will also consider how technology can encourage changes to the way people and goods move across the country, the government said. Climate change activists, including one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, defied a police order to end protests on Tuesday after a week of disruption in London targeting Britain’s transport ministry. Among other things, the activists oppose plans to run the HS2 rail project through ancient woodlands. The transport ministry says the rail line will slash journey times between central and northern England and the capital and be much more efficient in carbon terms than driving. The government also introduced an environment bill in parliament on Tuesday to help create legally binding targets to protect the environment and reduce pollution. The bill will also establish an office for environment protection which will hold the government to account on its progress towards the 2050 net zero emissions target. Experts say the net zero target will require sweeping changes across the energy, transport, heating and buildings sectors. Britain’s business secretary Andrea Leadsom told a parliamentary committee the government would produce a long-awaited energy white paper in the first quarter of next year. That is expected to outline the government’s ambitions for the future of the country’s energy system. “I am very ambitious about our decarbonisation ambitions and the need to set targets and milestones to enable business to get on with it with a very clear steer from government,” Leadsom said.",0
"On 24 March 2016, social media users began sharing articles reporting that students at Emory University were “traumatized” by graffiti promoting Donald Trump, and that “emergency counseling” had been offered to those who felt their “safe spaces” had been violated. Many Twitter users linked to an article published about the controversy by the Emory Wheel, the university’s student-run newspaper. The term “counseling” only appeared in the item’s comments section, and “safe spaces” was included as a paraphrase (meaning the purportedly oversensitive students invoking the concept hadn’t actually used the words): Grievances were not restricted to shortcomings of the administration. “[Faculty] are supporting this rhetoric by not ending it,” said one student, who went on to say that “people of color are struggling academically because they are so focused on trying to have a safe community and focus on these issues [related to having safe spaces on campus].” What the article (prior to an update) described was a political protest inspired by the Trump graffiti: Students protested yesterday at the Emory Administration Building following a series of overnight, apparent pro-Donald Trump for president chalkings throughout campus. Roughly 40 students gathered shortly after 4:30 p.m. in the outdoors space between the Administration Building and Goodrich C. White Hall; many students carried signs featuring slogans such as “Stop Trump” or “Stop Hate”[.] A 23 March 2016 Mediate article was one of the first that reported students were offered not just counseling, but emergency counseling (as if some major catastrophe had occurred on campus): A group of students at Emory University led a campus-wide protest after someone wrote ‘Donald Trump 2016’ in chalk across campus, leading the university to provide “emergency counseling” sessions in response. According to student paper The Emory Wheel, the triggered students protested outside the administration building chanting, “You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!” However, the sole citation for the “counseling” claim was the same Emory Wheel article which, again, made no mention of any such offer or demand. Britain’s Daily Mail repeated the “emergency counseling” claim, but that site also linked to Emory University content, which itself made no such statement: After the chalk markings started to appear, and pictures began appearing on The Tab, student organizations offered counselling to anyone who may have been impacted by what they had seen. Mediaite linked to Fox Sports, which claimed (in its own words) that “[t]he student government association is OFFERING EMERGENCY COUNSELING FOR STUDENTS TRIGGERED BY THE TRUMP 2016 CAMPUS CHALKINGS.” Fox Sports then reproduced an e-mail sent by student government representatives (i.e. students, not adult faculty or administrators) offering support for events, not counseling: That being said, by nature of the fact that for a significant portion of our student population, the messages represent particularly bigoted opinions, policies, and rhetoric directed at populations represented at Emory University, we would like to express our concern regarding the values espoused by the messages displayed, and our sympathy for the pain experienced by members of our community… It is clear to us that these statements are triggering for many of you. As a result, both College Council and the Student Government Association pledge to stand in solidarity with those communities who feel threatened by this incident and to help navigate the student body through it and the environment of distrust and unease it has created. To that end, Emergency Funds within the College Council monetary policy were created to provide time-sensitive funds during circumstances involving discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and such funds are available to any student organization looking to sponsor events in response to this incident. In context, it seemed much more likely that the e-mail described protest events, not counseling (which was never originally insinuated). Some attention focused on Emory’s efforts to identify the rogue Trump chalker, but the Emory Wheel made clear that the actions were in dispute because use of chalk to mark structures is only permitted on certain campus areas. The Trump chalkings appeared campus-wide, and therefore broke rules about acceptable use of chalk on campus: The University will review footage “up by the hospital [from] security cameras” to identify those who made the chalkings, Wagner told the protesters. He also added that if they’re students, they will go through the conduct violation process, while if they are from outside of the University, trespassing charges will be pressed. While it was true that several dozen Emory University students protested in response to the Trump chalk scrawlings, we were unable to substantiate that anyone (student or administrator) offered emergency counseling, or, indeed, counseling or any sort. Neither did anyone seek counseling that we could see, and no students complained “safe spaces” were violated (though at least one said they felt “unsafe”). The Emory University media brouhaha was one of several distorted claims of rampant political correctness on college campuses and elsewhere, with several (embellished) details repeated by major outlets such as the Daily Mail, Mediaite, and the Washington Post. Just a few weeks before the Emory controversy, several web sites inaccurately claimed students were offered counseling over the presence of mini sombreros at a party. Another viral Facebook post claimed Captain America was deemed offensive and banned; a Brooklyn principal was falsely accused of banning the Pledge of Allegiance, Thanksgiving, and Christmas; and another faux outrage popped up over a satirical poster claiming popular Halloween costumes were not politically correct and kids wearing them would be denied candy. In nearly all such claims, details of the actual controversy were obfuscated by embellished elements framing students or schools as overly sensitive. While it was true some students of color expressed that the large number of Trump chalkings made them uneasy, most simply gathered to express their political distaste for the presidential candidate and his platforms on issues of race and religion. On 25 March 2016, Emory protest organizer Jonathan Peraza contacted us and linked to a 24 March 2016 statement about the controversy issued by involved students on campus: Subsequent media reports have tried to frame this case as one about “coddled” and “oversensitive” students; however, LET US BE CLEAR: We are not scared of the chalk. We are not mad about being politically challenged. We are rightfully angry because we also exercise our first amendment right to freedom of speech and there are people on this campus, and in this country, who as a result choose to threaten us and twist the truth to protect their own bigotry. Firstly, we are not asking that these students censor their politics, nor are we asking that administration chooses to intervene in student politics. Rather, what we are asking for is equality and equity — we want a streamlined, consistent method of communication to deal with instances of unrest on Emory’s campus. This means race, color and economic status should not determine whether or not the University needs to be prompted to send out a response of acknowledgement of events. Secondly, we ask the Emory University Student Body and individuals nationally to fight for our right of freedom of speech the way they have for Trump supporters.",1
"On 11 August 2017, dubious site Proud-Patriots.com falsely reported that the family of California senator (and Senate President Pro Tempore) Kevin de León had been targeted for deportation by President Donald Trump because they are allegedly all undocumented: The Democrats are not immune to survive [sic] the huge pressure on them and their followers from the new laws for illegal immigrants. The DNC opposed every law which confronts their open borders agenda. Kevin de Leon, a California Democrat State Senate leader admitted that with this new reform, half of his family is unlawfully on US soil. The article uses quotes from a speech given by de León on 31 January 2017, in which he said: …The reality is, with the executive order and the criteria that has been developed, many individuals – I can tell you, half of my family would be eligible for deportation under the executive order. Because, if they got a false social security card, if they got a false identification, if they got a false driver’s license prior to us passing AB-60, if they got a false green card. And anyone who has family members who are undocumented knows that almost entirely everybody has secured some sort of false identification, that’s what you need to survive, to work – they are eligible for massive deportation. De León’s remarks related to a 25 January 2017 executive order signed by Donald Trump, which ordered the enhancement of immigration law enforcement, especially in so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions. The article offers no evidence that either President Trump or Immigration and Customs Enforcement had targeted or was about to target members of de León’s family. Furthermore, a spokesperson for de León told us that the family members to whom the senator was referring have already become naturalized United States citizens or permanent residents. The Senator generalized that half his family would have been eligible for deportation under Trump’s new standards. Those members were naturalized during the Reagan era and are now citizens or permanent residents.",1
"Dr. Leon Eisenberg, who passed away at the age of 87 in 2009, was a prominent figure in the field of child psychiatry who during the 1950s and 60s conducted medical studies of children with developmental problems, including some of the first rigorous studies of autism and attention deficit disorder. As described by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), Dr. Eisenberg “transformed child psychiatry by advocating research into developmental problems”: Early in his medical career, in the mid-1950s, Leon Eisenberg became fascinated with the childhood mind. Wanting to know more, he broke free from the shackles of the Freudian psychoanalytic dogma that dominated child psychiatry at the time to conduct groundbreaking biologically based research of childhood developmental problems. This research included the first randomised clinical drug trials in child psychiatry. “I think what Leon brought to the field was a different way of thinking — thinking out of the box,” said David DeMaso, chairman of psychiatry at Boston Children’s Hospital and professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “He was thinking in terms of biology, of evidence based treatment, way before anybody else. His was a bio-psycho-social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was the norm.” Eisenberg’s direct involvement as a child psychiatry researcher was over by 1967, when he moved to Harvard Medical School as chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. But in a dozen years he had helped transform the discipline. Although describing Dr. Eisenberg as the “inventor” or “father” of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and/or attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might be challenged by some as a bit of an exaggeration, he unquestionably contributed a great deal to the body of knowledge on which modern diagnoses and treatment of those disorders is based. Given Dr. Eisenberg’s recognized authority and expertise in this field, therefore, those who feel that ADD and ADHD are misused and over-employed diagnoses which serve to “excuse bullying and recklessness” and “offer a sense of alleviation of personal responsibility among those diagnosed” would indeed find validation if Dr. Eisenberg had proclaimed “ADHD is a fictitious disease”: Example: [Collected via e-mail, May 2013] I’ve been seeing this story making the rounds about how the alleged “inventor” of ADHD (a Dr. Eisenberg) had a sort of deathbed confession, and, in an interview with Der Spiegel 7 months before he died at 87, said, “ADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease.” Leon Eisenberg, the father of ADHD, is quoted as saying in Der Spiegel that “ADHD is a fictitious disease” (shortly before his death). The claim that Dr. Eisenberg asserted “ADHD is a fictitious disease” is reproduced on countless web sites as something he said “seven months before his death in his last interview,” which would place the date of his utterance around February 2009. When documentation for the putative quote is provided, it references an article (often described as a “cover story”) published in the German weekly Der Spiegel on 2 February 2012. We found that the German-language version of Der Spiegel ran an article in 2012 that skeptically examined the large increase in diagnoses of mental disorders in recent years and quoted Dr. Eisenberg on that subject. A software-based translation of that article from German to English does describe Dr. Eisenberg as the “father of ADHD” and report that during his “last interview” he said something similar to “ADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease.” However, when one allows for the vagaries of translation from German to English and reads the statement in context, it’s clear that Dr. Eisenberg wasn’t asserting that ADHD isn’t a real disorder, but rather that he thought the influence of genetic predispositions for ADHD (rather than social/environmental risk factors) were vastly overestimated: One out of every ten 10-year-old boys already takes an ADHD drug daily. But the scientific father of ADHD has followed the explosion of prescriptions with growing horror. Leon Eisenberg took over the management of psychiatry at the prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and became one of the most famous psychiatrists in the world. In his last interview, seven months before his death from prostate cancer at the age of 87, he distanced himself from his youthful indiscretion. A tall, thin man with glasses and suspenders opened the door to his apartment in Harvard Square in 2009, invited me to the kitchen table, and poured coffee. He said that he never would have thought his discovery would someday become so popular. “ADHD is a prime example of a fabricated disorder,” Eisenberg said. “The genetic predisposition to ADHD is completely overrated.” Instead, child psychiatrists should more thoroughly determine the psychosocial reasons that can lead to behavioral problems, Eisenberg said. Are there fights with parents, are there are problems in the family? Such questions are important, but they take a lot of time, Eisenberg said, adding with a sigh: “Prescribe a pill for it very quickly.” On a related note, an August 2012 Der Spiegel English-language interview with (now retired) Harvard psychologist Dr. Jerome Kagan quoted Dr. Kagan as being critical of “fuzzy diagnostic practices” and the over-prescription of drugs such as Ritalin for behavioral problems in children, and as referring to ADHD as “an invention”: SPIEGEL: In the 1960s, mental disorders were virtually unknown among children. Today, official sources claim that one child in eight in the United States is mentally ill. Kagan: That’s true, but it is primarily due to fuzzy diagnostic practices. Let’s go back 50 years. We have a 7-year-old child who is bored in school and disrupts classes. Back then, he was called lazy. Today, he is said to suffer from ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). That’s why the numbers have soared. SPIEGEL: Experts speak of 5.4 million American children who display the symptoms typical of ADHD. Are you saying that this mental disorder is just an invention? Kagan: That’s correct; it is an invention. Every child who’s not doing well in school is sent to see a pediatrician, and the pediatrician says: “It’s ADHD; here’s Ritalin.” In fact, 90 percent of these 5.4 million kids don’t have an abnormal dopamine metabolism. The problem is, if a drug is available to doctors, they’ll make the corresponding diagnosis.",0
"“Black Friday” is the (originally derisive, now mainstream) term for the phenomenon that takes place in the U.S. on the day after Thanksgiving Thursday, when millions of consumers who get the day off from work or school crowd into stores for what is traditionally considered the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. The origins of the term “Black Friday” have become somewhat obscured in the mists of time, however, leading people to invent fanciful explanations for how that phrase became attached to the day after Thanksgiving. One example posits that the term started with a tradition of slaveowners or slave traders using that day as an opportunity for selling their wares:  The use of “Black Friday” as a descriptor for the day after Thanksgiving has nothing to do with the selling of slaves, though, and the term didn’t originate until nearly a century after the practice of slavery was abolished in the U.S. The earliest known use of “Black Friday” in such a context stems from 1951 and referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving in order to have four consecutive days off (because that day was not yet commonly offered as a paid day off by employers): WHAT TO DO ABOUT “FRIDAY AFTER THANKSGIVING” “Friday-after-Thanksgiving-itis” is a disease second only to the bubonic plague in its effects. At least that’s the feeling of those who have to get production out, when the “Black Friday” comes along. The shop may be half empty, but every absentee was sick — and can prove it. What to do? Many companies have tried the standard device of denying Thanksgiving Day pay to employees absent the day before and after the holiday. Trouble is, you can’t deny pay to those legitimately ill. But what’s legitimate? Tough to decide these days of often miraculously easy doctors’ certificates. Glenn L. Martin, Baltimore aircraft manufacturer has another solution: When you decide you want to sweeten up the holiday kitty, pick Black Friday to add to the list. That’s just what Martin has done. Friday after Thanksgiving is the company’s seventh paid holiday. We’re not suggesting more paid holidays just to get out of a hole. But, if you can make a good trade in bargaining, there are lots of worse things than having a holiday on a day that was half holiday anyway. Shouldn’t cost too much for that reason, either. By 1961 the term “Black Friday” (and “Black Saturday” as well) was being commonly used in a derisive sense by Philadelphia police, who had to deal with the mayhem and headaches caused by all the extra pedestrian and vehicular traffic created by hordes of shoppers heading for the city’s downtown stores on the two days after Thanksgiving: For downtown merchants throughout the nation, the biggest shopping days normally are the two following Thanksgiving Day. Resulting traffic jams are an irksome problem to the police and, in Philadelphia, it became customary for officers to refer to the post-Thanksgiving days as Black Friday and Black Saturday. In a 1994 article, former Philadelphia Bulletin reporter Joseph P. Barrett recalled how he took part in popularizing the term “Black Friday” throughout Philadelphia in the early 1960s, from which it eventually spread into nationwide usage: The term “Black Friday” came out of the old Philadelphia Police Department’s traffic squad. The cops used it to describe the worst traffic jams which annually occurred in Center City on the Friday after Thanksgiving. It was the day that Santa Claus took his chair in the department stores and every kid in the city wanted to see him. It was the first day of the Christmas shopping season. Schools were closed. Late in the day, out-of-town visitors began arriving for the Army-Navy football game. Every “Black Friday,” no traffic policeman was permitted to take the day off. The division was placed on 12 hours of duty, and even the police band was ordered to Center City. It was not unusual to see a trombone player directing traffic. Two officers were assigned to intersections along Market Street to control the throngs of pedestrians. The department also placed police officers outside parking garages because the “lot filled” signs failed to deter motorists from lining up on the curb lane outside the garage. This reduced street size from two lanes to one. This caused traffic to back up and block traffic at the next intersection. This caused massive gridlock. In 1959, the old Evening Bulletin assigned me to police administration, working out of City Hall. Nathan Kleger was the police reporter who covered Center City for the Bulletin. In the early 1960s, Kleger and I put together a front-page story for Thanksgiving and we appropriated the police term “Black Friday” to describe the terrible traffic conditions. [W]e used it year after year. Then television picked it up. One popular alternative explanation for the origins of “Black Friday” is that it is the day on which retailers finally began to show a profit for the year (in accounting terms, moving from being “in the red” to “in the black”) after operating at an overall loss from January through mid-November: If the day is the year’s biggest for retailers, why is it called Black Friday? Because it is a day retailers make profits — black ink, said Grace McFeeley of Cherry Hill Mall. “I think it came from the media,” said William Timmons of Strawbridge & Clothier. “It’s the employees, we’re the ones who call it Black Friday,” said Belle Stephens of Moorestown Mall. “We work extra hard. It’s a long hard day for the employees.”",1
"A man lights a friend's cigarette as they stand in front of an advertisement for the China World shopping mall in central Beijing March 22, 2011. REUTERS/David Gray China, which has more than 300 million smokers, will require businesses to display prominent no-smoking signs, forbid vending machines from selling cigarettes and ensure that designated outdoor smoking zones not affect pedestrian traffic, according to a ministry statement reported in Chinese media on Thursday. Businesses should educate customers about the health hazards of smoking and workers should attempt to stop smokers from lighting up, the ministry said. The ministry did not state specific penalties — a sign that the new ban might not be rigorously enforced. China, the world’s largest cigarette producer, has embarked on years of half-hearted campaigns to stub out the habit in some cities. The government previously it would ban smoking in all hospitals and medical facilities from 2011. In 2008, Beijing formally pledged to restrict smoking in most public venues in the city, including government offices and public transport, but most of these venues remain choked with smoke and non-smoking signs are routinely ignored. In the southern city of Guangzhou, smokers who light up in certain public places only have to pay a 50 yuan ($7.625) fine, a limited deterrent in one of China’s richest cities, even as state news agency Xinhua dubbed it “the nation’s toughest smoking ban.”   Although nearly 1.2 million Chinese people die from smoking-related diseases each year, the habit is deeply entrenched in public life. Chinese cigarettes, among the cheapest in the world, are considered an important part of socializing. More than half of all male Chinese doctors smoke. Less smoking could reduce smoking-related health costs, but would also hurt government revenue, as the tobacco industry provides nearly one-tenth of tax revenues. ($1 = 6.558 Chinese yuan)",0
"""While debating abortion rights, a Republican Florida House member made a startling claim: Doctors who perform abortions are to blame for reducing the African-American population in the United States. """"In America alone, without the Nazi Holocaust, without the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and other abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973,"""" said the House member, Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights. Van Zant is sponsoring a bill (HB 845) that would criminalize abortions performed because of the race or sex of the fetus, and during debate, he suggested that abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood are targeting African-Americans. Do statistics about the African-American population in the United States support his claim? What we found in this case is that Van Zant makes a complicated, and largely unsubstantiated leap of logic. Taken at its most literal meaning, his statement is preposterous. The black population grew by 67 percent, not decreased by 25 percent, from 1973 to 2010, according to U.S. Census figures. Interpreting his statement the way Van Zant and other anti-abortion groups intend -- that the U.S. black population would be at least 25 percent higher were it not for Roe v. Wade -- is also fraught with problems. To start, federal data for abortions is imprecise, and that’s not even factoring in the additional layer of abortions by race. Van Zant’s claim is largely based on guesstimates. Then there’s the bigger issue of arguing that every fetus would be alive today had the pregnancy not have been aborted, a premise social scientists called over-simplified and inaccurate. We’ll take you through it. How does Van Zant get there? Van Zant’s legislative aide gave us a packet of information relating to his remarks, including print-outs from Abort73.com, an antiabortion advocacy group, on abortion and race. Here, we found a similarly worded version of Van Zant’s claim. """"From 1973 to 2012, abortion reduced the black population by 30 percent, and that doesn’t even factor in all the children that would have been born to those aborted a generation ago,"""" Abort73.com states. The website explains how it gets to 30 percent (we’re not vouching for the methodology, mind you): 17 million black babies were aborted since Roe v. Wade (55 million total abortions, as reported by National Right to Life, multiplied by 31 percent, which is what they say is the average rate of abortions by black women since 1973). The black population (people who identified as only black, not a combination of races, to the Census) was around 39 million people in 2010. So the black population, once you include 17 million would-be babies, should be 56 million people. That’s how they get the talking point. So is it reasonable or accurate? Data limitations and manipulations The U.S. Census Bureau, not surprisingly, does not come up with projections for what a population would have been without abortions. (We checked.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have a complete record of the number of abortions on black mothers since Roe v. Wade. We knew from the start the agency’s abortion data is incomplete, as not every state reports abortion data to the feds. Florida, for example, reports its abortions but does not break down the mother’s race or age. The center, which only started collecting racial/ethnic abortion data from state health departments in 1990, compiled this spreadsheet for us, emphasizing it has many caveats. By the CDC’s count, there have been 39.3 million abortions since 1973. Between 1990 and 2009, 4 million of those were by black women. We checked with the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion and uses a different method to count abortions. Instead of collecting data from state health departments, the Guttmacher Institute surveys a sample of abortion providers every few years. From 1973 to 2008, the most recent year for which their data is available, nearly 50 million legal abortions occurred in the United States. The Guttmacher Institute also does not have a total for abortions by race and ethnicity since 1973, as the group started collecting demographic data of women obtaining abortions in 1994. Their findings do not offer totals, just a proportion of abortions to each racial group. In 2008, white women accounted for 36 percent of abortions, black women for 30 percent, Hispanic women for 25 percent and non-Hispanic women of other races for 9 percent, according to Guttmacher’s tally. Not so simple There is one thing not up for debate: If all of the black women who had abortions had decided to carry their pregnancies to term, there would be more black people alive today. But Van Zant’s number is considerably inflated, social scientists told us. """"The claim that all terminated pregnancies would be alive today is ,"""" said Elwood Carlson, a Florida State University sociology professor who specializes in demography for reproductive health, adult mortality and family. Some of the pregnancies would have ended by stillbirths and spontaneous abortions, which end an estimated 15 to 20 percent of pregnancies, said Karin Brewster, director of FSU’s Center for Demography and Population Health. Plus, black Floridians are twice as likely as white Floridians to have spontaneous pregnancy losses, Carlson said. And even among the pregnancies ending with birth, some of those babies would have died as infants. The rate of infant death after live birth is also twice as high for black Floridians as for white Floridians, he said. Further, he said, the risk of involuntary death for black Floridians is twice as high as the risk to white Floridians from conception through adulthood. """"Induced abortions are only the tip of an iceberg of unequal life chances faced by black citizens of Florida, an iceberg that has been part of life in the state for at least the last half-century and which is showing no signs of drifting away,"""" he said. Elwood criticized Van Zant for isolating black abortions and not also mentioning there would be more white, Hispanic and Asian citizens if not for abortion. Other criticisms from the sources we consulted said it is inappropriate to take correlational data and make causal inferences, and that we don’t know what effect an abortion has on subsequent family planning. Some of the people counted in 2010 may not have been conceived had their mothers elected to carry their first pregnancy. Before we close, we’ll point out that Van Zant’s claim does not bolster his case that minority abortions happen because of race, as most abortions are performed because the mother cannot afford a child or having a child would interfere with other responsibilities at work, school or to other children. Our ruling Van Zant made a fiery case for his bill preventing gender- and race-based abortions, saying abortion providers like Parent Parenthood -- without the Nazis or the KKK --  """"have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973."""" Van Zant’s statement is wildly incorrect by the most literal measure -- the African-American population has increased since 1973. There’s also problems with the claim if you buy into Van Zant’s logic. Namely, abortion statistics are incomplete and/or difficult to interpret. And there’s no one-to-one correlation between an abortion and the population today.""",1
"Experimental health tests don’t have public price tags. However, this story gives readers a rare and helpful ballpark estimate, and one that compares it to an alternative (ultrasound): “It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,” a study author told BuzzFeed. The story lists out many of the details about what the researchers measured, and how those results compare to the current standard assessment tools, such as ultrasound. Readers don’t get a sense of what harms a false-positive test might expose a mother and her child too, and the rate here (nearly 17%) is rather high. Based on studies of the alternative test method — i.e. ultrasound — the risks of false-positive test/misdiagnosis include high stress and anxiety, depression, expensive and unnecessary treatments, and other possible harms. (The most common interventions for increased risk of preterm birth include progesterone supplements and bedrest.) For a story targeting the general public, all of our skeptical itches are scratched in this criterion. We’re told in fairly plain English how the tests works to pick up genetic material, and that it’s already used by other blood tests. We also get a short synopsis of the study’s limitations, with the story describing how it was small (with 38 women) and didn’t include ethnicities other than white or black. Finally, some rare yet illustrative numbers on efficacy are provided: false-positive results (3 in 18 pregnancies were supposedly at risk but became full-term) and false-positive results (4 in 5 did become at-risk preterm pregnancies). These types of details stated in plain language really help readers make sense of an otherwise complex study. The story describes some scary risks related to preterm deliveries, but nothing unwarranted to establish why a test for potential preterm deliveries might be important. We don’t get a crucial outside perspective on the study; the only source named in the story is one of the lead authors. On the plus side, the story is very thorough given its short length, and it offers a blunt if not skeptical summary on the research. It also helps that we’re told the study was funded by the March of Dimes and “other nonprofit sources,” and that the authors have applied to patent the blood test, implying they stand to profit from its approval and widespread use. BuzzFeed’s story establishes early on that ultrasound tests are the go-to method for determining pregnancies that are at-risk for preterm delivery, among other complications. It also gives the accuracy of that test as a measure (48%) and compares it to the experimental test’s accuracy (45%). The story is clear about the test’s availability in above-the-fold copy, stating it “is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab.” There’s even a reference to it being experimental in the story summary. (But why not include “experimental” in the headline, too?) The story references other unnamed blood tests that use cfRNA, though it clinches the novelty of the experimental preterm pregnancy test through an anecdote from one of the researchers. However, the story does not comment on other biomarkers (blood tests to detect factors correlated with preterm birth). As context, there have been many other biomarkers studied that have not proven to have clinical utility. Over 72 studies of biomarkers involving almost 90,000 women were examined in a 2011 review, which concluded that none, alone or in combination, were clinically useful to predict spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic women. There is much more work to be done to establish whether this new test performs well, and readers need that critical context. We didn’t detect any obvious signs of copy/pasting claims, researcher quotes, etc.",0
"Like many other claims about Hillary Clinton’s health during the 2016 election, rumors that Clinton canceled a campaign event after exhibiting “bizarre eye movements” are unfounded. The rumor started with a video that was posted to a YouTube channel dedicated to Clinton conspiracy theories on September 22nd. The video shows a slow-motion close-up of Clinton’s eyes while she spoke at an event in Philadelphia on September 19th, and a caption states: Hillary Clinton began to exhibit bizarre eye movement and strabismus (crossed eyes) during her speech in Philadelphia yesterday before unexpectedly canceling today’s scheduled events. It’s true that Clinton postponed a fundraising lunch planned in North Carolina a day after her speech in Philadelphia — but no reason was given by Clinton’s campaign, CBS affiliate WNCN reports: Meanwhile, Clinton campaign officials said Monday afternoon that a Tuesday fundraiser in Chapel Hill was postponed. The Clinton event was billed as “lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton” and had four donation levels to attend. Those contribution levels were described as $100,000, which featured “chair reception with Hillary,” $33,000, which included a “host reception with Hillary,” $5,000, which included “preferred seating” and $2,700. No reason was given for postponement of the Clinton event, which was planned to take place at the home of Betty Craven and Michael Warner. The notion that Clinton suffers from strabismus dates back to a head injury she suffered in a December 2012 fall. Bill Clinton was quoted as saying the injury “required six months of very serious work to get over” back in 2014. Clinton’s political opponents, including Karl Rove, argued that there were long-term effects of the head injury that could affect her judgment and ability to serve as president (Rove later backed off from those claims, but they still persist today). The American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Stabismus reports that stroke is the leading cause of strabismus in adults, but it can also be the result of brain damage that impairs eye control or damage to nerves that control the eyes. However, Clinton doesn’t appear to exhibit strabismus in the viral YouTube video. The video does not appear to show horizontal strabismus (cross eyes) or vertical strabismus (a lazy eye) — which are the two main types. Rather, the video is extremely zoomed in and plays in slow motion so it looks strange when Clinton looks from side to side while she talks. A full video of the speech can be viewed here, and Clinton’s eyes don’t look unusual when it’s played in real time. It’s not clear why Clinton canceled her North Carolina fundraiser, but video of her at the rally in Philadelphia doesn’t appear to match strabismus. That’s why we’re reporting this one as fiction.",1
"The story mentions the total amount that Americans spent on chondroitin supplements ($810 million in 2005), but not the individual's cost of purchasing the pills. The story states that chondroitin is no better than placebo, a conclusion that might seem difficult to quantify. But the authors of the analysis illustrate this non-difference nicely in a piece of data missing in the news report. The effect of chondroitin on pain, they found, was equivalent to an improvement of 0.6 millimeters on a 10-centimeter scale—in other words, extremely tiny. The story notes that there were no side effects from chondroitin and quotes an editorialist explaining that there was no harm in taking the supplements if patients felt they migh relieve pain. The news story mentions that the research analysis focused on three of the “largest and most complete studies.” It's interesting to note the limitations and flaws of the other 17 studies that the researchers did not analyze. In addition to being small, as the news story notes, these randomized, double-blind trials showed tremendous variance in their results, did not adequately conceal from patients whether they received chondroitin or placebo, and failed to include dropouts in their analyses. The story contained no elements of disease mongering. Osteoarthritis afflicts some 20 million Americans. It’s an important and often painful and disabling disease. The story includes quotes from interviews with two good sources—the lead author of the new research paper and a spokesperson for a trade group for supplement makers. It also cites an accompanying editorial in the journal that published the research. The news story notes that glucosamine is used to treat osteoarthritis (alone or in combination with chondroitin), but neglects to mention other nonoperative strategies that help patients cope with arthritis pain. These include analgesics, exercise and physical therapy, devices such as canes and braces, and others. The news story mentions that chondroitin is a dietary supplement, suggesting that it is available in stores that sell supplements. Readers should be able to infer that chondroitin is not an entirely novel therapy, since there are already at least 20 randomized trials examining its purported benefits. The story did not appear to rely solely or largely on a news release.",0
"This story ran in the U.S. edition of the Guardian. Generally, we expect those stories to acknowledge that the U.S. patients have to pay for their healthcare, and what those costs might be. However, in this case, because the research is looking at some benefits specific to the UK’s National Health Service, we’ll rate this N/A. It does include a small mention on this topic: “Partial replacements are also cheaper, say researchers from Oxford University.” The story tells readers that “Many more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster.” But it doesn’t tell readers how much faster. It also doesn’t make clear what the benefits of the surgery are compared to, well, not having any surgery at all. In addition to not quantifying the benefits, the story also doesn’t tell readers exactly what the researchers were measuring, which were “quality adjusted life years” (QALYs). QALYs are a way of accounting for both the quantity and quality of a patient’s life, and are used primarily in an economic context. i.e., QALYs are used to assess the cost-effectiveness, or value, of a medical procedure. In this case, the study found that patients had QALY gains for partial replacements, compared to total knee replacements, and that the gains varied depending on both the patient’s sex and age. The QALY outcomes were also influenced by whether the person conducting the partial surgery did such operations frequently. What risks are associated with getting either surgery? The story simply doesn’t tell us. When considering harms, one needs to keep in mind the side effects of surgery, the recovery from surgery, how they function after recovery and then whether there are differences in the need for subsequent procedures. It’s not clear from the story how the study was conducted. In one place it refers to “an analysis of the data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry.” Elsewhere the story cites a researcher as saying that the study was “able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their [general practitioner] visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible.” But, put simply, that’s rather vague. What sort of data were they looking at? How were they using the data? Were there limitations in the data that required researchers to make any assumptions? The story doesn’t tell us. Ideally, such analyses would use experimental data. However, this study uses observational data. Little is provided about where this data came from and how patients who had one procedure or the other differed. The lack of details makes it harder for the reader to understand what was done in this study. One possible concern here would be that there is an assumption that surgery — either partial or total replacement — is a foregone conclusion for patients who have osteoarthritis of the knee. That’s not true — there are other treatment options available. However, the story doesn’t quite say that. It instead says that osteoarthritis is “the main reason for [knee replacement] surgery.” Because there are certainly cases of osteoarthritis where replacement, or partial replacement, are indicated — and it can be inferred that the story is referring only to those cases — this gets a satisfactory rating. The story does not appear to incorporate input from any independent sources. All the quotes were taken from the news release, without attribution. If, as we noted under “Disease Mongering,” the story is focused only on patients that require either partial or total knee replacement, then the only alternatives are, well, partial or total knee replacement. And the story refers explicitly to both. But there are nuances missing. The partial procedure is thought to be a simpler one. As such, it may lead patients to undergo surgery at an earlier stage than they may otherwise have if they had the full replacement. As such, an alternative of waiting would be reasonable. This really is the challenge. There are few things between conservative measures and surgery for patients with knee arthritis. The story makes clear that partial knee replacement surgery is available. This is not the first study to evaluate the outcomes of partial knee procedures (see this 2011 paper, for example). It is not even the first study to compare the outcomes from partial surgery to the outcomes from total knee replacements (see these two studies on the same cohort of patients from 1998 and 2009). So what sets this new study apart? The story does cite a researcher as saying “The main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible.” However, without at least some discussion of the previous work, any comparison is impossible. It appears that all of the information in the story, including the quotes from the study authors, comes from a news release issued by the study authors’ research institution. The story does not credit the news release. For example, this quote appears in both the news story and the news release: “The main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible.”",1
"The run-up to Christmas coincides with peak demand for the delicacy, France’s favorite festive treat, made from duck or goose liver. Marie-Pierre Pe from foie gras makers group CIFOG, said on Monday that prices could be 10 percent higher this Christmas after the French government’s decision last year to cull all ducks and geese, and halt output for four months, in a bid to contain the virus. Farmers hope that stricter measures in place at French farms to spare birds from contamination after last year’s crisis will better protect their industry should the current outbreak of the H5N8 strain, already seen in neighboring Germany and Switzerland and other European countries, hit France. “When I heard about new bird flu cases in Europe, I thought: It can’t be true, the nightmare is not going to start all over again,” Pe told Reuters. “We did all that is needed to prepare farmers since the start of the year but we are never immune from birds contaminating a farm,” she said. Producers estimate the freezing of output had cost the industry around 500 million euros ($539 million), including a 270 million euros loss in sales and additional costs for new biosecurity material. The 25 percent drop in output and higher costs will lead to the rise in prices of foie gras products this year, Pe said. Sold whole or as a pate, foie gras is considered a gourmet food in Western and Asian cuisine, but the practice of force-feeding has often been criticized as cruel by animal activists. CIFOG held regular meetings with farmers this year to explain biosecurity measures put in place after the crisis, such as better protecting food and water from wild birds, Pe said. Farmers in southwestern France, the top foie gras producing region, also face stricter rules to avoid contamination between farms, notably through equipment disinfection. As well as Germany and Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Croatia, have also reported outbreaks of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu in recent weeks. No case of bird flu has been found in France so far this time but the country raised surveillance measures on Thursday to keep wild migrating birds from transmitting the virus to farm poultry. Denmark ordered farmers to keep their poultry indoors on Monday due to the bird flu threat and Germany said it was considering ordering farmers to keep their flocks inside.",0
"Arizona Senate candidate Bobby Wilson brought up an extraordinary personal take on the issue of gun violence during a public meeting in July 2018, describing the time, 55 years earlier, when he had used a gun to defend himself against a crazed attacker: The only way to stop a crazy madman from killing innocent people is you better have a good guy there with a gun. And I’m here to tell you I’m living proof of that … When I was 18 years old, somebody was hell-bent on killing me in my sleep one night. At three o’clock in the morning, I woke up to find a rifle in my face — a semi-automatic rifle, at that — and the bullets start[ed] flying, and I started diving for cover. I dodged six bullets before I managed to crawl under my bed where I kept a loaded, single-shot .22 [rifle]. And except for that single-shot .22, I would be dead. I would’ve been dead in 1963. Here’s how an Arizona Daily Star reporter tweeted about the account Wilson gave at that meeting: Wilson, who is repeatedly booed by the audience for various reasons (including saying everyone is good Christians) describes how he was nearly killed in his bed by a man who broke into his home, wanted to kill him. Wilson was able to shoot with a loaded gun he kept under his bed. pic.twitter.com/b0djHCXYLb — Joe Ferguson (@joeferguson) July 10, 2018  What Wilson didn’t convey during that meeting was that the person who allegedly tried to kill him as he slept was his own mother, whom Wilson shot dead. Nor did he mention the fact that his teenaged sister was beaten to death in the same incident. However, his extraordinary anecdote prompted an investigation by the Arizona Republic newspaper, which brought to light some disturbing details from the episode, prompted shocked reactions on social media, and garnered the attention of the national news media. The deaths In June 1963, Wilson was arrested and charged with the murder of his mother, Lavonne Wilson (52), and his sister, Judy Wilson (17), at the family’s home in Hugo, Oklahoma. According to local news reports from the time, as well as Choctaw County court records which we obtained, the 18-year-old Wilson gave shifting accounts of his involvement (although Wilson now denies this). On 23 June 1963, police told the Lawton Constitution newspaper that Wilson (whose legal name was John Robert Wiste) at first claimed he was awakened by an explosion occurring in the early morning hours of 20 June and fled the family home before it went up in flames. He reportedly told police that he returned to the house later that day, found his mother and sister dead, and put them in bed. But according to later news reports, by that time autopsies of his mother and sister had confirmed that they had died before the fire started, and Wilson subsequently led police to the location of a rifle. Two days later, the Lawton Constitution reported that Wilson had confessed to killing both women and then setting fire to the house. (In an email to us, Wilson denied ever confessing to the murders.) The trials After attending his mother’s and sister’s funerals, Wilson was arrested and charged with two counts of murder. His lawyers, Vester Songer and Hal Welch, argued that Wilson had suffered amnesia, could not remember key events from the night of 19-20 June, and therefore was not fit to stand trial or offer a “rational defense.” Choctaw County District Court Judge Howard Phillips ordered that Wilson be admitted to Eastern State Hospital for three months for medical and psychiatric evaluation. In September 1963, Dr. Ruth Annadown, Acting Medical Superintendent at the hospital, wrote to Judge Phillips to say that “It is the opinion of the staff that the patient has a complete amnesia for the allegations.” Having interviewed Wilson, Dr. Walter E. Blevins, Staff Physician at the hospital, relayed the young man’s own description of the night his mother and sister died. It is worth quoting extensively, because it constitutes an account of Wilson’s memories of that night, offered just five weeks afterwards: On interview the patient states that he had gotten along fairly well with his mother until the last two or three years then they began to argue about practically everything, but mostly about the girls he would go with and using the family automobile. The arguments had gotten particularly heated over the past six months. He states that his mother would fly into a rage about the girl he was going with and had told him repeatedly that he would have to quit going with her. On the night that his mother and sister died he states that he had gone to bed and was asleep when his mother came in; she awakened him and started to argue with him about his girl friend and told him that he could not use the family car again. She also told him he would have to leave and proceeded to pack his clothes and put them in the car. He told her he was not going to leave, whereupon she picked up a loaded automatic, .22 rifle at the foot of the patient’s bed and pointed it at him. The patient states that she clicked off the safety on the rifle and he became frightened. He says in his own mind he had to get the rifle because he knew that in her frame of mind she might shoot him. At this point he states that he cannot remember what happened, but when he came to himself his mother and sister were lying on the floor and blood was everywhere. He says that he did not know whether they were dead or not, but that they did not seem to [be] breathing. He says he laid them on the bed and took the gun to the car and thought about running, but decided against this and went back inside the house. He then thought about killing himself, but was afraid someone else might be blamed for it. He then took some gasoline and poured it around in the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom and then struck a match. He states that there was an explosion and he either jumped or was blown through a window on to the ground. He states that the explosion burned his hands and face. A neighbor hearing the explosion came over and took him to the hospital. In an email, Wilson told us that Dr. Blevins was “mistaken” in his report about the interview, saying that “He actually [was] referring to the allegations of law enforcement at the time, which was [sic] proven wrong at the trial.” According to court records and news reports, Wilson’s first prosecution for murder ended in a mistrial in 1965, but the case was set for a retrial in 1966. Wilson and his lawyers maintained that he still suffered from complete amnesia about the crucial events of 20 June 1963, and Dr. Moorman Prosser, a psychiatrist, gave expert testimony to that effect, writing: He still has a very real and complete amnesia for that period of time when his mother and sister were allegedly shot with a gun held by him. It is my studied opinion that this man cannot recall or recount this period and could not possibly assist you in explaining or accounting for his action in this interval of time. In March 1966, Judge Phillips ordered that a jury decide whether Wilson’s amnesia meant he was incapable of mounting a proper defense. The jury sided with Wilson, but the case was not dismissed outright. As the Arizona Republic reported in 2018, the case was “suspended” on the basis that Wilson might someday recover his memories from that night and be in a position to present a proper defense. In December 1973, with the murder charges still pending and Wilson then 29 years old, his lawyers petitioned Choctaw County District Court to dismiss the case, arguing that the seven-year delay had been unreasonable and denied him his constitutional right to a speedy trial: The aforementioned delay, none of which was occasioned by defendant in any respect, has resulted in substantial prejudice to defendant’s right to a speedy trial herein, due to the fact that relevant testimony from witnesses favorable to the defendant is no longer available due to the death of such witnesses, and it now appears and [sic] difficult and unlikely that testimony relevant to defendant’s mental condition at the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the filing of this information will now be available to defendant. The court agreed and dismissed all charges against Wilson. Later life In a 2017 interview with Arizona’s Green Valley News, Wilson averred that he obtained a degree in political science from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1968 and a law degree from Texas Tech University in 1973. Wilson practiced law in Burleson, Texas, before moving to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1995, taking a position as law lecturer in Maricopa County Community Colleges and starting a private investigation firm. He told the Green Valley News that “I didn’t take the Arizona bar. I’d already done the law thing in spades, and I just wanted to move straight into something else completely different.” However, Wilson told us in an email that he tried to take the Arizona bar exam in 2012 but his efforts to practice law there were thwarted by an old controversy. That old controversy was that Wilson had stopped practicing law in the state of Texas under a cloud of misconduct allegations in the early 1990s. He had been convicted of defrauding a client by committing forgery in Johnson County and was suspended from the practice of law in June 1990, but in the ensuing years Wilson persisted in advertising his services as an attorney and billing and collecting legal fees from client, according to the State Bar of Texas. While disciplinary action was pending against Wilson for alleged professional misconduct in July 1994, the Supreme Court of Texas received a letter written by a “Robert J. Wilson” announcing his resignation from the state bar, and the court thereafter ordered that Wilson’s “law license be cancelled and revoked and his name be … dropped and deleted from the list of persons licensed to practice law in the State of Texas.” The resignation letter read (in part): I have been a member [of the bar] since 1973, and I must report that I no longer desire to be a member of an organization that engages (at least in my case) in a policy of persecution, rather than to protect the interests of the general public. Your office’s handling of the case is not something The State Bar should be proud of. I have dismissed my Counter Claim against The State Bar, but since I no longer am a resident of Texas, I may refile the matter in Federal Court. My decision is not yet firm on this. I no longer intend to return to the practice of law, since I’ve decided life is too short to be engaged in continuing litigation with The State Bar of Texas simply because I stood up for my rights which is obviously not the thing to do when dealing with The State Bar of Texas. The Texas Supreme Court revoked and cancelled Wilson’s state law license the following month. Wilson told us in an email that he had never resigned from the bar; that the resignation letter had been sent by “some unknown person” who had forged his signature. Wilson told us that he had written to the State Bar of Texas in 2012 asking to be reinstated so that he could practice law in Arizona, but his requests were denied. As of July 2018, the State Bar of Texas web site lists Wilson as having been “not eligible to practice law in Texas” since August 1994. Recovered memories In 2010, Wilson published his memoirs in book form as Bobby’s Trials, in which he asserted that he had never confessed to killing either his mother or sister, and that corrupt and abusive police had lied to the local press about the case. In the book Wilson gave a detailed account of the events of that fateful night, claiming that early in his legal career (about ten years after the deaths), he visited a crime scene at a gas station in Texas while representing a client, and the odors of blood and gasoline brought back a full, conscious recollection of what had happened in the early morning hours of 20 June 1963. Since then, Wilson has averred he remembers that his sister was killed when his mother, aiming for him, struck her with the butt of a rifle. He has admitted that he shot his mother dead, but he denies setting the house on fire, claiming instead that his mother’s wild shooting caused jars of gasoline stored in his bedroom to smash and spill, and the house subsequently exploded when a light switch shorted. In Bobby’s Trials he described the event in a markedly different fashion than was recorded by Dr. Blevins back in 1963: I had been in a deep sleep that morning, when suddenly I was startled by my mother shaking me violently and shouting, “Get up!” “I don’t have any pants on,” I said. “Get up now!” The barrel of my .22 caliber Mossberg fully loaded semi-automatic was pointed at me. I slid my feet out from under the bed covers, turned my back on my mother, and pulled up my jeans, when she screamed again. “Don’t turn your back on me, you sorry bastard. Think you can leave me for some worthless bitch like your father did? I’ll show you.” I turned around to face the rifle barrel and the crazed look of a woman out of her mind. She was going to shoot me. I had no doubt. I reached up and pulled the ceiling light string, and the only light source in my room was gone. The room was immediately totally black. I fell to the floor and crawled on my hands and knees behind my steel frame bed, trying to hide and looking for cover. Blam blam blam blam blam blam. She started shooting, six times. Muzzle flashes and bullets flew all across my room. Bullets and empty shells struck the walls, the floor, and the steel bed frame of my bed and ricocheted all around. I heard glass breaking and things falling from the walls. A shadow moved through the open door of our adjoining bedrooms, and Mother thought it was me. She was startled, and her shadow swung that Mossberg rifle by its barrel like a baseball bat. There was a sickening thud and moan as a body crashed into the steel headboard of my bed frame and fell to the floor. I had always kept my small single-shot .22 caliber rifle under my bed … I looked over the top of my bed and could see Mother’s shadow under that single ceiling light bulb. She held the rifle in one hand and was trying to find that string with the other hand as she turned in slow circles while trying to turn on that light bulb. I knew I was a dead man if she managed to turn on that light. There was no question in my mind now that she had gone completely crazy and would kill me and anyone else who got in her way. I only had one chance to survive this encounter, and I took it. I raised and pointed the short rifle toward where her head should be, and I fired. She collapsed near my bed without a sound. I pulled myself up with one hand on my bed, reached for that still swinging light string, and pulled it. I was greeted by the most horrible sight a boy could possibly encounter. Lying in a bloody heap on the floor was my mother, on top of my sister. Both were bleeding profusely from head wounds. Both were still breathing heavily and slowly. One of my mother’s eyes was gone; just a bloody eye socket remained. Sister’s long brown hair was heavily matted in blood. Blood was everywhere. Mother still had her work clothes on. Sister was in her pajamas, now soaked in blood. In an email, Wilson told us that “I stand by the wording and information in my book, ‘Bobby’s Trials,’ it is the most accurate description of what occurred.”",0
"""One of the more popular provisions in the Affordable Care Act is the one that prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems. Pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, depression and diabetes are among the most common ailments that can get in the way of being accepted by a new insurance company. The health care law tackled this problem in two steps. Starting with children, as of September 2010, insurers could not deny coverage, charge significantly higher premiums, require an extended waiting period or curtail benefits due to a pre-existing condition. The second step takes place Jan. 1, 2014, when the same protections kick in for adults. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., appearing Aug. 5, 2013, on PoliticsNation on MSNBC, chastised Republicans for wanting to repeal Obamacare, saying many benefits would be lost. """"Half of all adults have a pre-existing condition that will go away in terms of insurance coverage on January 1st,"""" Schakowsky said. """"I mean, what a blessing that is for sick Americans, for people who are walking around uninsured or underinsured."""" We know that Americans face a lot of health challenges, but do half of adults have a pre-existing condition? In the eye of the insurer There are a range of estimates for the number of people with health issues that would put them at risk of running afoul of an insurance company. One reason is that insurers have different lists of conditions that raise a red flag. Similarly, researchers can take a conservative approach and use a short list, or be more expansive with a longer one. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, examined five studies on the prevalence of pre-existing conditions. The lowest estimate counted just eight diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. That study came up with about 36 million people between 19 and 64 who have one of those health issues. Another study used a list of 60 conditions and arrived at a number of 60 million who might be vulnerable to denial of coverage, and the GAO itself used medical survey data and reached a high-end estimate of 122 million. As percentages, this translates into a low-end estimate of 20 percent of American adults potentially at risk, 66 percent on the high end, with a midpoint of 32 percent. An analysis from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services came up with a roughly similar range of 19 percent to 50 percent. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, notes that projections of the scope of the problem can miss the mark. The administration expected about 375,000 people would enroll in a special insurance program for those who had been denied coverage but as of January 2013, only about 107,000 had. That said, many factors apart from health could have affected enrollments. The main caveat with these studies is they estimate the number of people who have a health issue that might lead to denial of coverage by an insurance company. That describes a group of people who are at risk. What’s missing is an estimate of the number of people who actually run into the problem of being denied coverage. A limited analysis emerged from the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2009. Using data from four of the country’s largest private insurers, committee investigators found that the companies had denied coverage to one out of seven people based on pre-existing conditions during a three-year period. The denial rate rose each year, increasing by nearly 50 percent over the three years while at the same time, the number of new applications for coverage only rose by about 16 percent. Survey says Another line of data comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation and its monthly tracking polls. In June 2013, Kaiser reported that 49 percent of adults said that they or a family member has heart disease, diabetes, cancer or another condition that generally triggers an issue with insurance companies. Within that group, about a fourth of them reported that coverage had been denied or higher premiums had been charged due to a pre-existing condition. This is far from a perfect fit with the other studies. To say someone in your family has a health condition is essentially reporting at the household level, while the GAO and other studies were estimating the number of individuals. And if we do the math, it seems like about an eighth, or 12 percent of the households had actually run into a problem with a health insurance company. The Kaiser survey does affirm that the problem is substantive and relatively widespread, although not necessarily as broad as the higher estimates in the studies. Our ruling Schakowsky said that half of all adults suffer from a pre-existing condition. Studies reflect a range of estimates and Schakowsky’s figure falls at the high end. A government analysis points to a mid-range estimate of 32 percent, a significant fraction of the adult population.""",0
"On 5 December 2017, the UK tabloid Metro attempted to revive discussion of an enigmatic and poorly understood disease linked to heavy long-term cannabis consumption by pushing the word “scromit” — a portmanteau of “scream” and “vomit” — onto an unsuspecting public: Doctors said users have been taken to hospital after suffering extreme bouts of ‘scromiting’ – which means they are screaming and vomiting at the same time. This new word was invented by staff at emergency rooms across the US, who are seeing more and more people turn up yelling in pain and throwing up all over the place. Its [sic] believed the scromiting is caused by a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) which affects people who have consumed weed for a long period of time. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (called CHS for short) is, indeed, a real condition. It was first described in a 2004 case report of 19 patients in Australia. A 2016 report described the progression of the illness this way: Classically, CHS progresses into three distinct phases: prodromal [early symptoms], hyperemetic [severe vomiting] , and recovery. During the prodromal phase, the patient develops early morning nausea, a fear of vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Afterward, the hyperemetic phase consists of incapacitating nausea and profuse vomiting. Most patients complain of mild abdominal pain and weight loss. Patients are relieved by taking hot showers. The recovery stage begins with cessation of cannabis use. The majority of patients will develop this symptom within 1-5 years after the beginning of consumption. Among the most pressing mysteries about the condition are what causes some heavy marijuana users to develop it when many other heavy users do not. A 2011 review of the literature has concluded: …the mechanism by which cannabis induced hyperemesis is presently unknown. Similarly unknown is the reason why the excessive vomiting phase of the syndrome is alleviated by a hot bath or shower, even though this, enigmatically, appears to be the most effective short-term treatment of the condition: The most effective treatment during the hyperemetic phase of CHS is the use of hot showers by patients. The effects of this learned behavior are temperature-dependent, fast acting, but short-lived. Hot showers improve symptoms of nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite during the hyperemetic phase. The precise mechanism by which hot bathing produces a rapid reduction in the symptoms of CHS is unknown. Another question is the degree to which increasingly legal marijuana has played a role in increased diagnosis of the disease. While diagnoses have been rising, it is hard to develop a conclusive understanding of a disease only recently defined in the medical literature. One 2015 study attempted to address this by comparing pre-legalization cases of cyclical vomiting in Colorado emergency rooms to post-legalization cases, seeing a marked increase post legalization, but their numbers were limited by a lack of specific information on each patient’s drug use: The prevalence of cyclic vomiting presentations nearly doubled after the liberalization of medical marijuana. Patients presenting with cyclic vomiting in the postliberalization period were more likely to endorse marijuana use, although it is unclear whether this was secondary to increased marijuana use, more accurate marijuana reporting, or both. The final claim made by Metro concerns the use and origin of the word “scromiting,” which they claim was invented by staff at emergency rooms across the United States, “who are seeing more and more people turn up yelling in pain and throwing up all over the place.” Outside of this unsourced statement and its reappearance in articles referencing the original Metro report, we can find no evidence of this term’s widespread and specific use as it concerns any cannabis-related ailment. Based on the term’s inclusion in the internet-slang database Urban Dictionary since at least 2008, its use likely pre-dates emergency room CHS cases. However, the condition, its symptoms, and its occurrence, as described by Metro and other outlets, is accurate. As such, we rank the claim that “people are ‘scromiting’ after smoking too much cannabis” as mostly true, though the condition itself is rare. Finally, this syndrome is reasonably self-limiting, as CHS is generally resolved fairly simply: through cessation of cannabis consumption.",0
"Girl Scout cookies don’t fund Planned Parenthood. Also, contrary to many allegations, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), the national organization, doesn’t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Some regional Girl Scout councils have, however, partnered with Planned Parenthood to provide sex education in the past. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a Texas-based pro-life organization. The group became angry when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with a Planned Parenthood office in Waco. The confrontation led to a showdown between leaders of Pro-Life Waco and then-Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Kathy Clonginger on the “Today” show in March 2004. In a transcript of the exchange, Clogninger defended the council’s decision: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that’s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls. …It’s really impossible for girls to grow up in today’s society with out having access to good information. We will continue to partner with organizations across this nation, and local community Girl Scouts will make decisions based on their local community partnerships and the needs of their girls and their families. Clonginger didn’t acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there’s no evidence that there ever was one. GSUSA says that the national chapter “does not take a position to develop materials” or programs regarding human sexuality, birth control or abortion. Rather, those decisions are made at the local level by parents, volunteers and council members: Parents or guardians make all decisions regarding program participation that may be of a sensitive nature. Consistent with that belief, GSUSA directs councils, including volunteer leaders, to get written parental permission for any locally planned program that could be considered sensitive. In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video: We do not now, nor have we ever, had a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts of the USA believes that reproductive issues are deeply private matters, best left to families. I find it unsettling that anyone would use the Girl Scout brand to have very adult conversations. A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement; it’s an investment in a little girl… Given Clonginger’s earlier remarks, Chavez’s statement has caused some confusion. The simple explanation is that Clonginger acknowledge local “relationships” between councils and Planned Parenthood while Chavez denied a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. There’s also been some confusion about where money from Girl Scout cookie sales go. A sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils. GSUSA doesn’t get a cut of the revenue, but it does get licensing royalties from bakers of the cookies: Girl Scout troops and groups must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and group travel. Girl Scouts may not earn proceeds as individuals; however, Girl Scout councils offer a wide variety of recognition items, program- and store-related credits, and travel experiences that girls are eligible to earn individually based on their sales. All troop proceeds and other rewards earned through participation in the Girl Scout Cookie Program must be used to enhance each girl’s Girl Scout experience. Each Girl Scout council releases an annual report each year. The only way to know how your local council spends those dollars is to review its annual report, or to ask a local staff member.

"In November 2017, unreliable web sites spread a fabricated story about a so-called “new outbreak” of human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to genital warts and various cancers. The Native Love web site wrote: Students from Kisii University, Kenya and the general public at large have been warned against kissing carelessly due to an outbreak of Human papilloma virus, which has seen several people admitted at Kisii level 5 hospital after testing positive to the disease. The HPV is gradually circulating Kenya and gradually making its way into the Southern parts of Africa and will soon hit Africa at large. Africans are believed to travel a lot to all parts of the world. So if proper awareness is not created, this is likely to hit the whole world in no distance time. You are hereby advised to warn and inform family members, friends, well wishers and colleagues about this deadly disease that kills faster than HIV/AIDS. The same article was published by Discover Newz and The Daily Berries. It also had a previous iteration in a March 2017 story published by HIN News South Africa. The earliest version of the story that we found dates from May 2016, and was published by Trending In Kenya, a web site that is registered in Nairobi and posts fake articles alleging devil worship and alien creatures, and sensationalist celebrity gossip. Mzansi Live, which is listed by the fact-checking agency Africa Check as a known fake news web site in South Africa, also published the story, but notably switched the location of the university in question from Kenya to Johannesburg. There is no truth to the story, which is not corroborated by any reporting in reliable local news media. The World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa has made no reference to any particular “outbreak” of HPV in recent years. HPV is a collection of strains of viral infection, transmitted by skin and mucous membrane contact (rather than the exchange of bodily fluids) during a variety of sexual activities. It is the world’s most common sexually transmitted infection, but in most cases does not come with harmful symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Which is why an HPV infection can go undetected for decades. Certain strains of HPV can lead to genital warts and various types of cancer, including cervical and oral cancer. If a case of HPV does result in a cancerous tumor, it often takes years and even decades  to develop, according to the National Cancer Institute. So the fake articles present an implausible and misleading picture of free-kissing college students suddenly falling deathly ill and being admitted to hospital due to an outbreak of HPV. That is simply not how HPV spreads, and it is not an accurate depiction of its repercussions. According to Nechama Brodie, who runs the research and training division of Africa Check, fabricated health scares such as this one are universal, but also occur within a very specific context. “This plays into a well-established trope of poorly-informed myths around healthcare in Africa,” Brodie told us by phone from South Africa. The juxtaposition of HPV and HIV is no accident. “It’s confusing HPV with HIV, and HIV is still a big ‘scare factor,'” Brodie adds. HIV/AIDS looms large in this article, a long shadow cast by the damage it has inflicted in Africa (particularly Southern Africa). The fundamental message conveyed by the story is “this is worse than AIDS,” Brodie says, adding there are rumors HIV “doesn’t exist, [or] HIV was invented by white colonialists, [or] it was introduced to control the black population,” among others. In addition to this strain of misinformation, there are false claims about what causes HIV to spread, and how it could be cured. The apex of this, according to Brodie, came during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki in South Africa during the early 2000’s. Mbeki indulged in “HIV/AIDS denialism,” supported theories that herbal remedies and vitamins could cure AIDS and — most damagingly — refused to approve the provision of cheap antiretroviral drugs.",1
"The $115 million campaign by the Food and Drug Administration will target the 10 million people aged 12 to 17 who are open to trying cigarettes or who are already experimenting with them and are in danger of becoming regular smokers, the FDA said. The campaign is the first of several scheduled to be launched over the next two years that will target at risk, rural, gay, African American, and American Indian youth. The goal of the campaigns is to reduce the number of youth cigarette smokers by at least 300,000 within three years, the FDA said. The first, called “The Real Cost” campaign, will launch on February 11 and targets marginalized youngsters who may be starting to turn to tobacco as a way of coping with poor or stressful lives, Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA’s tobacco products division, said at a media briefing on Monday. The ads will appear in print and on TV and radio as well as on billboards and at bus stops, addressing typical teenage issues such as concerns with appearance and the desire to strike out and become independent. One series of ads features a bully who demands money. A print ad shows a small, greasy-haired bully standing inside a school locker yelling, “Outside Now, Punk.” The tag line says: “You wouldn’t take it from a tiny bully, but when you’re hooked on tobacco, you’re taking it from a cigarette.”  Another series of ads focuses on the cosmetic damage cigarettes can cause, especially to the skin and teeth. In one TV ad a young girl goes into a convenience store to buy a packet of cigarettes. She hands over the money but the clerk says “it’s not enough.” The girl reaches up and peels a large piece of skin off her face and slides it across the counter. In a similar ad a young man asks for a packet of menthol cigarettes. When told by the clerk that the money is not enough he takes a wrench, pulls out one of his teeth, and hands that over too. The ads, which were created by the advertising agency DraftFCB, a unit of Interpublic Group have been rigorously tested with the target audience, Zeller said, adding that he is “very optimistic” they will achieve the desired results of turning some kids away from smoking. To judge whether campaign is successful, the FDA plans to monitor 8,000 young people over two years to measure changes in attitudes toward tobacco and on behavior before and after the campaign’s launch. Each day, more than 3,200 people under the age of 18 try their first cigarette and more than 700 become daily smokers, the FDA said. Ninety percent of adult smokers start smoking before the age of 18, “which is why early intervention is so critical,” FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said at the briefing. The campaigns are expected to cost $400 million altogether. They are being funded with fees paid to the FDA by the tobacco industry under a 2009 law that gives the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and roll your own tobacco. The agency is expected shortly to extend its regulatory authority to electronic cigarettes and cigars. The proposed regulations are currently being reviewed by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.",0
"While it might be premature to speculate about the exact costs of an experimental vaccine, offering no discussion at all is a major flaw in this story. Cost is a central, vital part to this narrative because any health technology developed to be used in the world’s poorest countries are only going to matter to those people if it is affordable. The APPROACH trial randomly assigned 393 volunteers from five countries to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. While the report notes that “the mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots,” one is tempted to ask: Compared to what? How is it possible to determine the benefits of the vaccine when we don’t have any quantitative sense of how the vaccine/ comparators performed? That being said, the story makes it clear that these immune response results, interesting though they may be, are not the outcome that matters — and this is a very important qualifier. It also uses results from previous animal studies to suggest how the vaccine might ultimately perform in people. It does this in a way that isn’t inappropriately optimistic. We’re on the fence with this rating but will give the benefit of the doubt. The story says the Ad26 vaccine was the “best tolerated” of several approaches, but doesn’t tell us what may have occurred in people who didn’t tolerate it so well. The potential indirect harms of a vaccine program could also have been mentioned. The vaccine is expected to work only about 50 to 60 percent of the time, according to the researchers. If people feel less pressure to employ other proven measures to control HIV (condoms, etc) because of the vaccine, then it’s possible some harm could occur due to false reassurance. The story gets good marks for not exaggerating what we should conclude from the available research, i.e. :  “we still don’t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don’t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.” There is no disease mongering here. Barouch, the lead investigator, is only identified with the vaccine center but his previous disclosures show he has licensed patents to Crucell Holland, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, which is funding the current research. The extent of his financial involvement with them should’ve been made more clear. The article mentions many of the other important public health measures to control HIV (education, public awareness campaigns, condom use, etc) and other vaccines in trials. The story makes it clear the vaccine is still in development and not likely to be available any time soon. What is “novel” here is the type of vaccine under development, since it attempts to encompass the diversity in HIV found around the globe. The story fairly establishes the vaccine’s novel approach. There is little evidence of an overreliance on a news release, especially with the use of many caveats warning that this research shouldn’t be overinterpreted and the use of at least one outside source.",0
"""As the Democratic race has tightened, the Hillary Clinton campaign has portrayed Sen. Barack Obama as inconsistent on abortion rights. """"In the Illinois state Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted 'present,' instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a women's right to choose,"""" Sen. Clinton said in a December 2007 speech in Iowa. In the days leading up to Super Tuesday on Feb. 5, 2008, several other groups repeated the charge against Obama via e-mails. The facts here are not in dispute. Obama did vote present on seven bills that attempted to restrict abortion. His defenders argue that it was a tactic to disrupt legislation that would be used against Democrats in swing districts. It's worth pausing here to explain what the """"present"""" vote means. The Illinois Legislature allows members to vote """"yes,"""" """"no,"""" or """"present."""" Bills need """"yes"""" votes to pass, so a vote of """"present"""" counts the same as a """"no."""" Thus, Obama's """"present"""" votes on bills seeking to restrict abortion counted the same as if he had voted """"no."""" All of the bills passed by in the Senate by sizable margins. The seven votes were on proposals that abortion opponents have successfully passed in other places. Two bills outlawed the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Two bills required parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Three bills were for so-called """"born alive"""" legislation, which require doctors to administer medical care to aborted fetuses that survive the abortion process in hopes that the fetuses can survive. No one questions that Obama opposed the seven pieces of legislation; indeed, he is mentioned in news reports from the time as being against several of the measures. Rather, Obama's critics say he ducked a """"no"""" vote; supporters say it was a tactical move. Those interpretations seem to have split the leaders of the Illinois abortion rights movement. Obama should have voted """"no"""" on those bills, said Bonnie Grabenhofer, president of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Clinton. """"We think the way you talk about a bill and the way you stand up is important,"""" she said. """"It was a strategy that allowed people to take political cover as opposed to talking about why the bill was a bad bill and clearly saying no."""" But Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said Obama was helping advance a prochoice agenda by voting present. """"He always was going to vote 'no' on these bills. We needed to keep some of our moderate Democrats from voting yes, which is something you never want to happen,"""" Sutherland said. By having a well-known supporter of abortion rights also vote present, it gave other Democrats cover, she said. Regardless of the interpretation of the """"present"""" votes, Obama has received extremely positive ratings from organizations that promote abortion rights. Even Grabenhofer's organization, the NOW Illinois political action committee, endorsed Obama twice after the """"present"""" votes. The group did not endorse in the U.S. Senate race in 2004, she said, in part because of the present votes. Steve Trombley of Planned Parenthood in Chicago has defended Obama's prochoice bona fides, even though Planned Parenthood has not endorsed in the race. """"Barack Obama has always been committed to a woman's right to choose. He has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record both in the U.S. Senate and the Illinois Senate,"""" Trombley wrote in a statement posted on the Obama campaign Web site. """"I don't know why Illinois NOW has changed its opinion of Barack Obama since his record has remained the same and since his time as a state senator, he has only demonstrated a full and steady commitment to choice,"""" Trombley added. Both Clinton and Obama have their supporters among the abortion rights movement. Clinton arguably has the bigger endorsements. She has been endorsed by the National Organization for Women and EMILY's List, an organization dedicated to electing prochoice women. Obama has some high-profile endorsements as well, such as Kate Michelman, former president, NARAL Prochoice America, who sided with Obama after John Edwards dropped out of the race. Obama also has the support of U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the first executive director of EMILY's List, who has publicly defended Obama as a strong supporter of abortion rights. We checked her statement  here  and found it to be . Two other large groups, NARAL Prochoice America and Planned Parenthood, are not endorsing. Planned Parenthood, however, has given both candidates 100 percent ratings for their records on abortion. We stipulate that there are clearly different interpretations of the significance of Obama's """"present"""" votes. But there's no doubt he made them. So we find Clinton's statement to be .""",0
"Rumors holding that Hillary Clinton had a “meltdown,” threw a water glass at a staffer, and engaged in a curse-filled tirade following NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum with host Matt Lauer have been circulating since the Democratic presidential nominee participated in that forum, which aired on 7 September 2016. While these rumors did seem to be rooted in a little truth — the Clinton campaign was not happy with the questions Lauer asked (or didn’t ask) during the event — claims that Clinton threw a “hissy fit” over it were unfounded. The website Victurus Libertas was the first to promulgate this rumor, publishing an article headlined “Temper! Temper! Hillary Goes on Rampage for Over An Hour — Throwing Glass at Staffer’s Head.” Although Victurus Libertas linked to credible reports from NY Mag  and Yahoo! News detailing that Clinton’s campaign was miffed with Lauer for not fact-checking Republican candidate Donald Trump during the event, they cited Politico as their source for the claim that Clinton had thrown a water glass at a staffer: And Politico‘s headlines read:  “Liberals Lash Out at Lauer, NBC“. It seems to me, no one is “lashing out” but Hillary. Hillary’s meltdown included throwing a water glass at a staffer — narrowly missing her head, and demanding Matt Lauer be fired! She was overheard threatening executives at NBC saying “If I lose, we all go down and that Fascist Fuck will have us swinging from nooses! What the fuck is wrong with you idiots?” None of this information appeared in the cited Politico report, however. Politico published an article headlined “Liberals Lash Out at Lauer, NBC,” reporting that Clinton’s campaign and supporters were upset with interviewer Lauer for posing “unbalanced questions”: At an event that saw both Clinton and conservative challenger Donald Trump challenged on their stances toward national defense and foreign policy, liberal operatives and Clinton supporters took exception to what they perceived as unbalanced questions, criticizing Lauer for failing to push back on false statements by Trump and for spending a significant amount of time on Clinton’s email scandal. But Politico did not report that Hillary Clinton threw a water glass at anyone’s head, threatened the firing of Matt Lauer, or called Donald Trump a “fascist fuck.” All of that was invented by Victurus Libertas in an apparent attempt to smear the Democratic candidate, and it served as the basis for a longer, highly embellished version of the rumor that began circulating via e-mail in October 2016: Subject: Matt Lauer & Hillary what REALLY happened…. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AT THE NBC PRESIDENTIAL FORUM WITH MATT LAUER? DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON’S BEHIND THE SCENES TIRADE AFTER NBC’s MATT LAUER ASKED CLINTON ONE QUESTION SHE HAD NOT PRE-APPROVED. VETERAN NBC CAMERAMAN: ‘YOU REALLY HAD TO SEE THIS TO BELIEVE IT … SHE CAME APART – LITERALLY UNGLUED; SHE IS THE MOST FOUL-MOUTHED WOMAN I’VE EVER HEARD … AND THAT VOICE AT SCREECH LEVEL … AWFUL!’ “SHE LOOKED SO ENRAGED THAT WE ALL THOUGHT HER HEAD WOULD EXPLODE … IT WAS A FULL-ON MELT-DOWN, AND THEN SHE SCREAMED SHE’D GET THAT F–––ING LAUER FIRED FOR THIS. IT WENT ON FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR; WE ALL THOUGHT THE EMS WOULD BE THE NEXT CALL.”  NBC Associate Producer of Forum: Behind the scenes, NBC technicians and cameramen at the Wednesday night, Commander-in-Chief Forum (Sept 7) report that Hillary Clinton was so angry and incensed that she had been ‘blind-sided’ by one question she was not prepared for and had not approved in advance. “When her time in front of the cameras ended, Clinton shook the hand Lauer extended to her and smiled once more for the wide camera shot and then Hillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and threw it at the face of her assistant and the screaming started. She was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her — she went kind of manic and didn’t have any control over herself at that point. How these people work with this woman is amazing to me. Most of the small military audience were cordoned off, their seating not close to Mrs. Clinton, but certainly they heard her screaming because it was loud … and she really didn’t seem to care who heard any of it.” Republican Donald Trump also appeared, in a separate telecast from Hillary Clinton’s and arrived with his two sons but no entourage or assistants in tow. The NBC cameramen involved in his segment said he was a ‘true gentleman’ and Trump and his sons spoke to everyone and thanked them for inviting him to speak: “It was a pleasure to answer your questions Matt.” Hillary Clinton’s segment was much different. According to people working on the sidelines, “When Matt posed the one legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails, we could see she was beginning to boil and her eyes looked to pop.” “It was toward the end of her interview so she was becoming unglued by the time Lauer finished with questioning. Hillary went ballistic, throwing a huge tantrum and screaming at her staff, “you f–––ing idiots, you were supposed to have this thing set up for me and you’ve screwed it up! If that fucking bastard wins we all hang from nooses! Lauer’s finished … and if I lose it’s all on you ass—-s for screwing this up.” Clinton finally stormed off the military ‘set’ and the assistant producer said she was screaming that she wanted to talk to “the idiot who set this mess up … you do not blindside me – ever!” and continued to demand to speak with executives at Comcast, parent company to NBC Universal. Her dozen or more aides were visibly disturbed and tried to calm her down when she started shaking uncontrollably. That did not stop her from demanding an executive “on the phone, now!” She was told the executive-in-charge of the forum was ready to talk with her and she was led away by two rather large aides who appeared to help her walk. The TV executives got the message with all of the censuring headlines that followed over the next couple of days when it seemed the entire media turned on Matt Lauer for behaving in a “partisan” manner and “being grossly unfair and critical of the former secretary of state.” Matt Lauer was heavily criticized on air by the Clinton campaign the rest of the week with most of the mainstream media joining in. The media appeared to frame Matt’s one serious question as the Clinton campaign was doing…”an unfair and partisan attack on Mrs. Clinton.” Matt Lauer is still facing major backlash following his 23 minutes with Hillary Clinton. Privately, many reporters said Matt handed the Democrat nominee the expected softball questions, but made the decision to ask about the emails because, “the American people deserve an answer from the former secretary of state.” Calls were made to New York Times, Washington Post and Huffington Post and Twitter executives with orders to “Crush Matt Lauer”. As you can easily see with all the headlines from these MSM sources, they did as they were told by the Clinton campaign. Hillary also screamed that she would be “treated with respect at the debates or heads will roll.” Staffers at the Clinton campaign report that they fear her wrath and uncontrollable outbursts, and one described Hillary as “an egotistical psychopath”. Since Hillary does not allow any staff to have cell phones when she is in their presence, no footage is available, but Hillary will never let this rest. She has made it clear that she wants Matt Lauer to be “persona non grata – for putting her on the spot.” Interim DNC chairman Donna Brazile, the first black woman to hold the position, was singled out by Hillary during the rant. She screamed at Donna, “I’m so sick of your face. You stare at the wall like a brain dead buffalo, while letting that f–––ing Lauer get away with this. What are you good for, really? Get the f––– to work janitoring this mess — do I make myself clear?” A female NBC executive said that Donna Brazile looked at Mrs. Clinton and never flinched, which seemed to enrage Hillary all the more. The executive continued, “It was the most awful and terrible…and racist display — such a profane meltdown I have ever witnessed from anyone, and I will never forget it. That woman should never see the inside of the oval office I can tell you that. She was unhinged and just continued to verbally abuse everyone — she was out of control.” The earliest iteration of that longer narrative we could uncover was posted to the message board of the web site MTStars, where it was presented without citations, source information, audio, video, or any other documentation that the described these events actually transpired. It should also be noted that no credible news outlets reported that Clinton went on a cursed-filled tirade after the Commander-in-Chief Forum, or that she threw a water glass at a staffer’s head.",1
"It also said eight of the 520 crew on the Balmoral, operated by Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, had also fallen ill with the bug, identified as a norovirus. The Balmoral left Southampton, England on April 16 for a 34-day cruise, making stops in Portugal and Bermuda before putting in at Norfolk, Virginia, where it first arrived in the United States late last month. CDC officials said at that time that 153 passengers and six crew had been infected by norovirus. Health officials and an epidemiologist boarded the ship at its next stop in Baltimore, Maryland to assess the outbreak and the response. The CDC said specimens collected and onboard tested positive for norovirus, and would be sent to CDC for additional testing. Fred. Olsen said in an April 29 statement that a “gastro-enteritis type illness” had affected a number of guests, with seven cases in isolation at that point. It said two U.S. nationals were on board, with the majority of passengers from the United Kingdom. When the Balmoral docked at Portland, Maine, over the weekend, media reported witnesses seeing surfaces being constantly wiped down. The ship was due to stop at St. John,  New Brunswick, Canada, on Monday. CDC said the cruise line had taken actions in response to the outbreak, including increasing cleaning and disinfection procedures, collecting stool specimens, daily reporting of  illness and dispatching public health and sanitation managers   to oversee and assist with implementation of sanitation and outbreak response. Balmoral has capacity for 1,350 passengers, and is the largest and newest ship in the cruise line’s fleet.",0
"Cost range estimates for statins are given in the story. Story explains that those with fatal cancers were 63% less likely to have ever taken a statin, but then goes on to explain that “it’s also possible that statins don’t prevent certain cancers at all.” Good job briefly mentioning statin side effects of muscle pain, nausea, gas, and liver dysfunction. The story is very clear about the potential holes in the study results and what it would take to actually prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer. No disease mongering here. Ends with “Researchers agreed that until there’s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn’t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.” Important perspective added by independent expert from Duke who was not involved in the study. Final line of the story quotes an independent expert saying “that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.” The story states that about one-quarter of adults age 45 and older in the U.S. take statins to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks. No inordinate claims of novelty were made. It’s clear that the story did not rely on a news release.",0
"""The Gun Owners of America has recently taken aim at an unlikely subject: health care reform. In the last few weeks, GOA has sent out several action alerts to members criticizing the health care reform bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last week. The bill, authored by Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., was supported by all of the committee's Democrats, as well as Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. It will now be merged with another Senate health care bill and go to the full Senate. On Oct. 9, 2009, the day before the Finance Committee began voting on amendments to the Baucus bill, GOA sent an alert to members titled, """"ObamaCare Could be Used to Ban Guns in Home Self-Defense."""" The conservative group speculated about the impact of the health care bill on gun owners, hypothesizing that, in a bid to control spiraling health care costs, the administration will target people who have """"excessively dangerous"""" behaviors that officials believe raise the cost of health care. The group warned that gun ownership — particularly keeping """"a loaded firearm for self-defense"""" — is likely to be high on that list. The memo accuses Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius — who would have significant influence over any new health care policy — of having a """"well-established antipathy to the Second Amendment"""" because she vetoed concealed-carry gun legislation when she was governor of Kansas. The Obama administration is so antigun, the group contends, that """"it is even possible that the Obama-prescribed policy could preclude reimbursement of any kind in a household which keeps a loaded firearm for self-defense."""" In this item, we'll scrutinize the claim that the Baucus bill """"could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."""" To start, we turn to the committee-passed version of the legislation itself. The sweeping health care bill would leave in place the current private insurance system in which most people get coverage from their employer. But the bill would set federal rules for the individual market — that is, for policies purchased by people who are self-employed or have lost their coverage. President Barack Obama and other Democrats have often said the new rules are needed because companies that sell policies on the individual market are often able to impose restrictions about pre-existing conditions and put limitations on coverage. The rules for the individual market would also apply to the """"small group"""" market, which serves smaller employers and their workers. We looked carefully at the language in the Baucus bill and found no mention of either """"gun"""" or """"firearm."""" So there's no explicit support in the bill for the group's claim. Okay, says GOA, but guns could still be a target because of the emphasis on discouraging unhealthy behaviors. """"The ObamaCare bill already contains language that will punish Americans who engage in unhealthy behavior by allowing insurers to charge them higher insurance premiums,"""" the group said in its alert. The group is right that the bill does allow higher premiums based on behavior — specifically, the use of tobacco. The Baucus bill would allow insurers to alter premiums based on tobacco use, age, family composition and cost differences in different geographical regions. The bill establishes a series of ratios for how much these factors can be used to adjust premiums upward. Tobacco users, for instance, could be charged 1.5 times the standard rate under the bill. (There is no such provision in the House bill.) Another provision could provide a loophole that allows behavioral factors to play a wider role in setting premiums. The bill would expand some rules now in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, that allow employees to be rewarded if they participate in wellness programs. Taking part in a wellness program — such as tobacco cessation or a gym membership — can mean lower premiums or co-pays. The bill would increase the size of discounts that can be offered to beneficiaries who enroll in these programs. Some advocacy groups and labor unions have warned this could be a sneaky way of excluding less-healthy workers. And Mike Hammond, GOA's legislative counsel, said that such policies indicate that the bill """"is going in a behavioral direction."""" So, GOA has a point that the Baucus bill opens the door to rating health insurance premiums based on behaviors. But the group is making a huge leap to suggest that could mean the government would target gun owners. In the alert, GOA leaves out two important pieces of context. —  People with """"unhealthy behaviors"""" would actually get stronger protections under the Baucus bill  . Currently, states oversee the individual insurance market with a patchwork of rules. According to the Senate Finance Committee, only one state fully bars premiums from being adjusted for any reasons. Seven states allow limited adjustments for reasons such as age, while 11 allow premiums to vary based on health factors. The remaining 31 — a majority of all states — have not passed any laws restricting what factors insurers can use in setting rates. Under Baucus's bill, the federal rules would take over and put restrictions on when insurers could charge higher premiums as we explain above. This means that for most states, gun owners — or people with other behaviors that the government might theoretically deem """"unhealthy"""" — would actually get more explicit protection under the Baucus bill than they have now. Today, laws in most states would not keep an insurer from discriminating against gun owners in setting premiums; under the Baucus bill, gun owners would have this protection enshrined in law. —  There's no indication in the bill that gun ownership is contemplated as a future factor in premium-setting  . Even if you assume that health care reform is rushing headlong into a new era in which behavior defines health premiums — which is just speculation at this point — there is nothing in the Baucus bill that says, or even suggests, that gun ownership would be cited as a behavioral factor. Every behavioral factor explicitly cited in the bill concerns pure medical issues, such as a lowered cholesterol level, maintainance of a certain body mass index, quitting smoking or losing a specified amount of weight. GOA's Hammond argues that in his experience, bills that start narrowly have a tendency to expand their reach. """"So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that what can be done will be done,"""" he said. But we find insufficient evidence to support the group's overheated rhetoric. Ultimately, we find that while the GOA is right that a more behavioral approach to pricing health care seems to be gaining steam, it is a giant and overly speculative leap to say that the Baucus bill """"could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."""" There is nothing in the bill itself to indicate that is contemplated. We find the statement .""",1
"""When President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change on June 25, 2013, he reached back more than three decades for a personal anecdote to support his argument. """"Now, what you'll hear from the special interests and their allies in Congress is that (my climate change plan) will kill jobs and crush the economy and basically end American free-enterprise as we know it,"""" Obama said. """"And the reason I know you'll hear those things is because that's what they said every time America sets clear rules and better standards for our air and our water and our children's health. """"And every time they've been wrong,"""" Obama continued. """"when I was going to school in 1979, 1980 in Los Angeles, there were days where folks couldn't go outside -- and the sunsets were spectacular -- because of all the pollution in the air. """"At the time when we passed the Clean Air Act, to try to get rid of some of this smog, some of the same doomsayers were saying, ‘New pollution standards will decimate the auto industry.’ Guess what? It didn't happen. Our air got cleaner."""" Many Twitter users asked us whether it was really true that during Obama’s days in Los Angeles """"there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air."""" We’ll start with some background on smog. The smog predominant in Los Angeles -- formally known as """"photochemical smog"""" -- is created when light reacts with motor vehicle and industrial emissions to form ground-level ozone. This ozone can make it difficult to breathe, causing asthma attacks and lung inflammation, as well as making eyes itchy and watery. In the United States, at least, Los Angeles has been ground zero for smog for decades, due to its heavy automobile usage, its industrial base and the presence of mountains and valleys, which prevent polluted air from floating elsewhere. Los Angeles smog emerged in the 1940s and worsened from the 1950s to the 1970s. It got so bad in October 1954 that the city virtually shut down for the entire month (and gas masks were common, as the photograph below illustrates). Smog became so closely identified with Los Angeles that """"smog in a can"""" became a popular gag gift. Today, Los Angeles still has smog -- in April 2013, the American Lung Association ranked L.A. first in the nation for ozone pollution, as well as fourth for particulate pollution such as dust and soot. But concerted environmental efforts have reduced the extent of the problem significantly. In rising order of seriousness, smog alerts for southern California start with health advisories and move upwards to stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3. The last stage 3 smog alert came in 1974 -- so long ago that Ronald Reagan was still governor. The last stage 2 alert came in 1988, and there has been only one stage 1 alert since 1998 (it came in 2003). """"Peak ozone levels in southern California today are roughly one-third of what they were in the late 1970s, due to aggressive and innovative air pollution controls here,"""" said Sam Atwood, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the air-pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange County and portions of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. So what would Obama have experienced when he was a student at Occidental, the college he attended before transferring to Columbia University for his junior and senior year? We can approximate the impact based on statistical and anecdotal evidence. Occidental, located in the Eagle Rock neighborhood northeast of downtown L.A., would have been subject to many of the smog risks typical of the region from 1979 to 1981. According to South Coast Air Quality Management District data, a health advisory -- a comparatively low-level alert -- was issued somewhere in the agency’s region of jurisdiction 169 times in 1979, 152 times in 1980 and 159 times in 1981. The stage 1 threshold was met 120, 101, and 99 times during those three years. Even allowing that Occidental itself may have experienced just a fraction of these episodes, the university still would have faced a significant number. So what did these advisories mean in a practical sense? For a health advisory, the lowest of these levels, all children are supposed to """"discontinue prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise lasting longer than one hour,"""" and """"susceptible persons, such as those with heart or lung disease"""" should """"avoid outdoor activity,"""" including """"calisthenics, basketball, running, soccer, football, tennis, swimming laps, and water polo."""" For the more severe stage 1 episodes, all children are supposed to """"discontinue all vigorous outdoor activities regardless of duration,"""" including """"physical education classes, sports practices, and athletic competitions."""" Finally, for stage 2 or stage 3, all children are supposed to """"discontinue all outdoor activities."""" This suggests that Obama’s claim is slightly exaggerated. He said that """"there were days where folks couldn't go outside,"""" but nothing in the rules addressed what healthy adults could do, including healthy college-age kids. Rather, the rules addressed adults with compromised health as well as children. Still, the reality of smog alerts was not pretty, and by all accounts, staying inside, if feasible, was certainly preferable. The White House pointed us to a Newsweek article from Sept. 24, 1979, when Obama was just settling in at Occidental, that documents what it called the worst L.A. smog in 24 years. """"Tennis courts stood empty,"""" the article said. """"Golf courses lay nearly deserted. Schools canceled recess, and the usual parade of joggers around Pasadena's Rose Bowl dwindled to just a handful."""" We found other first-hand testimony. Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College in the Los Angeles suburb of Claremont, recalls enduring smog alerts when he was a student at neighboring Pitzer College in the mid 1970s. """"There were way too many days when you could not see the mountain that today frames my office window,"""" he said. """"It was possible to not know it was there for months at a time."""" And William Kelly, the co-author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles, recalls attending Occidental a few years before Obama. """"When I got there in 1973, I played a vigorous game of basketball in an un-air-conditioned gym,"""" Kelly said. """"I don't remember the end of the game, just waking up in the early evening with a pounding headache and watering eyes and wheezing in my dorm room. Turns out there was a stage 2 smog alert going on that afternoon, and I didn't have a clue."""" Our ruling Obama said that as a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981, """"there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air."""" The idea that """"folks couldn’t go outside"""" is an oversimplification. The advisories -- and they were only advisories -- were aimed at children and people who had existing health concerns. But Obama is right that smog was a severe problem at the time in the Los Angeles region.""",0
"No cost estimates are provided. But cost is a big deal with this drug. According to a November 2016 story by The Verge, erenumab could cost $8,000-$20,000 a year — or about $667-$1,667 per monthly injection. We understand that this story originated in the UK, where perhaps there’s a different journalistic attitude about the importance of citing costs because the UK has a National Health Service, unlike the US. But this story appeared in the US edition of the Guardian, so big deal cost estimates matter. This story does a decent job summing up the study design and presenting key results from the study, down to the differences between dosage and even placebo groups. While we give the story a satisfactory score on this criterion, we also suggest that the numbers could have been explained far more clearly. Our heads are still spinning a bit from this paragraph in the story: The research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction. A sidebar infographic would have helped, breaking down precisely how many days, how many people, and on what dose. Yes, the results were quantified, but in a less than optimal way. The story teases us with the tidbit that erenumab may come with fewer side effects, yet not one of them or their potential frequency is established. The reported adverse event numbers are important: About 63% of the placebo group experienced at least one, compared to 55.5%-57.3% of the drug groups. Some key numbers from the study are recapped, including how roughly half of patients in the erenumab groups saw an approximately 50% decline in migraine-days-per-month. But the article also compared this result to the placebo group’s result of 26.6%, which suggests perhaps half of the effect might not be attributable to the drug — and added a source’s brief explanation as to why that number may have been so high. (Injections, the source says, tend to trigger strong placebo effects.) A quote by an outside expert highlights the debilitating pain that many migraine sufferers experience, plus the real-world ramifications of that pain. Statistics are provided to give an estimate of how common migraines are, but we think it’s always best practice to provide a source for such statistics, and none was provided by The Guardian. Many news stories fail this test, but this one shines: Not only does the article cite an expert who wasn’t involved in the study, but it also discloses that the drugmakers of erenumab — Amgen and Novartis — funded the study, supplied the drug, and did the data analyses. (One thing the story missed, though: The first draft of the study was put together by a company-funded writer.) The quotes from the principal investigator demand further explanation and context. He calls his study: “an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment….“The results…represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.”  But readers weren’t told anything about other treatments. Imagine taking one of the commonly-used drugs for migraine and now hearing – perhaps for the first time – that it is a poorly understood drug. The story should have explained what treatments the researcher was talking about, and, in an ideal story, would have compared results from this study with what is known about effectiveness of other treatments. More puzzling is why The Guardian didn’t mention in this story that another migraine study was reported in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. And Dr. Peter Goadsby, lead investigator of the study that The Guardian reported on, was also involved in the other study as well. So why mention only one? Is it possible that it’s because the King’s College PR news release only mentioned one? The availability of erenumab was never clear established. Yes, one could deduce that a Phase III trial was just reported, so it probably isn’t on the market yet. But the story never said that. In addition, there can still be a troubled road between completion of a Phase III trial and approval. For a story that trumpeted “incredibly important step forward….start of a real change (in treatment)…first drug in 20 years proven to prevent migraine attacks” and other superlatives, the story could have helped readers see through one trial’s optimism to explain what pitfalls might lie ahead. The story did describe the novelty of laboratory-made antibodies to prevent migraines. But, as already noted in the “Alternatives” criterion above, The Guardian didn’t even mention in this story that another migraine study was reported in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine  involving another antibody drug – fremanezumab. So erenumab – the subject of this story – isn’t the only game in town. It’s not even the only game in this class. What were the results from the fremanezumab study? And how are the two agents different? We got nowhere near those questions – much less answers – from The Guardian in this story. The story quotes the principal investigator, Peter Goadsby, but doesn’t note the source of those quotes: A press release by King’s College London, where Goadsby is a professor. So when The Guardian reports that Goadsby “said” such and such, it implies that he said it directly to someone at The Guardian. But he did not. In fact, we don’t even know if Goadsby “said” those things or wrote them, in a note to the PR people. It’s not a best practice to grab quotes from a PR news release while failing to attribute the source.",1
"""On April 30, 2017, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) provoked an outcry at a town hall meeting in Neenah when pressed to explain his support for defunding the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. A woman doing the questioning warned Grothman that he shouldn’t use Planned Parenthood’s abortion services as an excuse to pull funding, because the agency is already prohibited from using federal funds to support abortion procedures. Grothman’s quick response: """"Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."""" He added that the group is an outspoken advocate for what he termed """"controversial"""" services. To be sure, Planned Parenthood does more than abortions. Services include screening for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control, sex education and general health care. Indeed, in a one-year period from  2014 to 2015, 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood clinics for services other than abortion, PolitiFact Wisconsin found in February 2017. Grothman’s statement about the """"biggest abortion provider"""" was one we’ve seen in various forms from House Speaker Paul Ryan, Cardinal Seán Patrick O’Malley of Boston and National Public Radio. Does it hold up? Running the numbers There’s no complete, centralized database that tallies abortions, much less breaks that number down by providers. But there is strong indirect evidence backing Grothman’s claim. Planned Parenthood self-reports that 323,999 abortions were performed at its facilities nationwide for the year ending September 30, 2015. That represents 35 percent of the 926,200 U.S. abortions estimated for calendar year 2014, the latest year studied by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization whose survey-based data on abortions is widely quoted by both sides in the abortion debate. Grothman maintains 49 percent of abortions are performed by Planned Parenthood. That’s because he uses the smaller base of 664,000 abortions -- the figure reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number is based on voluntary reporting. Here’s what we heard from two groups deeply involved in the abortion issue: -- Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion care in the United States, according to the Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion providers. It’s worth noting that local providers unaffiliated with a national organization -- including freestanding clinics and private practice hospitals -- collectively do the majority of the procedures. -- The 35 percent """"easily"""" makes Planned Parenthood """"the nation's largest abortion chain,"""" and there’s no evidence any other provider is close, according to the National Right to Life Committee. More about Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood’s abortion services grew rapidly between 2000 and 2015, rising by 127,000 procedures at a time when the total number of abortions nationwide was falling significantly. The agency operates some 660 centers across the country. About half offer abortions, according to  agency spokeswoman Beth Lynk. Its facilities see patients from all 50 states, though one state, North Dakota, has no Planned Parenthood health center. The Moorhead, Minn., health center is two blocks from the state border and serves predominately North Dakota patients. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said the agency doesn’t track the numbers on other providers and wouldn’t venture an opinion on Grothman’s claim. But Jennifer Thibodeau, a spokesperson for the Abortion Care Network summed up the general feeling among informed observers this way: """"There is no other national organization that operate on the scale they do."""" Our rating Grothman told constituents that """"Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."""" The agency’s national network of clinics stands apart from other providers as the undisputed leader when it comes to providing abortion services. This is one of those truisms that is basically, well, . (Editor's note, June 7, 2017: An earlier version of this item quoted Grothman as saying that Planned Parenthood is an outspoken advocate for """"controversial"""" services such as birth control. A spokesperson for his office said on June 7, 2017 that the video, in which Grothman's voice is hard to hear at times, may have led people to that conclusion, but that Grothman does not believe birth control is a controversial service. The birth control quote had no bearing on the congressman’s statement about Planned Parenthood and its role in abortions, so the rating of  is unchanged.)""",0
"""Wisconsin isn’t the only state stirring national political headlines. In Michigan, a new law allows the governor to take over local governments deemed to be in financial trouble. Benton Harbor is one of several Michigan municipalities that failed a financial """"stress test"""" and is now under the control of a state-appointed manager who, among other things, has the power to scrap contracts with public employee unions. Local elected officials are no longer in control. Protests are mounting over what critics have called a """"dictatorship"""" and at least once lawsuit claims the measure gives the state """"czar-like"""" powers. Could financial """"martial law"""" declarations be coming to Wisconsin? According to long-time Democratic activist Ed Garvey, such steps are next on the agenda of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. He first raised the issue April 14, 2011 on his  Fightingbob.com blog, then repeated it in subsequent postings, on Wisconsin Public Radio and in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. Rick Ungar, a blogger on Forbes.com, picked up Garvey’s assertions April 16 with a posting entitled """"Gov. Scott Walker Reportedly Planning Financial Martial Law in Wisconsin."""" Two days later, during an April 18 radio interview, Walker vehemently denied being involved with any such plan. So has Garvey exposed Team Walker’s next controversial political push? Now, we can’t rule on prospective claims -- what will happen in the future. But we can look at what Garvey says he has already done -- expose plans that are under way -- and whether his evidence supports his own claim. Let’s go to Garvey’s original blog post. """"We have discovered that Wisconsin's governor has the same twisted idea for Wisconsin as Michigan's governor does of his state,"""" Garvey wrote April 14, 2011 on his blog. """"The state would be allowed to take over local governments if financial management standards are not met. Who decides? The governor or a newly elected uber comptroller. (I am not making this up.)"""" He adds: """"The secret plan is being prepared by the state's largest law firm, Foley & Lardner, for the Greater Milwaukee Committee, the Bradley Foundation, the governor, and key legislators."""" A closer look at the evidence shows it’s not as Machiavellian as Garvey claims. Garvey discovered a recently launched website, Makeityourmilwaukeecounty.com That spells out a legislative initiative. However, it’s hardly a secret. The site is the online version of a project launched by a Greater Milwaukee Committee task force. It’s an outgrowth of a years-long effort by the private business group to study and recommend reforms to Milwaukee County government. The task force’s recommendations drew attention in an Oct. 9, 2010 column by the Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice, who wrote the recommendations were back-burnered so as not to come out before the November election for governor. In November, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at a claim by the state Democratic Party that GMC chairman and Walker campaign chairman Michael Grebe killed release of the report before the election. We said the claim was Barely True. In February, the GMC task force made its recommendations public and the website launched about the same time. The report calls for several initiatives, including: """"Develop a statewide fiscal stress test through the State Department of Revenue to help local governments maintain fiscal health."""" So, the site does talk about a """"stress test,"""" but that’s not the same as the """"martial law"""" style approach in Michigan. In fact, the website explicitly says the group is opposed to that approach: """"The Initiative does not support this type of legislation in Wisconsin."""" What’s more, according to GMC president Julia Taylor, about half the states have a """"fiscal scorecard."""" The thinking, she said, is that the more the public knows about how their local government is faring, the sooner problems can be headed off. Taylor said she wasn’t sure when a bill including the GMC’s plan would be introduced or by whom. """"It’s very, very early in the process,"""" she said. """"At this point we don’t have draft language."""" To be sure, some heavy-hitters are working with the GMC to build support for the recommendations and hammer them into legislation -- including lobbyists with Foley & Lardner, former state legislator Mary Panzer and public relations firm Mueller Communications. And the GMC is chaired by Grebe, who was Walker’s campaign chairman and led the governor’s transition team. Grebe also heads the conservative Bradley Foundation. So, it may be easy to see why Garvey tries to connect some of the dots. What about the essence of Garvey’s claim, that he discovered Walker’s involvement with the plan being discussed -- and, therefore, his support of it? As Milwaukee County executive, Walker expressed support for the GMC efforts. But in the wake of Garvey’s first blog post, he issued a sharp denial about involvement now. """"No truth to it whatsoever. Absolutely a bogus story,"""" Walker said April 18, 2011 in an interview with WTMJ-AM (620)  talk show host Charlie Sykes. """"There's nobody on my staff, nobody in my administration, I'm certainly not working anything remotely close to that."""" Nevertheless, Garvey said in an interview that he still believes that Walker is involved. """"I think that’s true,"""" he said. """"It all sort of fits in with a pattern."""" But thinking something is true and showing it to be true are two different things. Garvey says he discovered a secret plot by Walker to push Michigan-style legislation that would allow the state to test the finances of local governments and then take over the bad apples. The Greater Milwaukee Committee is proposing a """"good-government"""" style website that would allow citizens to compare and contrast the health of local government finances. But it explicitly stops short of a Michigan-style approach. What’s more, Garvey did not uncover it (it was previously announced by the group) and he’s provided no direct evidence of involvement from Walker, who vehemently denies it. The measure could change through the legislative process, but that’s the future. Garvey had a """"scoop."""" But it was more of the gardening -- and not journalistic -- variety.""",1
"""On CBS's Face the Nation on March 28, 2010, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said she will now work to repeal the health care reform bill recently signed by President Barack Obama. """"That's what I believe the American people want us to do,"""" Bachmann said. """"Again the New England Journal of Medicine released a survey the week that President Obama signed Obamacare stating that over 30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession if the government took over health care. That's very serious going forward."""" First things first, the survey Bachmann is referring to was not a survey by the NEJM, nor was it published in the highly respected, peer-reviewed medical journal. It was a survey conducted by the Medicus Firm, a physicians recruiting service, and initially reported in January 2010. The firm wrote an article about the survey results, which was first published on the firm's Web site. The article was later reprinted in Recruiting Physicians Today, an advertising newsletter put out on the NEJM's Career Center Web site. The Medicus Firm neither paid to have the article published, nor was it paid for the article. It was never published in the actual New England Journal of Medicine. But it's easy to see how someone might have been confused. Although the small print explains that the survey was done by the Medicus Firm, the article prominently states at the top, """"From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine"""" and carries the NEJM seal. In mid March, people at the NEJM began to see Twitter messages citing the survey, and calling it an NEJM survey. Jennifer Zeis, a spokeswoman for the New England Journal of Medicine, said NEJM sent out several Tweets explaining that it was not an NEJM survey. And on March 17, 2010, they put up a disclaimer on the NEJM Career Center Web site: """"Recruiting Physicians Today is a free advertiser newsletter published by the Worldwide Advertising Sales and Marketing Department in the publishing division of the Massachusetts Medical Society. Each issue of the newsletter features research and content produced by physician recruiting firms and other independent groups involved in physician employment. """"On December 17, 2009 The Medicus Firm, a national physician search firm based in Dallas and Atlanta, published the results of a survey they conducted with 1,000 physicians regarding their attitudes toward health reform. """"The opinions expressed in the article linked to above represent those of The Medicus Firm only. That article does not represent the opinions of the New England Journal of Medicine or the Massachusetts Medical Society."""" Said Zeis: """"It seems that along the way, people thought this was NEJM content and it wasn't. It had nothing to do with the NEJM editorial side at all."""" Dave Dziok, a spokesman for Bachmann, said any confusion is the fault of the New England Journal of Medicine, not Bachmann. """"I know they’re doing what they can to distance themselves from the survey done by Medicus, but the fact of the matter is the New England Journal of Medicine has leant both its name and crest to the newsletter in which it was published,"""" Dziok said. """"Nowhere in their newsletter do they make the disclaimer that what’s contained within it has nothing to do with the New England Journal of Medicine,"""" he said. """"In fact, quite the contrary seeing as how their name is all over it. The NEJM may not have conducted the research itself as they’re stating now after the fact, but it’s certainly misleading on their end to have their name all over a publication like the one that was released with the results and then distance themselves from everything contained within it afterwards. They can’t have it both ways."""" We note that the NEJM disclaimer went up on the Web site 10 days before Bachmann made her statement on Face the Nation. And the same day the disclaimer was posted, the left-leaning Media Matters Web site explained the error, after it was reported on Fox News. Okay, so the survey was not conducted by or published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But Medicus spokeswoman Andrea Santiago said that while it was not a scientific survey, the results should not be dismissed either. The firm randomly e-mailed surveys to 2,250 physicians from their database of tens of thousands, and stopped sending them out when they had reached 1,195 responses. And contrary to the allegations of some critics, it is not a database entirely made up of doctors looking for work, Santiago said. It's a continuously updated database that originated eight years ago, she said, and includes lists of physicians purchased by the firm. The relevant question here was, """"How do you think the passage of health reform WITHOUT a public option would affect your professional/practice plans, if at all?"""" A majority of physicians, 70 percent, responded, """"no change""""; while 22 percent said they """"would try to retire early""""; 8 percent said they """"would try to leave medical practice even if not near retirement age""""; and 1 percent said they would go back into practicing medicine. """"We feel like it was in line with what we were hearing from physicians on the phone,"""" Santiago said. Many doctors already feel like they are being pushed out of business by declining reimbursement rates and rising malpractice insurance premiums, she said, and """"the health care reform bill exacerbates the issue."""" And it comes at a crucial time, she said, when the legislation will create a demand for many more doctors. However, she said, the results of the survey have been """"over-sensationalized"""" by some as a warning that 30 percent of doctors will be leaving the profession immediately. """"Obviously that's not going to happen,"""" she said, noting that the survey didn't ask point-blank if physicians were going to leave, but rather if they would """"try"""" to leave. """"But I do think it's going to impact the workforce in a significant way. We thought the results were thought-provoking."""" We haven't found a reliable, independent poll of physicians asking how many would leave the profession if the health care bill passed that we could compare to the Medicus survey. The findings are consistent with a survey conducted by Investor's Business Daily back in September 2009, but we looked at that survey in October after it was cited by Glenn Beck, and concluded the results were suspect due to a number of possible influences on results. We note that the New England Journal of Medicine's Health Reform Center did publish the results of a physician survey conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the Medicus poll did, but it did find that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, which is in sharp contrast to the findings of the Medicus survey. In our previous story, we noted several factors with that survey that gave us pause about that study, such as the fact that the poll received financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which favors health care reform, that the authors belong to a physicians organization that supports a public option, and that they donated to the Obama campaign. Still, according to an NEJM spokeswoman, the survey underwent a rigorous editorial review process that included review by staff and associate editors. In other words, it got the NEJM stamp of approval, whereas the Medicus survey did not. In conclusion, surveys performed by or published in the New England Journal of Medicine carry the weight of the journal's reputation and rigorous editorial review. Citing them as the source of a survey, as Bachmann did, lends credibility. But it was not an NEJM survey. Nor was it published in the NEJM. It was published in a free advertising newsletter geared toward the physician recruitment industry. It was conducted by a physician recruiting service that has a horse in this race. And it was not a scientific survey. We can understand how Bachmann and others may have been confused about the source of the survey. The labeling of the article as """"From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine"""" is easy to misconstrue. An NEJM spokesman said they are reviewing their policies to make sure this kind of confusion doesn't happen again. But on top of getting the source wrong, we think Bachmann sensationalizes the Medicus results, saying that """"30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession"""" if the health care bill passed. The survey language was that they would """"try to leave"""" or """"try to retire early"""" if it passed. There's a difference.""",1

"Dr. Keith Albow wrote a column in February 2017 that concluded President Trump is “stone cold sane” and that, based on his business empire, Trump is a genius. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, and in the opening months of Trump’s presidency, however, Dr. Keith Albow has not made his support for Trump — and his opposition to Hillary Clinton — a secret. It should also be noted that Albow has routinely disclosed that he’s never personally evaluated the president in an in-person examination. The commentary written by Dr. Keith Albow on President appeared at Fox News in February 2017 under the headline, “Relax, Trump is Stone Cold Sane.” After acknowledging that he has never personally examined Trump, Albow wrote: Donald Trump is stone cold sane. When a man acquires billions of dollars through complex real estate transactions, invests in many countries, goes on to phenomenal success in television and turns his name into a worldwide brand, it is very unlikely that he is mentally unstable. When the same man obviously enjoys the love and respect of his children and his wife, who seem to rely on him for support and guidance, it is extraordinarily unlikely that he is mentally unstable. When the same man walks into the political arena and deftly defeats 16 Republican opponents and then the Democratic heir-apparent to a two-term president’s administration, the odds of that man being mentally unstable become vanishingly thin. Dr. Keith Albow also pointed the stock market rally after President Trump’s inauguration as evidence that the president was sane because the market doesn’t like uncertainty and investors “can take the measure of a man pretty darn well.” Albow’s column was widely circulated via forwarded emails and in social media posts. Many times the commentary was described as a letter by Dr. Keith Albow on Trump, but it was actually an op-ed published by Fox News. Dr. Keith Albow also spoke about President Trump’s mental stability during the campaign. Albow said on Fox News, via a transcript and video posted at the left-wing media watchdog Media Matters for America website, that Trump had demonstrated great restraint when the size of his hands became a topic of discussion during a debate: “Well, sure, it’s something that every candidate probably does, probably should do. Psychology’s a very powerful tool to unearth what does get under people’s skin, if you will. But listen, with Donald Trump, kind of what you see is what you get. I have to say, when the small hands issue was raised during the debate, this supposedly got the Clinton campaign very excited. They thought, “Man, he’s off his game.” He wasn’t off his game at all. Freud would have been standing up, like applauding, standing ovation. To be able to address such an intensely personal issue and say, “Listen, there’s no problem in that department,” to me that showed an incredible degree of psychological strength. With Donald Trump, he may err, he may make errors in saying what he thinks, telling us the truth, saying things that are gritty, perhaps attacking with some unkind words, which he could scale back, but you know what, his demons are on his sleeve. There’s not a lot of psychoanalysis that hasn’t been presented already.” In addition to supporting Trump, Dr. Keith Albow also openly opposed Hillary Clinton’s candidacy during the 2016 election. In September 2016, Albow penned another column that appeared at Fox News under the headline, “Dr. Keith Ablow: Hillary Clinton — Inside the mind of a shameless liar.” In the column, Albow concludes: Hillary Clinton is the one whose psychological make up would seem to leave her vulnerable. Her penchant for lying is a problem, but the really big problem is that she seems unable to determine when her lies are registering with audiences as clearly untrue. At the core, people who lie transparently do so because they lack empathy—the ability to intuit and vicariously experience what others are thinking and feeling. Locked behind walls of narcissism or arrogance or imperiousness, consumed with the pursuit of power, they can’t tell convincing lies because they can’t truly resonate with how their words and mannerisms are being received. It’s important to note that in publicly rendering his opinion on both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton without an in-person examination, Albow defied the American Psychology Association’s so-called “Goldwater Rule,” which prohibits mental health professionals from rendering opinions on subjects without first examining them. Just as in the case of rumors that President Trump is suffering from dementia (a claim we found to unproven), any claims made by mental health professionals about politicians without first examining them should be considered their personal, not medical, opinion.

"""Amid a growing awareness that sex trafficking is a problem in Rhode Island, the public access program """"State of the State"""" broadcast a discussion of the issue. During the show, host Rebecca Quigley offered several statistics about sex workers. One in particular caught our ear. """"Once a woman enters into the sex trade,"""" she said, """"her average life expectancy is seven years, with AIDS and homicide as the top killers."""" So if a 18-year-old woman starts working as a prostitute, she's likely to be dead by age 25? We decided to check out that provocative statistic. We found the claim echoed in many sites on the Internet, including Ohio Catholic Conference, The Straight Dope, CNN and others. In contrast, we located a 2004 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that used 33 years of data to examine the lives of female prostitutes in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Nearly 2,000 were ultimately tracked. Some had been in the business for a few years, others for much longer. The researchers found that fewer than 8 percent died over the three decades. When we tracked down the authors, they said the actual life expectancy, like so many statistics used in the prostitution debate, isn't really known. But, they said, it's not seven years. """"If you had a life expectancy that short, you'd have difficulty replenishing the pool with new prostitutes,"""" said coauthor Devon D. Brewer, who directs Interdisciplinary Scientific Research, a Seattle-based research and consulting firm. """"It's tough to put into words how dramatic an overstatement that is. There's zero basis that I'm aware of for making statements like that."""" """"The truth is, the vast majority of women who enter into prostitution leave the trade alive, so to say a life expectancy of seven years . . . There is no basis for anything that incredibly dramatic,"""" he said. """"That's a statement that gains credence because it's repeated so often and it perhaps has very little to do with reality,"""" said chief author John J. Potterat, now retired from the El Paso County Department of Health and Environment in Colorado Springs. When we heard back from Quigley, she cited several sources we had seen that made the same claim, including an article from Emergency Physicians Monthly that traced a variant of the claim to Melissa Farley, clinical psychologist, founder and director of Prostitution Research and Education, based in San Francisco. She's an anti-prostitution activist. Farley told us that, although she's heard the statistic, she's never seen any documentation to back it up. What is true, the experts all agreed, is that prostitution is a very dangerous profession. The fact that the seven-year statistic is wrong, said Brewer, the Seattle scholar, """"doesn't take away from the fact that the risk of death that prostitute women face is higher than any other set of women ever studied, at least the risk of homicide. Does that mean most prostitutes are getting killed? No. It means compared to other women in other professions it's the one you're mostly likely to be murdered in."""" Brewer and his colleagues estimated that the women they studied faced a 1 percent chance of being murdered during their prostitution career. That murder rate, by the way, has also spawned another bogus statistic — that prostitutes typically die around age 34. What Brewer, Potterat and their colleagues actually found was that among the 21 prostitutes in their study who were murdered, their average age when they died was 34. As retired call girl Maggie McNeill noted last year in the Washington Post, to say that's """"the average life expectancy of all street workers, or of all sex workers . . . would be analogous to saying that because the average soldier who is killed in battle is 21 years old, the average man who joins the military dies at 21."""" Quigley's best source supporting her claim — and one we found as well — was the FBI. In an FBI document titled """"FY 2011 Budget Request At A Glance,"""" the bureau asks for $333 million and 831 positions to fight child exploitation. The fact sheet claims, """"Studies estimate between 200,000 and 300,000 children are being forced into prostitution at any given time in the United States. The average age of a new child prostitute is 13, and the life expectancy after becoming a child prostitute is 7 years."""" No source is cited. We couldn't find another FBI document that repeated the seven-year claim. So the FBI was only talking about child prostitution, not prostitution in general. And when we contacted the FBI, the agency repudiated the statistic. Spokesman Christopher M. Allen said that after checking with the bureau's Violent Crimes Against Children Section, it appears that the seven-year life expectancy claim may have come from a case the FBI handled, one that involved several victims. """"It should not be considered a general statement of FBI findings,"""" Allen wrote in an email. Our ruling Rebecca Quigley said, """"Once a woman enters into the sex trade, her average life expectancy is seven years."""" She — like many others on the Internet — are incorrectly quoting a FBI budget report that only deals with child prostitution and offers no documentation. And the FBI is now trying to set the record straight. There’s little doubt that prostitution can be one of the most dangerous endeavors undertaken by a woman. But the seven-year claim is flat out .

"Benzene is a harmful chemical that can exist both   inside vehicles and in the open air but warnings such as this eRumor about airing out your car interior   may be overblown. The American Chemical Society released a report in 2007 saying that   the interiors of motor vehicles were found to contain of  a “wide   variety of synthetic materials, which emit volatile organic compounds.”    The investigation concluded that there was no indication of the   emissions being any sort of “apparent health hazard of parked motor   vehicle indoor air.”   Click for report. Benzene comes from   coal and petroleum products and is one   of the most commonly made chemicals in the United States. It is a colorless liquid with a sweet   smell that evaporates when it makes contact with the air. Benzene   is present in cigarette smoke, car exhausts, and can also be found in glues and   paints, according to the Center   for Disease Control (CDC). The   CDC   Fact Sheet on Benzene says, “Breathing in unusually high doses of   benzene can cause difficulty in thinking, changes in heart function,   unconsciousness, or death. In smaller amounts over longer periods of   time, benzene can also decrease the formation of blood cells. Benzene is   considered to be a cancer-causing chemical.”   Exposure   to benzene can come from consuming contaminated food or beverages but   most people come into contact with it by breathing it in the air. The   CDC says, “Benzene gets into the air from forest fires, car emissions,   gasoline vapors, and tobacco smoke. People who work with petroleum   products, including gasoline, are exposed to benzene by touching or   breathing in the chemical.”  This warning   might have been sparked by a report from almost decade ago by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research   Organization (CSIRO). In a  December 19, 2001 report, the organization found “high levels of air   toxic emissions in new motor vehicles for up to six months and longer   after they leave the showroom.” That research, however was conducted on   three automobiles manufactured in Australia and one imported vehicle,   the origin of which was not revealed. updated 04/29/10 Comments",1
"""There was no discussion of the costs involved with hormone replacement therapy although, with a story about risks of HRT, it is somewhat understandable that a discussion of costs was not vital. The story does not quantify the risks of hormone therapy, in absolute terms or otherwise. This is particularly important for this subject because the risks involved are relatively small. For example, in the study, the risk of breast cancer was less than one half of one percent per year in the hormone therapy group. The story mentions blood clots, breast cancer, and heart attack as risks of hormone therapy. Other than to describe the study as """"sweeping"""" the story does not adequately describe the strength of the new evidence. Most importantly, the story does not explain that these findings do not necessarily apply to younger women who take hormone therapy for shorter periods of time.

The story briefly mentions that """"many women taking HRT are getting a treatment which is considered safer, often at half the dose and only for a couple of years"""" but that gives the viewer little information about what that option is or how much safer it may be.

"Outlining a global plan to fight the viral disease and get ahead of a potential global outbreak, the WHO said the next influenza pandemic “is a matter of when, not if”. “The threat of pandemic influenza is ever-present,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said in a statement. “We must be vigilant and prepared – the cost of a major influenza outbreak will far outweigh the price of prevention.”  The world’s last flu pandemic was caused by the H1N1 virus, which spread around the world in 2009 and 2010. Studies of that pandemic found that at least one in five people worldwide were infected in the first year, and the death rate was 0.02 percent. Global health experts and the WHO warn there is a risk that a more deadly flu virus will one day jump from animals to people, mutate and infect many hundreds of thousands of people. Flu viruses are multiple and ever-changing, and they infect around a billion people every year around the world in seasonal outbreaks. Of those infections, around 3 to 5 million are severe cases, leading to between 290,000 and 650,000 seasonal flu-related respiratory deaths. Vaccines can help prevent some cases, and the WHO recommends annual vaccination - especially for people working in health care and for vulnerable people such as the old, the very young and people with underlying illness. The WHO plan - which it described as its most comprehensive to date - includes measures to try to protect populations as much as possible from annual outbreaks of seasonal flu, as well as prepare for a pandemic. Its two main goals, the WHO said, are to improve worldwide capacities for surveillance and response - by urging all governments to develop a national flu plan, and to develop better tools to prevent, detect, control and treat flu, such as more effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.",0
"""Florida’s closely watched U.S. Senate race pits incumbent Republican Marco Rubio against Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy. Recently, Rubio got some help from the free-market group Americans for Prosperity, which created an ad attacking Murphy as """"Pay-More Patrick."""" One of the claims in the ad was an attack on Murphy’s support for the Affordable Care Act, a law sometimes called Obamacare after the president who signed it into law. In the ad, a narrator says, """"Patrick Murphy says he wants to serve in the U.S. Senate, but who does he really want to serve? As a member of Congress, ‘Pay-More’ Patrick has voted for big payouts to special interests. Our health care premiums are going up, and 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance. And yet, ‘Pay-More’ Patrick voted not once, not twice, but nine times for Obamacare."""" Here, we’ll check the assertion that """"300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance"""" as a result of Obamacare. Where the number came from The 300,000 figure has a long history. As we have noted previously, it stems from the 300,000 policyholders in October 2013 who received notices from the insurance company Florida Blue that their insurance plans didn’t meet the new rules under the Affordable Care Act. Those rules were intended to phase out """"bare bones"""" plans that didn’t include features like prescription drug coverage or hospital stays. Florida Blue sent those 300,000 customers letters informing them that their plans would end and offering guidance on how to get signed up for a new plan. """"Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them,"""" the company said at the time. """"Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014."""" Opponents of the Affordable Care Act seized on the 300,000 number as a sign of problems for the newly implemented law, and it became an issue during the 2014 campaign cycle. Twice, we took issue with the use of the statistic for not providing full context about the number. Rubio himself earned a rating for saying, """"300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance."""" Since the company provided assistance with switching plans, we argued that Rubio was jumping the gun by saying flatly that they wouldn’t have insurance. What has happened since? So what happened to those 300,000 people in the succeeding three years? As it turns out, the vast majority of the 300,000 found coverage -- with Florida Blue. """"More than 80 percent of the approximately 300,000 members remained with Florida Blue,"""" company spokesman Paul C. Kluding told PolitiFact. That would leave at most 60,000 people -- not 300,000 -- who lost their health insurance as a result of that provision of the law. But even that number is probably high. Remember, the 80 percent figure refers to the policyholders who remained with Florida Blue. But the other 20 percent didn’t necessarily become uninsured -- they just didn’t get a Florida Blue plan. They could have found another private plan, or they could have found other private insurance -- including a plan purchased on one of the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. So at the very least, the ad reanimates a years-old number that was known to be preliminary and in flux. Florida’s new insurance signups The use of the 300,000 number is misleading in a second way: It ignores the coverage gains of the Affordable Care Act in the state. More than 1.7 million Floridians purchased plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces between Nov. 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2016. And the number affected by the law could have been many more if Florida had moved to expand Medicaid under the law, as many other states did. This is a big enough increase to wipe out the 300,000 policies """"lost"""" -- which, as we noted, is an exaggerated number -- and it positively dwarfs the 60,000 number, which itself might be exaggerated. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on Florida can be seen clearly in newly released federal data on uninsured residents in every state. In 2013, 20 percent of Floridians lacked health coverage. In 2014, that number fell to 16.6 percent, and in 2015, it fell again to 13.3 percent. That’s a decrease in Florida’s uninsured population by one-third over two years. Americans for Prosperity responds Andres Malave, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, made several arguments for why the message of the ad was valid. One is that those 300,000 faced administrative headaches in continuing their insurance or finding a new plan, sometimes more than once. He also had a point that not all of the 1.7 million residents who purchased a marketplace plan were uninsured before that. However, the overall uninsured rates suggest that many people were indeed moving from uninsured to insured over the previous two years. (Malave argued that the recovering economy in the state deserves credit for the higher insurance coverage rates, rather than just the Affordable Care Act.) Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said that """"300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance"""" as a result of Obamacare. Even in 2013 this assertion was not entirely correct, and now, more than three years later, we know it’s not correct. Only about 60,000 people failed to re-up with Florida Blue, and there’s a good chance that many of those 60,000 found coverage elsewhere -- including through the Obamacare exchanges. Indeed, in the most recent year, the Obamacare marketplace has enabled 1.7 million Floridians to sign up for coverage, a far bigger number than the losses cited in the ad. Finally, the uninsured rate in Florida has fallen by one-third since 2013, which paints a very different picture than the ad’s zombie statistic.""",1
"On 15 February 2017, the web site ConservativeDailyPost.com published an inaccurate story bearing the headline, “Post-Emergency Report Concludes: CA Governor Directed Critical Dam Funds To Programs For Illegals,” and reporting that a nonexistent post-emergency report found that California governor Jerry Brown spent $25 billion on programs for undocumented immigrants rather than investing in fixing the Oroville Dam, leading to current dangerous conditions in Northern California: Despite warnings about the flood danger posed by the Oroville Dam twelve years ago, flaky California Democratic Governor Jerry Brown ignored the warnings in favor of spending $25 billion per year on illegal immigrants. Now the chickens are coming home to roost as rainstorms later in the week could cause the neglected portion of the dam to dump large amounts of water on downtown Oroville. Brown stands revealed as spending money on unlawful immigrants rather than protecting the more than 20 million farmers and residential consumers the dam provides water to. While it is true that environmental groups have been warning state and federal authorities about structural deficiencies at Oroville Dam since well before Brown took office, the dam and programs for undocumented immigrants are funded from separate budget sources, thus spending on one does not impact the other. Ted Thomas, spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, told us: Lake Oroville is part of the State Water Project, which is owned and operated by the California Department of Water Resources. All of the construction, operation, and maintenance costs of the State Water Project are paid by the 29 public water agencies (known as the SWP contractors) that take delivery of water from the project. ConservativeDailyPost.com linked to an article from the Washington Times, which quoted conservatives critical of the California governor for failing to address issues with the dam while spending on programs for undocumented people and a high-speed rail project. The article cites others who said President Trump should help repair the dam, instead of building a new wall at the U.S.-Mexico border: Critics of California’s willingness to spend billions of dollars on high-speed rail and services for illegal immigrants were quick to draw parallels to the state’s failure to invest in the Oroville Dam. The cost of fixing the spillway alone is now $200 million. Charlie Kirk, founder of conservative student group Turning Point USA, fired off a meme Monday saying, “California Governor Jerry Brown spends $25 billion per year to support illegal immigrants/I wonder how much Governor Brown spent to maintain the Oroville Dam?” Others defended Mr. Brown, pointing out that the emergency spillway had never been used until this year and that the catastrophic rainstorms came as a shock, especially after five years of drought. Still others turned the crisis into an opportunity to blast Mr. Trump, saying he should repair the Oroville Dam instead of building a wall on the southern border. While the article doesn’t say where Kirk’s meme sourced its “$25 billion” figure, a 2014 study by immigrant reduction proponents Federation for American Immigration Reform claimed that undocumented immigrants cost the Golden State $25.3 billion annually. The claim is questionable, however, because the group lumps U.S. citizens born to undocumented immigrants in with non-citizen children when estimating the cost of education: Nearly half of those expenditures ($12.3 billion) result from the costs of K-12 education for the children of illegal aliens — both those illegally in the country and those born in the United States. Another major outlay ($2.1 billion) results from the need to provide supplemental English language instruction to Limited English Proficient students, many of whom are children of illegal aliens. Together, these educational costs are 57.1 percent of total expenditures. Further, the study is vague about items like how researchers estimated public safety and judicial costs and what figures they used to estimate health care costs — and here again, the group lumped in children who are American citizens born to undocumented parents along with children who are undocumented. We could not locate any confirmation that undocumented people cost California taxpayers $25 billion yearly, and this report appears flawed because it includes American citizens in its estimation of that cost. What is true is that environmental experts have been warning officials since at least 2003 about the now-compromised spillway that is threatening to collapse and flood communities below. As early as 2003, Friends of the River, the Sierra Club, and the South Yuba River Citizens League have been warning state and federal officials that the spillway was unsound. In a 2003 letter, the groups wrote: We are concerned that the physical structure of the ungated spillway may not comport well with the exist well with the existing reservoir regulation manual that calls for use of reservoir surcharge space by utilizing the Dam’s ungated spillway when appropriate…  At present, the ungated spillway at Oroville Dam consists of a spillway lip only – and utilizes a hillside as the project spillway. Utilizing such a spillway has the potential to cause severe damage to the downstream hillside, project facilities, and downstream environments located in the path of the flood release… We do not believe that it is in the Department’s best interest to pursue a relicensing strategy that might in practice reduce the effective flood control space at Oroville Dam. Rather, it would seem prudent to seek approval from FERC for modifications to the Dam such as the construction of a spillway below the ungated spillway lip that would allow Dam operators to operate the Dam consistent with the existing and desired flood operation rules without causing significant damages or disruption to project land and facilities. The Washington Post explains: In October 2005, as the Oroville Dam was going through a re-licensing process, the three groups filed a motion urging a federal regulatory agency to require state officials to armor the emergency spillway with concrete so that in the event of extreme rain and flooding, water would not freely cascade down and erode the hillside. The upgrade would have cost millions of dollars and no one wanted to foot the bill, said Ronald Stork, senior policy advocate for Friends of the River, one of the groups that filed the motion. “When the dam is overfull, water goes over that weir and down the hillside, taking much of the hillside with it,” Stork told The Washington Post. “That causes huge amounts of havoc. There’s roads, there’s transmission lines, power lines that are potentially in the way of that water going down that auxiliary spillway.” Federal officials, however, determined that nothing was wrong and the emergency spillway, which can handle 350,000 cubic feet of water per second, “would perform as designed” and sediment resulting from erosion would be insignificant, according to a July 2006 memo from John Onderdonk, then a senior civil engineer for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Eleven years later, flooding due to mid-February 2017 storms forced nearly 200,000 residents living in the dam’s shadow to evacuate their homes. As of 16 February 2017, crews are working to shore up the structure as more heavy rain is expected in the coming week. Stork told us: We were told not to worry our pretty little heads and they just ignored the issue of throwing the hillside into the channel below, saying that would never happen. Mother Nature just demonstrated they were incorrect.",1
"""In a video ad, Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Leticia Van de Putte presents Republican nominee Dan Patrick as too extreme on vital public safety issues. The ad’s narrator initially says Patrick, a Houston senator, """"would deny victims of rape any options at all,"""" a claim rooted in Patrick’s statement in a January 2014 debate that he would permit an abortion only to save the life of an endangered mother. """"And,"""" the narrator says, """"he voted against funding to test the backlog of rape kits. Allowing rapists to walk free."""" Patrick, the narrator says, """"is just too dangerous."""" Did Patrick vote against testing backlogged rape kits, letting rapists walk? Van de Putte cites Patrick vote against 2014-15 state budget Manny Garcia, a spokesman for Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator, told us by email the basis of her rape-kit claim was Patrick’s vote against the final version of the overall 2014-15 state budget that cleared the Senate in May 2013. A backup document Garcia sent over noted a June 6, 2013, Texas Tribune news story stating that the budget allotted $11 million to the Texas Department of Public Safety """"to help address the state’s massive backlog of untested rape kits. """"In 2011,"""" the story said, """"the Legislature passed Senate Bill 1636, by state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, which requires that state law enforcement agencies report the number of untested rape kits and submit a certain number to DPS for testing."""" The story said the new funding would  """"cover the outsourcing costs to have the kits tested, and DPS estimates that based on historical data, about half of the untested kits will yield traces of DNA."""" According to legislative records, Davis in May 2011 won unanimous Senate approval of her proposal when it was sent to the House and again in the body’s concurrence with House amendments--meaning Patrick voted """"aye"""" twice as well. We asked the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault about the impact of the funding. A staff attorney, Chris Kaiser, said by email the tests are just starting to happen, but it’s """"reasonable to assume that out of all those kits there will be some investigations and prosecutions resulting from DNA hits. However, we’re talking about fairly long-term effects of the 82nd Legislature’s funding, not immediate analysis that is helping to scoop offenders off the streets today."""" Patrick’s actions in 2013 session Next, we focused on Patrick’s actions. As noted in a previous fact check, Patrick was among four senators who voted against the final version of the 2014-15 state budget. In a May 30, 2013, public interview with the Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith, Patrick said he voted """"no"""" -- after backing earlier versions -- because education initiatives, including funds to pay for students to take the SAT, weren’t in it. He did not mention the budgeted money to test the kits. Legislative records show Patrick supporting, and even having a hand in launching, the spending to test the kits. Patrick serves on the Senate Finance Committee, which on March 13, 2013, unanimously voted in favor of the panel’s version of Senate Bill 1, the budget act, including the money for testing the kits. To our inquiry about Patrick’s position on the rape-kit expenditure in the 2013 session, Torie Camp, an Austin consultant who was then a TAASA official, emailed us what she described as a March 13, 2013, Senate Finance Committee document indicating Patrick was among a subset of senators to initially put the kit funding into the budget. The document, including the typed notation """"tentative work group decisions,"""" indicates several committee members, including Patrick, were tasked as a """"work group"""" with resolving the finance panel’s public safety new spending items. And, the document indicates, those senators by that date had agreed to pencil in $10.95 million in state revenue to pay for outsourcing DNA screening and testing services for approximately 10,000 sexual assault kits a year. (The document is also posted online by the Legislative Budget Board which has also posted a similar document indicating the commitment of money to the kits was an unsettled issue for senators as of Feb. 12, 2013.) On March 20, 2013, Patrick was among 28 senators who voted to advance the budget (including the kit-test funding) to the House, according to the Senate Journal entry for that day. Two senators (though not Patrick) voted """"no."""" Generally in the 2013 session, Camp said by phone, """"we never got a sense that anybody was opposed to this money in there. This wasn’t something anybody wanted to oppose."""" Rapists walking free? Camp said that after the budget took effect in September 2013, DPS proceeded to bid out the tests of the kits to private laboratories which, Camp said, started working through kits in fall 2014. Camp said it makes sense that some of the resulting DNA """"hits,"""" to be passed along by DPS to local police departments, will lead to individuals being convicted of assaults -- and be taken off the streets. For now,"""" she said, """"we’re just not far enough into the process to know we’re going to take sexual offenders off the streets. But my guess is we will."""" By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said that effective June 2014, the agency had an agreement for the University of North Texas Health Science Center to test about 1,000 kits. Also, Vinger said, the department has contracted with companies in Dallas and Virginia to test the kits. """"In the coming months, we will ultimately direct agencies where to send their kits,"""" he said. """"The actual testing is expected to take place over two years."""" Vinger said DPS doesn’t track successful prosecutions related to sexual assault testing  — whether via kits or other evidence. Vinger also said """"backlog"""" is misleading in reference to the kits now being tested since most of them hadn’t previously been submitted to a crime lab for testing, based on decisions by local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, he said. In August 2013, according to a New York Times/Texas Tribune news story published at the time, DPS estimated there were close to 20,000 untested kits statewide per information from various law enforcement agencies. The story said the untested kits had collected in police evidence rooms amid tight budgets, overworked crime labs and, in some cases, determinations by authorities that there was insufficient cause to test a kit. By email, we pointed out to Van de Putte that Patrick evidently played a role in initially putting the money for testing the kits into the budget and there is no indication his vote against the full final budget allowed rapists to walk. Garcia, stressing Patrick’s opposition to the final budget, emailed: """"If it was up to him alone, the budget would not have passed at that point in time, Meaning that testing for the rape kits would not be funded."""" Our ruling Van de Putte said Patrick voted """"against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free."""" This claim is flawed in various ways -- starting with blaming Patrick for a result that didn’t come to be. In reality, Patrick appears to have been among senators to initially put the kit-test funding into the state budget. And while he voted against the final overall budget, there’s no indication he did so to stop the kits from being tested. Also, the contention that rapists walked free as a result of Patrick’s action is incorrect. The funding (to repeat) passed into law. When a statement is incorrect and ridiculous, the Truth-O-Meter warms up in a hurry. ! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.""",1
"While WebMD missed the cost component, Reuters smartly raised this issue and discussed how future research will be funded. “All of the funding for the University of Pennsylvania’s gene therapy work has come from the academic community, but the work is expensive. ‘We are looking for corporate partners as we head into Phase II trials,’ Kalos said.” As in the WebMD story, this story stated that, “Two participants in the Phase I trial have been in remission for up to a year. A third had a strong anti-tumor response, and his cancer remains in check.” The WebMD story provided more details, though. The story gave short shrift to potential harms. The WebMD story stated more plainly that patients suffered debilitating side effects and, in one case, had to be treated with steroids that may have hindered the effectiveness of the cancer therapy. The story allowed the study’s authors, who are understandably excited by the findings, to make overly effusive statements that overshadow some of the more cautionary notes in the story. For example, the story quotes Dr. Michael Kalos saying, “We put a key onto the surface of the T-cells that fits into a lock that only the cancer cells have.” The story then goes on to say that the patients “had to be treated with an immunity-boosting drug since the targeted molecule, CD-19, is also present on certain normal immune-system cells.” That doesn’t sound like a key that only fits cancer. The story could have overtly addressed this dissonace to help explain it to readers who may have been confused. The story did not engage in disease-mongering. Both stories cited just one outside source. The Reuters story, though, did a superior job here by quoting someone who had some words of caution. Dr. Walter Urba of the Providence Cancer Center in Portland warned that “the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown.” We were surprised to see no mention of radiation, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants in this story. At a minimum, the WebMD story discussed bone marrow transplants. The story does note the study is a Phase 1 trial iin the 4th sentence and also notes that researchers intend to enroll four more subjects. WebMD did a better job showing that, even for people hoping to enroll in a trial for this therapy, the odds will be long. We wish stories would take for granted that readers know what Phase I and Phase II means. Satisfactory job establishing the novelty – even in the first line of the story. Neither story relied on this University of Pennsylvania news release.",0
"Costs were reported. Much more clearly than the competing WSJ story, Reuters reported: “”Testing might lead to more harm than good.” Unlike the competing Wall Street Journal story, this story was clear about the potential harms: “it’s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.” Clear, succinct summary of the evidence. No disease mongering. An author of the paper, and the author of an accompanying editorial were quoted. The story ends with the researcher saying “doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.” The story was clear that the scans are not currently recommended by guidelines but that “there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.” The relative novelty of the screening test could be deduced from the story. It’s clear that the story did not rely on a news release.",0
"""At the AP Legislative Planning Session on Jan. 19, 2011, Florida’s chief financial officer lobbed a claim about auto insurance shenanigans. """"Of the top five cities for staged automobile accidents, three are in Florida. … We rank No. 1 in the country in staged auto accidents,"""" Jeff Atwater said. We have long known that Florida is special, the reluctant recipient of certain superlatives. These two claims seemed almost too good to be true, but were they? We decided to delve in. Atwater made the remarks less than a week after the topic of fabricating car crashes for cash grabbed several headlines, including a front-page story in the Jan. 16 edition of the Miami Herald. A story earlier in the week chronicled the arrest of five people in Miami-Dade and a sixth in Naples. They were charged with faking car accidents after police say they hired people to stage wrecks or file false claims with insurance companies using drivers’ personal injury protection insurance policies. All told, the scammers billed insurance companies up to $170,000 for medical treatment that was never performed, according to the Florida Division of Insurance Fraud. The issue of fraud related to personal injury protection, or PIP, insurance has been of interest to Atwater. His office issued a press release reporting that PIP-related fraud costs the average Florida family as much as $400 a year. Four Florida cities are among the top 10 in PIP fraud – Hialeah, Tampa, Orlando and, yes, Miami. The Herald reported that more than 400 people were charged in the past two years with PIP fraud. And so, Atwater vowed to keep a spotlight on PIP fraud. """"The thieves committing these scams need to know that it’s my plan to put them behind bars,"""" said Atwater, a Republican from North Palm Beach. It was only a few days later that Atwater talked about the fraud cases in Florida at the AP meeting. According to spokeswoman Alexis Lambert, his statements were based on a May 10, 2010, report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an Illinois not-for-profit that teams up with various insurers and law enforcement agencies in an effort to prosecute insurance criminals. The study showed that reports of """"staged accident questionable claims"""" spiked 46 percent from 2007 through 2009. The top five states that generated the most """"staged accident QCs,"""" or questionable claims, were: (1) Florida, 3,006; (2) New York, 1,680; (3) California, 1,619; (4) Texas, 792; and (5) Illinois, 433. The five cities that saw the """"most staged accident QCs"""" were: (1) New York, 1,304; (2) Tampa, 562; (3) Miami, 511 (4) Orlando, 422; and (5) Houston, 376. These revelations don’t come as a surprise to observers. """"I think it’s a generality that Florida ranks well up there,"""" said James Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a Washington, D.C., anti-fraud watchdog. """"I don’t think anyone who sees the national picture will dispute that."""" According to a 2007-2008 report from the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, Florida led the nation in 2005 in the recovery of insurance fraud-related losses through court-ordered restitution. These court findings suggest Florida has ranked high across the board. Despite his intention to put a spotlight on auto insurance fraud, Atwater fails to note that the numbers are for """"questionable claims."""" These, according to National Insurance Crime Bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi, are not the same as actual staged accidents. An analogy might be the difference between a charge and a conviction. The terms may often be used interchangeably, but law enforcement personnel and attorneys certainly know the difference. """"We stress to people to keep in mind that these are initial referrals and not definitive acts of fraud, although most of these will certainly be fraud,"""" Scafidi wrote in an e-mail message. Scafidi elaborated. In 2009, NICB reports that there were 85,201 questionable claims submitted and just 4,802 of that number were related to staged accidents. In an average year, he notes, more than 48 million claims are filed by the Insurance Services Office, a company that maintains claims data. That said, only 0.17 percent of the claims were deemed suspicious or questionable, and only about one in 20 of those involved questions of staged accidents. The sample is not enough to draw conclusions on, Scafidi added, but, """"It is a useful tool for analysis and for us to see where the potential fraud hot spots are."""" Atwater is mostly correct about the high numbers of auto fraud cases coming from Florida, but he neglects to mention that the numbers he referred to are """"questionable claims,"""" not yet confirmed as actual staged accidents. It’s an important detail. For omitting that clarification.""",0
"""Editors note: This item was revised on April 1, 2014 to reflect the fact that increases of 300 and 800 percent represent four- and nine-fold increases respectively. The ruling remains the same. In the debate over whether marijuana should be legalized, one issue is the question of potency. Critics of legalization argue that the street drug now available for sale is not the marijuana that a lot of baby boomers and Generation Xers have used. One of them, Heidi Heilman, director of New England field development for Smart Approaches to Marijuana and president of the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, raised the issue March 13 in a commentary in The Providence Journal. """"Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear,"""" she wrote. """"Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana — especially for kids with developing brains."""" THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, available by prescription, is the key active ingredient in marijuana. It's well established that the potency of marijuana has increased over time. On Jan. 24, PolitiFact national ruled that when former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy said that marijuana today is """"genetically modified,"""" with THC levels that """"far surpass the marijuana"""" of the 1970s. Heilman was being more specific. Because something 100 percent more potent is actually twice as potent, she was saying that the potency of today's marijuana is now four to nine times greater than """"yesteryear,"""" a rather vague starting point. Nonetheless, we wanted to see if her statement was on target or her statistic was a bit high. Heilman was quick to send us several pieces of information. The first was a graph showing a rapid increase in potency from 1960 to 2011, a 52-year span. It shows the ratio of THC in marijuana going from 0.2 percent to 11.4 percent. That's an increase of 5,700 percent, well outside the range cited by Heilman. But are those numbers reliable? The graph says the information came from a study in the Journal of Forensic Science. But that study was published in 2010, and only covered a 16-year period that ends in 2008. Its authors, researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, examined 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. They found that the THC concentrations of marijuana had risen by about 171 percent in that time period, well below the 300 to 800 percent increase cited by Heilman. We also contacted the Drug Enforcement Administration in Boston and Washington and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. They referred us back to the research center at Ole Miss, which has been monitoring THC content at least since the early 1970s. The researchers there sent us copies of their reports, all published in the journal, along with test results that included the most recent data. We also secured some of their quarterly reports. We found that even though the report Heilman cited didn’t back up her claim, the Ole Miss data did.

That would be 300 percent higher (or four times stronger) than 1992 levels, when the average was 3.08 percent. And it would be 800 percent higher (or nine times stronger) than the average level of 0.98 percent found in 1976. How high could the THC content potentially go? One specimen, seized on Sept. 11, 2007, was found to have a THC content of 37.2 percent. Our ruling Heidi Heilman said, """"Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear."""" Long-term testing shows that, on average, today's marijuana is three times more potent than pre-1993 marijuana and eight times more potent than grass seized in 1976 and earlier.

"While no costs were discussed, the suggestion that the device might be expensive was made: “The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said.” We’ll consider this nod in the direction of cost sufficient for a Satisfactory rating, since it would be difficult to say exactly how much such a device would cost at this stage. Benefits of those who experience the flashing light therapy over those who have the continuous light therapy were described this way: “A series of flashes similar to a camera flash delivered every 10 seconds over a 60-minute period delayed sleepiness by two hours, compared to a 36-minute delay for those exposed to continuous light for an hour.” These quotes were also helpful in quantifying and understanding the benefits: “In essence, using the night before you traveled from California to N.Y. would move your circadian system two-thirds of the way there before you even left,” Zeitzer said. Arriving in New York, you would be synced to the local time after one day, he said. The report indicated there was no harm involved:  “In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality.” This report also indicated helpful additional information from an outside observer, Anna Wirz-Justice, professor emeritus at the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland, who was not part of the new study, who said: “Mistiming light therapy can make jet lag worse.” This report rates satisfactory on the quality of evidence by including cautionary advice from an outside observer saying that independent verification needs to happen: It is “far too early – neither the methodology is available [to] outside research, nor any guidance about safety, nor tests of simulated jet lag in an appropriate ‘realistic’ protocol,”  according to Anna Wirz-Justice. The report included this helpful phrase to indicate that this isn’t a ‘real’ disease: “’Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,’ said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California.” This article scores well on consulting an independent source by quoting a researcher who was not part of the study, Anna Wirz-Justice, professor emeritus at the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland. The study could have made reference to other systematic reviews of therapies used to treat jet lag, such as Cochrane Reviews on caffeine or melatonin. This article made it fairly clear that this technology wasn’t ready for consumers by mentioning that further research needed to happen and that frequent flyers shouldn’t try this on their own. The article is clear that the study is based on substantial theory about the effects of light on circadian rhythms and mentions previous research that the team had carried out, so there is no misleading representation as to the technique’s novelty. Given the helpful comments from an outside (not involved in the study) researcher, we would say the report did not substantially rely on a news release.",0
"""A detail view of the Coffinette for the Viscera of Tutankhamun is shown on display at the """"Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of Pharaohs"""" exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art during a media preview in Los Angeles June 15, 2005. REUTERS/Fred Prouser There has been speculation about the fate of the boy king, who died sometime around 1324 BC probably at age 19, since the 1922 discovery of his intact tomb in Egypt’s Valley of Kings. Tests performed on 16 royal mummies found four, including Tut, had contracted a severe form of malaria that likely cut short Tut’s reign — ruling out murder or some other sickness. Scientists from Egypt, Germany and elsewhere, including Zahi Hawass of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, compiled results from genetic and radiological testing performed on the mummies between 2007 and 2009. The results clarify details about the 155-year-long 18th Dynasty that included Tutankhamen, who inherited the throne at age 11. The scientists speculated Tut was weakened by a broken leg possibly from a fall. That and a malaria infection led to his death, they believe. Tut was afflicted with a cleft palate, mild clubfoot in his left foot and other bone ailments. He and some family members had a form of Kohler disease, which can cause foot bones to collapse from lack of blood but would not have been fatal. “Tutankhamen had multiple disorders, and some of them might have reached the cumulative character of an inflammatory, immune-suppressive — and thus weakening — syndrome. He might be envisioned as a young but frail king who needed canes to walk,” Hawass wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Besides the priceless gold artifacts found in Tut’s tomb, he was also equipped for the afterlife with some 130 canes and staves — some with signs of wear — and a veritable pharmacy. The scientists were also fairly certain they identified the mummies belonging to Tut’s father, Akhenaten, and his grandmother, Tiye, based on shared blood groups. They shot down speculation that Tut and his forebears had severe abnormalities, ruling out Marfan syndrome and another condition that could have led to enlarged breasts. “It is unlikely that either Tutankhamen or Akhenaten actually displayed a significantly bizarre or feminine physique. It is important to note that ancient Egyptian kings typically had themselves and their families represented in an idealized fashion,” Hawass wrote.""",0
"She says the measure was “fake” legalization because marijuana remains prohibited by federal law, and users, including medicinal pot patients and their caregiver, still risk having their lives ruined by prosecution and jail time. But in what appears to be a largely symbolic move of her own, Chippi is now leading an effort to have Nederland, population about 1,500, declared the world’s first “sanctuary” for therapeutic and spiritual consumers of the drug. Based on the “sanctuary city” laws that dozens of U.S. cities used to shield Central and Southern American refugees from deportation in the 1980s, the proposal is likely to go to residents for a vote in the fall. “Just like with immigration policy, we need a place where people can be protected,” said Chippi, speaking in her shop near the foot of the snow-capped Indian Peaks Wilderness. Protecting the spiritual use of cannabis is crucial for the 46-year-old, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Janis Joplin. Several years ago she founded the Closer to the Heart Cannabis Ministry, which she says has more than 300 members who believe marijuana is the Biblical Tree of Life, and that its use is a sacrament. She opened Nederland’s first medical pot dispensary in 2009, and eventually had more than 2,400 patients, she said. But Chippi shut its doors the following year, angered by regulations passed by Colorado lawmakers that she viewed as a “violation of the constitutional rights of sick people.” She has since sued the state six times seeking changes in the rules and greater clarity for users and caregiver. At the same time, she began planning a “sanctuary” ordinance. The proposal, drafted by Denver attorney Danyel Joffe, would prohibit the town from using funds to enforce any marijuana law affecting therapeutic or spiritual uses of cannabis, as long as its use harmed no one else. “I wanted to help them because it’s my belief that cannabis is not an evil weed. There are people who use it for spiritual purposes,” Joffe said. “Yes, some people abuse it, but that doesn’t mean other people should be harmed as a result.”  Nederland, which began life in the 1850s as a trading post where European settlers could do business with local Ute Indians, later turned into a mining town. In more recent decades it became a draw for hippies and those attracted to its quirky, easy-going ambience. This month the town hosted its annual Frozen Dead Guy Days festival, celebrating an effort by a Norwegian immigrant to preserve his grandfather’s corpse. The event features music, beer and events such as coffin races, a polar plunge and frozen salmon tossing. Town Administrator Alisha Reis said the Nederland attorney’s office does not have an opinion on Chippi’s proposed ordinance yet because she has not formally submitted it. “We are planning to process this initiative just like any other,” Reis told Reuters.",0
"Geron did not say why the patients had dropped out of the trial or if the sponsor, the Mayo Clinic, had stopped the study prematurely. Geron said the patients in the study would continue to receive the drug and be monitored according to the study design. Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Brian Klein said the limited information that Geron released in a regulatory filing on Monday could call into question the tolerability and durability of the treatment. “It looks like the therapy for a majority of the patients, or at least a good percentage of the patients, is going to be limited to less than a year,” he told Reuters. The Mayo Clinic had begun the trial for a group of blood cancers, known as myeloid malignancies, in November 2012. “The drug may only be appropriate for patients who have very severe disease,” Klein said. Geron said that data from the 79 patients would be enough to support the drug’s development. The company plans to conduct a mid-stage trial testing the drug, imetelstat, in patients with myelofibrosis - a rare blood disorder - in the first half of the year. Geron said in November that four of the first 18 patients with myelofibrosis enrolled in the Mayo Clinic’s study were free of the disease. Imetelstat is designed to inhibit telomerase, an enzyme that enables rapid multiplication of cancer cells. Geron’s shares were down 18 percent at $4.60 in late-morning trading on the Nasdaq.",0
"Chalk false reports that Jim Morrison has been found living in a Paris retirement community up to a fake news website. Fake news website The Nevada County Scooper started the rumor with a report that appeared under the headline, “Jim Morrison Found Alive in Paris Assisted Living Community.” The report claims that a Paris beat reporter named Belda Sauve broke the story after investigating Morrison’s death for 45 years:  “I was contacted by a nurse from Petites Soeurs des Pauvres, an assisted living hospital for the infirmed,” Ms. Sauvé told the Scooper. “This nurse informed me that she was caring for a patient named Jacques Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The patient, who is suffering fromalcoholism and liver and kidney failure, as well as moderate dementia, told her he was the grandson of the famous French post-impressionist artist, Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec. Everyone believed his story because they knew that the senior Toulouse-Lautrec was a raging alcoholic that cavorted with prostitutes.” “Over time, however, this patient would tell the nurses stories that didn’t seem to fit his originalnarrative. Stories of rock concerts, sexual orgies, and massive alcohol and illegal drug usage. At first, they brushed it off as his dementia talking,” whispered Ms. Sauvé. “One of the nurses, who had read the Morrison biography, No One Here Gets Out Alive, by Danny Sugarman, began to relate the patients stories to those in the biography. Simple addition sent them to me,” exclaimed the proud journalist. “I stopped by the hospital and interviewed Mr. Toulouse-Lautrec. We had great conversations about poetry and art, the Louvre, music, politics, and existentialism. When I mentioned Pamela Courson, Jim Morrison’s soul mate, he retreated within himself and became quiet. I sat there, watching him, silent for more than four hours, working in his brilliant but fragile egg-shell mind. And then he spoke, ‘Strange days have found me here, poisoned by an L.A. woman… waiting for the sun, amongst a feast of friends… lost in a Roman wilderness of pain… the crystal ship is slowly sinking, and the blood in the streets is up to my knees… I am ready to break on through to the other side… I see your pen and paper weave quick minarets… this is the end, my brain is squirming like a toad… Yes, I have taken a face from the ancient gallery…’ The non-sequiturs, that somehow fit, as always, continued to fly for an hour.” The story was quickly shared more than 18,000 times on social media. But The Nevada County Scooper is far from a credible news source, according to its disclaimer: This website is satirical in scope and intent. It provides fake news and social criticism in a satirical setting. If this offends you, you might want to consider doing something else with your time rather than looking at the Internet. Really, the quality of your life will improve dramatically. Our intention is not to fool anyone, but if you do get fooled,  don’t sweat it. Please have fun and lighten up and watch out for Snopes.com. We’re not sure they’ve had all their vaccinations. Questions about Jim Morrison’s death have persisted over the years, but there’s been no conclusive evidence to disprove that Morrison died in a bathtub of heart failure in July 1971. In 2007, a former Paris nightclub manager claimed that Jim Morrison actually died of a heroin overdose in a toilet stall of the club. Two drug dealers dragged Morrison’s body back to his apartment and put him into a bathtub in a last-ditch attempt to revive him, the Associated Press reports. Another theory is that Jim Morrison mistook a pile of heroin for cocaine and died after snorting it. But again, there’s no hard evidence to prove that. No autopsy was performed on Jim Morrison, and Paris prosecutors have said that it’s not likely that a new investigation into his cause of death will be opened. Comments",1
"Farxiga, one of AstraZeneca’s top 10 drugs by sales, is part of the SGLT2-inhibitor class of antidiabetics that cause the kidneys to expel blood sugar from the body through urine. In July, U.S. regulators declined to approve Farxiga as a supplement to insulin in adults with type-1 diabetes where insulin alone was not able to control blood sugar levels. The treatment is already approved in the United States to treat type-2 diabetes, the more common form of the condition. Farxiga competes with rival diabetes drugs, including Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Jardiance and Novo Nordisk’s Victoza.",0
"The world’s No. 1 hamburger chain said on Wednesday it is going to start listing calorie information on menus in some 14,000 U.S. restaurants and drive-throughs - ahead of a national rule that will require larger restaurant chains to make such disclosures. McDonald’s Corp is a trend setter for restaurants and its move in this arena - while prompted by regulations and pressure from public health activists - is likely to force other restaurant operators to follow quickly. The state of California and cities like New York already require that calories be clearly listed on menus. Under the new U.S. healthcare law, restaurants across the country must soon put calorie counts and other nutrition details on menus. The national rules target restaurants with 20 or more locations, as well as other retail food outlets. Most major chains have resisted posting such information, without legislation and the threat of fines. The date for national compliance has been delayed and is not expected to be set until after the U.S. presidential election. McDonald’s was slow to warm to calorie labeling. When labeling proposals were gaining steam several years ago, McDonald’s representatives publicly opposed them. A common complaint was that rules from one jurisdiction to another were inconsistent. Some officials also said calorie disclosures would violate customer privacy. Cindy Goody, senior director of nutrition for McDonald’s USA, described the company’s latest move as a way to help its customers understand their food choices. The company, which is in nearly every U.S. community and serves 25 million U.S. customers daily, is casting the nutrition disclosures as a business opportunity. “It’s a new reason to visit more often,” Goody said. Calorie and other nutrition information already is available on the company’s website. Listing calories on menu boards allows customers to use that information when they are making a decision about what to eat. Margo Wootan, the director of nutrition policy for the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, thinks the national calorie labeling deadline will probably be around the end of 2013 - so customers at McDonald’s will be getting the information about a year earlier than what will be required. Disclosure rules already have helped convince many restaurants, including Starbucks Corp, to cut calories from their food and to highlight healthy options, she said. Those moves matter because Americans get about one-third of their calories from eating out, Wootan said. Amid demands from parents and health activists, McDonald’s also has taken steps to make menu items healthier. It tweaked its popular Happy Meals for children - reducing the french fries portion by more than half and adding apples to every order. This past summer, it rolled out a “Favorites Under 400” menu that highlights products in that calorie range. McDonald’s also plans to add more fresh fruits and vegetables to its menu and has set a goal of decreasing calories, saturated fat and added sugars across its U.S. menu by 2020. Corporate Accountability International has been pressing McDonald’s to make bolder changes to its menus and to stop advertising to children. “To truly address its health impact ... the burger giant (needs) to make more fundamental, far-reaching changes,” said Juliana Shulman, senior organizer for the group’s Value the Meal campaign. More than two years ago, Panera Bread Co became the first national restaurant chain to voluntarily post calories at company-owned stores. Sandwich chain Subway has used calorie disclosures to position itself as a healthier alternative to rivals like McDonald’s and Burger King Worldwide Inc.  McDonald’s shares were down $0.30 at $90.90 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"The story makes no mention of costs, even though the costs of statins are easy to find, and, in Canada, because of the universal health care system, the costs of statins to the government should be an easy number to quantify. All benefits are presented in relative terms, which is misleading to readers. For example, the third sentence says, “Researchers found that people who took statin medications had about a 16% reduced risk of renal failure and a 21% lower risk of dying after their surgeries, compared to people who weren’t taking the drugs.” What are the absolute numbers? Well, out of 67,941 people, 1,208 people suffered an acute kidney injury while not taking statins, and 1,039 suffered one while taking statins. That means 169 fewer people suffered an acute kidney injury, and this is making the big assumption that statins had anything to do with it. No risks or harms from statins are mentioned in this story. Statins are a well tolerated class of drugs with a relatively low risk profile, but all drugs carry risks and have side effects. When you start talking about extending statin use to a much larger percentage of the population, those risks become magnified. We felt that some mention of risks was warranted. There is some good information in here about the basic outlines of the study design. The story says, for example, “For the study, researchers looked at the medical records of all seniors who had elective surgery in Ontario, Canada, from 1995 through 2008, a group of 213,347 men and women over age 65. Elective procedures included heart or lung operations, vascular surgery, or surgery in the abdomen, or procedures on the bladder, ureter, or kidneys — except transplants or removal of the kidneys. About half of patients in the study had heart surgeries. Nearly one-third of these patients were taking statin medications before going under the knife.” What was missing was any sense of the limitation of these findings. The study itself goes on at some length about these limitations, including this crucial piece of information: “As with all observational studies, the protective association seen between statin use and AKI may not be causal.” We also thought it worth noting that to be considered a “statin user,” all one had to do was fill a statin prescription in the previous 90 days. Given that someone could have filled a statin prescription on Monday and had surgery on Friday, we don’t think this is a strong enough basis to prove that statins protected kidneys from failing. We don’t think the story intended to engage in disease-mongering, but the story is framed in such a way that the risk of renal failure following surgery is overly hyped. The second sentence of the story says, “For reasons doctors don’t completely understand, this complication, which is called acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute renal failure, is on the rise, and it dramatically increases a patient’s risk of dying during recovery.” It isn’t until later in the story that we are told, “Overall, about 2% of patients experienced renal failure within two weeks of their procedures.” That should ease patients’ concerns a bit until later in the story it says, “Depending on how researchers define it, studies have shown that it may occur in up to 40% of patients.” This sort of whipsawing can turn readers off to a topic and leave them feeling scared and confused. There are no independent sources quoted in this story. There was nothing in the story about current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure. This leads readers to believe that there is nothing they can do to prevent a renal injury or death other than take statins. Statins are such a widely prescribed class of drug that we feel most readers will understand their availability. The story does hint at this by noting that one-third of the patients who had surgery in this study were taking statins. The story, like the study, points out that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals. We think the story makes it clear to readers that what’s new and important here is showing a relationship in humans as well. The story does not rely solely on a news release, but we do think the story relied too heavily on the study’s abstract. It should have gone deeper into the story to provide readers context.",1
"No officer has been arrested or charged in connection with  the shootings, and a judicial commission set up to investigate  has provided no updates on its progress. The incident was one of the deadliest environmental protests in India in a decade. A working group of United Nations’ human rights experts last May condemned the “apparent excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force by police”. India’s National Human Rights Commission has dropped its inquiry, citing “adequate compensation” paid to victims and attempts by the state to restore law and order, according to a document reviewed by Reuters. At the same time, people surrounding the Vedanta Ltd smelter, since shuttered by the state authorities for allegedly poisoning groundwater, say they are still being intimidated by local police. The company has consistently denied the pollution allegations. Some residents allege they have been detained and beaten by the police, and that they have been refused the right to protest. One activist, S Mugilan, who released a video critical of the police shootings, has been missing since Feb. 15 – the day he held a news conference in state capital Chennai. “People have been intimidated and forced into silence by the police,” said 79-year-old A W D Thilak, the head of the Thoothukudi Bar Association. “This is not real peace, there has been no compromise,” he said. Local police say that all their actions since the shootings have been aimed at keeping the lid on any potential trouble, even if that means curbing some rights to freedom of speech or protest. However, they denied allegations of abuse by officers. Police shot at the protesters without warning on May 22, 2018, according to interviews with multiple witnesses at the time. On that day and on May 23, 12 people were killed with shots to the head and chest, half of them from behind, according to a Reuters analysis of post-mortem reports in December. Another protester died after being allegedly beaten by the police, according to family members. Police said at the time they were overwhelmed and had opened fire because they feared the protesters were about to attack people in government offices and apartments housing Vedanta workers. The Madras High Court in August asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Indian equivalent of the FBI, to file charges within four months. Nine months later, no action has been taken. A senior CBI official declined to comment on why no charges have been filed. A CBI spokesperson did not respond to a request seeking comment. The Judicial Commission declined to comment. The National Human Rights Commission did not respond to a request seeking comment. Meanwhile, Vedanta executives have been pushing to restart the smelter, which was run by its Sterlite subsidiary, with social media postings under hashtags such as #knowthetruth and #reopenSterlite. The smelter was shuttered by a Tamil Nadu government order soon after the killings. The company, which is controlled by the billionaire Anil Agarwal, has said it regretted the shootings occurred and has consistently denied the plant polluted its surroundings. Vedanta did not respond to specific queries on its executives campaigning for reopening its smelter, but said in a statement it had a “strong track record” of corporate social responsibility interventions. The statement listed community schemes it was currently funding, including a plan to plant a million trees and a drinking water project. Santhosh Raj, a 22-year-old protester who witnessed the death of the first man shot that day, said that in mid-January he was abruptly blocked by men on motorbikes who dragged him by his collar and forced him into a jeep, where he was blindfolded. “They started hitting, from all sides. My back hurts even today,” Santhosh told Reuters at his residence in Pandarampatti, a village on the outskirts of Thoothukudi. He said he was switched to a different vehicle and taken to an unknown location where his blindfold was briefly removed so that police could take his photograph. The officers made him sign a document, though he does not know what was in it. Santhosh says police threatened to kill him for campaigning against the smelter’s reopening, and says he was subject to beatings throughout the day. Murali Ramba, the superintendent of police in the Thoothukudi district, said Santhosh had been arrested because he was instigating protests and disrupting law and order. He denied that Santhosh had been abused or threatened. Local residents say the police are clamping down on any attempts to discuss the shootings or the plant shutdown. When villagers hoisted black flags on their terraces in a protest, police seized the flags, the residents said. “If anybody wants to provoke or instigate, the police will not allow it,” Ramba said. The Madras High Court ruled last week that a gathering of up to 500 people would be allowed to mark the anniversary of the shootings on Wednesday. That was despite opposition by the city’s government and the police, who said it could disrupt law and order. In the days and weeks following the protest, local police detained 277 people, mostly aged between 18 to 30, though they were all subsequently released following a court order. The families of the 13 people killed received 2 million rupees ($28,430) each in compensation, according to Sandeep Nanduri, the district’s top administrative official. None of the families are known to have hired a lawyer to seek more, though the Madras High court said in an order in August that the CBI could decide to award higher compensation if it thinks it is warranted following an investigation. Many of those killed, injured or arrested came from  villages around the plant, which is about 10 km (6 miles) from the center of the city. It has meant losses of income, hurting local businesses, and disrupted education. Some have been unable to take up jobs abroad because they face charges. People seeking justice are still being picked up by police, said Hari Raghavan, an activist lawyer. The police “summon people without paying heed to basic things like giving them time to ask for leave from their employer”, said Raghavan, who was himself detained for protesting against Santhosh’s disappearance.",0
"The additional cost of adding fish and seafood to the diet aren’t discussed. There aren’t benefits to quantify, only results, but the news release reports even those in confusing fashion. It states in the second paragraph that “marine-based omega-3s are eight times more effective at inhibiting tumor development and growth” without giving any sort of baseline for what’s being measured. Further down it states that “exposure to marine-based omega-3s reduced the size of the tumors by 60 to 70 percent and the number of tumors by 30 percent” without saying how much omega-3s the mice consumed or giving the sizes or frequency of tumors. Also, there’s no data on how many mice died. The Cochrane Collaboration (a non-profit that researches and reports on evidence-based medicine) looked at many different human studies and says that so far there is no proof fish oil can treat or prevent cancer-related weight loss, depression, dementia and many other conditions. Some fatty and farm fish contain significant levels of mercury, PCBs, and other contaminants and experts recommend limiting their consumption and avoiding them entirely if you’re pregnant. That isn’t mentioned. The release also conveys an endorsement of fish oil tablets, which can have side effects such as heartburn, nosebleeds, hot flushes, leg cramps, nausea and bad breath. Not until the fifth paragraph does this news release mention that this is a study of mice with an unusual form of breast cancer, not healthy humans. It doesn’t explain how those limit the usefulness of the results. The news release states that the HER-2 form of breast cancer “affects 25 percent of women.” That number seems over-inflated according to other sources. The Mayo Clinic website states “in about 1 of every 5 breast cancers, the cancer cells have a gene mutation that makes an excess of the HER2 protein.” And Cancer Investigation journal put the number of women with HER-2 positive at 19% for women under 49 years and 15% for those over 50 years old. Funding sources and conflicts of interest aren’t mentioned. According to the study, which is behind a paywall, funding came from the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research-Institute of Cancer Research, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the Ontario Research Fund, Ontario Graduate Scholarship. Canada is a world leader in both seafood and flax seed exports. The authors reported no competing interests. The news release doesn’t mention evidence-backed strategies to reduce breast cancer risk such as limiting alcohol consumption and getting exercise. Fatty fish is widely available. The news release notes in the seventh paragraph that it’s the first to compare the impact of different omega-3s on breast cancer tumor growth in mice. The news release gives premature medical advice to “choose omega-3s from fish over flax for cancer prevention” and “consume two to three servings of fish a week,” and suggests without evidence that “omega-3s will likely be beneficial for other types of cancer.” It veers even further astray by conveying a researcher’s view that “supplements and functional foods, such as omega-3 eggs or DHA milk, can offer similar cancer prevention effects.”",1
"The story doesn’t discuss the cost of fried fish, but we think this is common knowledge. Not applicable in this case. Not applicable.

The story was based on an observational study and the story was appropriately cautious about any causal link. We love the analysis provided by independent experts: “This is good stuff.

You’re looking at a community and seeing how it’s behaving on the whole,” says Daniel Labovitz, a stroke neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. “This study can’t tell you causation. It can’t tell you there’s a direct link between one thing and another, it just tells you they’re associated,” says stroke neurologist Victor Urrutia, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. How might eating fried fish impact stroke? It could be that frying the fish leaches out the omega-3s, says Jeremy Lanford, stroke director at Scott & White Healthcare in Roundrock, Texas. Or the increased fat calorie content from the frying oil may contribute to stroke, says author Nahab. He also notes that fish used for frying, such as cod and haddock, tend to be the types lower in healthy fats. More research is needed to tease out whether cooking methods affect stroke risk, Labovitz says. “In other words, is fried fish a problem, or is it another red herring?” he says. No disease mongering of stroke, and especially not about the concern in the “stroke belt.” The independent experts quoted made the story complete. Terrific analysis of the evidence by the independent experts. A helpful sidebar included this information about alternative sources of omega-3 fatty acids: There isn’t any question about the availability of fried fish, especially in the regions in question. The story explained that this study is “part of a large government-funded study, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS).” It’s clear that the story didn’t rely on a news release.",0
"On Aug. 8, 2019, a Facebook user posted an account of her three dogs’ apparent deaths from algae poisoning, stating that the dogs “contracted blue-green algae poisoning and there was nothing they could do”:  Blue-green algae — cyanobacteria to the scientific community — are a massive, diverse, and ancient group of bacterial species ubiquitous in nature. Massive blooms can occur in environments when significant amounts of nutrients, either from fertilizer or other natural processes, run off into waterways, producing conditions that allow the organisms to overwhelm a body of water. Though not all species of cyanobacteria produce toxins, “species within several genera produce potent toxins, known as cyanotoxins […] all of which can induce severe or fatal illness in animals and people,” according to a review paper published in the scientific journal Toxins. Though equally susceptible to toxic effects of these cyanotoxins, humans are less likely to suffer deadly consequences because they generally do not drink large amounts of algae-contaminated water or roll around in it. Val Beasley, a professor of veterinary, wildlife and ecological toxicology sciences at Pennsylvania State University, told The New York Times that cyanobacterial poisoning of animals is common and occurs seasonally: It happens every single year in the U.S. and around the world. … A lot of times, the neurotoxins will kill the animal before they can get to the veterinarian. … This time of year is when you have the most numbers of cases and people are out and about with their animals and the conditions are ripe for the cyanobacteria to grow.",0
"""On Feb. 23, 2010, the Republican Governors Association -- the gubernatorial campaign arm of the national GOP -- fired a shot at Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida. The RGA, which is backing Republican Bill McCollum, took aim at Sink's career as a top executive at Bank of America and its predecessor in Florida, NationsBank.Here's the entire text of the 15-second advertisement, to be aired on broadcast and cable television outlets:""""As bank president, Alex Sink eliminated thousands of Florida jobs while taking over $8 million in salary and bonuses. Alex Sink. Not one of us. One of them. """"In a fundraising e-mail sent several hours after the ad was launched, the Sink campaign attacked it as """"full of dodges and distortions"""" and said it """"misleads Floridians about Alex Sink's record as a business leader."""" We see three questions to probe here. One is whether her banks eliminated """"thousands of Florida jobs"""" on Sink's watch. The second is whether the ad correctly describes Sink's compensation. And the third is whether it's fair to lay the blame for the job losses on Sink.We'll take these questions individually.Job lossesWe were unable to track down any official NationsBank documents addressing the issue of job losses from the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's August 1997 acquisition of Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank. But news coverage at the time is consistent in reporting that the company planned to eliminate 6,000 jobs as a result of the merger.A Jan. 1, 1998, Miami Herald article quotes Rusty Rainey, who led the NationsBank-Barnett transition, saying that the merger would cut more than 6,000 jobs. Before the merger, the Herald reported, Barnett employed about 22,000 people and NationsBank had between 8,500 and 9,000 employees in Florida.It's worth noting that the 6,000 figure involves a bit of uncertainty. It's a prediction, rather than an after-the-fact accounting, so the final number may have been higher or lower. (In other reports, the Herald noted that new jobs might be created in back-office processing facilities in Jacksonville and with the expected addition of 60 to 80 supermarket branches.) In addition, Rainey said in the Herald article that the 6,000 target would be met largely by attrition rather than layoffs -- not an implausible goal, given the high rates of employee turnover in the banking industry and the relatively low unemployment levels at the time.Also, the subsequent merger of NationsBank with Bank of America in 1998 created an expected 8,000 job cuts. But that was a national number; the number of jobs lost in Florida specifically was not reported.Ultimately, none of these caveats matter much because the RGA ad was carefully worded. It speaks of """"thousands of Florida jobs,"""" rather than citing a specific number of job losses, and it refrains from describing the eliminated jobs as """"layoffs."""" So we find this description accurate. CompensationHere too, we were unable to obtain original tax forms from the Sink campaign, but their contents were widely and consistently reported in 2002, when the gubernatorial campaign of Sink's husband, Democrat Bill McBride, released them to the public.The McBride campaign released Sink's tax returns for 2000 and 2001, which had been filed independently of her husband. Earlier, the campaign had released the couple's jointly filed return from 1999.When her income from these three years is combined, Sink earned in excess of $8 million. According to various news reports at the time, which were based directly on the tax returns released to the media, Sink earned $2.6 million in 1999, $3.4 million in 2000 and $2.8 million in 2001. (She took early retirement in a management shakeup in 2000.) That equals $8.8 million over three years. While that amount squares with the dollar figure cited in the ad, it's worth noting two caveats.One is that this income was earned between two and four years after the merger was announced. However, Sink held the same position at the time -- president of Florida operations for the bank -- and was presiding over the merged entity. So that doesn't strike us as being a major flaw.The other caveat concerns the ad's use of the term """"salary and bonuses."""" In 2002, the Associated Press reported that Sink's 2000 income included """"stock-options and lump-sum pension payments"""" and that her 2001 income included """"stock options, deferred compensation and pension"""" payments. None of the coverage mentions """"bonus"""" payments, and the campaign was not able to clarify whether she received any bonuses or not for those years. The RGA stands behind its characterization. """"To most normal people, any compensation that is over and above your typical salary would be called a bonus,"""" said spokesman Tim Murtaugh. """"Very often, these bonuses take the form of some combination of stocks and other compensation. """"But we think the distinction is worth mentioning because in today's post-Wall Street crash environment, saying that a financial-services employee received a lucrative """"bonus"""" at the same time the company was cutting jobs is a pretty loaded accusation. Absent any hard evidence that she received what experts would consider a """"bonus,"""" we'll downgrade the accuracy of this part of the ad slightly.Who's to blame?So our analysis suggests that the core facts in the ad are pretty accurate. But what about the larger context? Two banking experts noted that Sink did nothing unusual compared to other bank executives during that period of aggressive mergers. Stanley D. Smith, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida, said that the elimination of those jobs in the merger """"would have and should have occurred no matter who the Florida CEO was. That merger was what is called an intramarket merger, where the two banks’ branches and operations overlapped. The premium that NationsBank paid was based on the savings that would occur from the elimination of overlapping branches and operations. Any competent banker would have done the same thing, and those unfortunate job losses are just a normal part of that type of merger. """"James McNulty, a finance professor at Florida Atlantic University, agreed. """"Bank mergers very often involve job losses,"""" he said. """"The major reason that banks merge is to improve efficiency, and that involves eliminating positions that are redundant in the combined organization. In many cases jobs are reduced by attrition rather than by firing people -- those who leave are not replaced, and good people that the bank wants to retain are moved to new positions. This happens in most large bank mergers. Blaming it on Alex Sink is preposterous. """"There's one other issue worth considering: Was Sink as personally responsible for slashing jobs as the ad claims?Last May, Sink told reporters in the St. Petersburg Times-Miami Herald Tallahassee bureau that the decision to merge with Barnett was made by corporate executives at NationsBank headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. """"I got a call one day just like the people at Barnett did that said an agreement has been reached,"""" she said.Murtaugh of the RGA responds that """"Sink was the president of the bank. Of course she was responsible for decisions made. If she says she wasn’t responsible and was only following orders, what does that say about her ability to tout her business experience? She can’t claim that she wasn’t in charge of decisionmaking and then also claim that she has business decisionmaking experience. """"On that point, we agree. Even if she were not the architect of the deal, she helped implement the merger over the next few years, and received a generous compensation package at the same time. With the exception of the term """"bonus,"""" which we think is a bit of a stretch, the RGA ad strikes us as generally accurate.""",0
"""Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio has been called a lot of things over his 12 terms in Congress -- hot head, visionary, renegade, principled, effective and determined. Now, if a burst of activity on websites and blogs in recent weeks is to be believed, DeFazio is something else -- a socialist. And he’s not alone. The posts, all of which piggyback from a single offering that has been replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks, says there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives, including Rep. Earl Blumenauer, another Democrat from Oregon. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70 while others insist it’s either 73 or 76. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.) An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name. It also says this: """"I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse."""" """"This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one,""""  says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. """"The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth."""" In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem. While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention here at PolitiFact Oregon. Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too. Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth:  """"The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’."""" Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And we couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte. Before we get to our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office. Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as """"card carrying"""" socialists who are no longer serving include: Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii). Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members, including DeFazio and Blumenauer, aren’t Socialists. The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon """"is completely fraudulent,"""" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5. There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away. Second, Llewellyn said, """"if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues. For the record, both DeFazio and Blumenauer say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America. """"This is another made-up Internet rumor that has no merit,"""" DeFazio said. """"I am a proud Democrat who has taken many independent stands over the years. I am anti-so called free trade, pro-American jobs, pro-infrastructure investment, pro-fair taxation, anti-amnesty, pro-balanced budget amendment, pro-Wall Street re-regulation, and pro-audit the Pentagon and Federal Reserve. I am an Oregonian and an independent thinker."""" Blumenauer was equally annoyed. """"No matter which side of the political aisle it comes from, this kind of name calling and rhetoric represents exactly what is wrong with our democracy today,"""" he said. """"Rather than bringing people together to solve our nation's problems, it spreads false and divisive allegations throughout the media and the public. It is a major distraction from the real work that needs to get done."""" Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from? The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two:  Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA? A: Seventy  It then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but officially, not a single socialist. According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus. Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist. Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created. """"There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. """"I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it."""" Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false.""",1
"No treatments exist yet. Since there are no treatments yet, this criterion is not applicable. Near the end of the story, a paragraph states that successful treatments are not guaranteed, and that the safety of using the cells in humans has not been proven. The paragraph mentions the possiblity that cancer may be a side effect, and that the most promising type of stem cells have not been shown to develop fully into their original counterparts. This information comes late, but it is satisfactory. The story does an excellent job of describing the history and current status of stem cell research. Readers understand that the evidence of any benefit is preliminary and knowledge still developing. The story generates emotion and sense of urgency by describing how Douglas Melton’s children, who have Type 1 diabetes, could benefit from treatments that may grow out of his research. But Melton does appear to be motivated in part by his children’s stories, and there are many other people in the same situation, hoping for clinical stem cell treatments. In this case, using those anecdotes to frame the piece is not inappropriate. The author quotes four sources, including the subject of the story. All are experts in the field who are familiar with Melton’s and others’ research. All of the sources have some interest in positive outcomes of the research, either personal, professional, political or [presumably] financial. The author should have indicated this. It would have been useful to have the voice of someone who is more skeptical about the safety and imminence of stem cell therapies, but overall the sourcing is satisfactory. The story says that Type 1 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease, two targets of stem cell therapies under development, do not have cures. Because the story is not about the treatments, however, it is not necessary to discuss how these patients are currently treated. The story focuses on basic stem cell research conducted in vitro and in animals. It makes clear that clinical applications are not available. It mentions that the FDA has just approved the first small trial of stem cells in patients with severe spinal cord injuries. The story’s detailed history and context allow a reader to appreciate what aspects of stem cell research are new and novel. It is clear that this article did not rely on a news release.",0
"""Not applicable. The cost of watermelon is not in question. The story only reported that """"researchers found that eating six grams of watermelon extract a day for six weeks lowered blood pressure in all nine middle-aged subjects with prehypertension."""" It didn’t say by how much. Was it a difference of159/99 down to, say, 120/80? Exactly how much of a difference in both systolic and diastolic pressures did it make? We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt for at least mentioning that the researchers """"reported no adverse effects."""" Even if there had been any, though, there’s a good chance they may not have shown up in just 9 people. There is no discussion of the limitations of drawing any conclusions from a study of just 9 people. The story mentions """"pilot"""" and """"preliminary"""" but doesn’t tell the reader anything about the limitations therein. The story states that """"Approximately 60 percent of U.S. adults are prehypertensive or hypertensive."""" No source is cited for that estimate. More importantly, there is no discussion of concerns about the labeling of """"prehypertension"""" as a disease. It’s not difficult to find criticism – even from other journalists such as Ray Moynihan, in a recent issue of the journal BMJ. Excerpt: It also allowed one of the researchers to say """"Cardiovascular disease [CVD] continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. Generally, Americans have been more concerned about their blood cholesterol levels and dietary cholesterol intakes than their overall cardiovascular health risk factors leading to CVD, such as obesity and vascular dysfunction characterized by arterial stiffening and thickness –– issues that functional foods such as watermelon can help to mitigate."""" But this story didn’t investigate any evidence about arterial stiffening and thickness. And it was not about all cardiovascular disease. It was about 9 people with """"pre-hypertension."""" There were no independent sources in the story. The story also failed to disclose that the researchers are supported by grants from the National Watermelon Promotional Board. There was no discussion of any other methods that might be used or have been researched to lower levels of so-called """"pre-hypertension."""" Not applicable. The availability of watermelon is not in question. We’ll again give the story the benefit of the doubt for explaining that there had been some prior research: """"While watermelon or watermelon extract is the best natural source for L-citrulline, it is also available in the synthetic form in pills, which Figueroa used in a previous study of younger, male subjects."""" But it didn’t tell readers whether any of these findings had been confirmed by any other independent research team(s).

"The release doesn’t address cost at all. The release makes clear that the blood test is not ready for clinical use, stating that researchers “hope it will be commercially available within the next five years.” However, if the release is going to discuss what such a diagnostic tool would look like (e.g., “mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot”), it should also provide a ballpark figure on what such a diagnostic tool might cost. The release tells readers that the study correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries 94 percent of the time, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood corresponded to the severity of the injuries. However, the release emphasizes only one side of the biomarker story, focusing entirely on the positive predictive value. While important, we think that the other side of the coin should have been addressed as well. Another presumed benefit of an easy-to-use biomarker blood test to detect concussion would be eliminating the necessity of a CT scan if, in fact, the biomarker had a high negative predictive value. The study notes a 98% negative predictive value. That means if the test comes back negative, there is a very low likelihood that the person has suffered a concussion. This could eliminate the need for a CT scan and any additional treatments. In reality, it is unlikely that a positive test would obviate the need for a CT scan. In fact, one could argue that the presence of a positive result would require a CT scan. The 94% accuracy notation in the press release is incorrect. It should have noted a 94% sensitivity (true positive) and a 47% specificity (true negative). The low specificity means that many positive results will be wrong (see more below under “Harms”). The release is silent on the potential harms that could result from an easy-to-use biomarker test, especially one that has a 47% specificity (the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the condition). A test with only 47% specificity means that more than half of positive results will be “false positives.” The release does not address these “false positives” at all — meaning instances in which the test diagnosed a patient as having brain injury when there was no injury. A false positive could result in additional testing, which may create a financial burden, and — in the case of a CT scan — poses health risks of its own. Second, the release refers to the possibility of using the blood test to make brain injury diagnoses “on the spot.” Quoting one of the researchers who did the study, the release says: “The idea is to get a point-of-care test that could be used on the field to help the coaches, the trainers and the athletic directors, make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play.” However, the journal article the release is reporting on notes that GFAP is detectable in the bloodstream “within one hour of injury.” The release does note that such a tool should only be used to “help” adults make decisions about a child’s health, but this still raises some significant questions. What if a coach, for example, takes a blood test before the GFAP has had time to become detectable in the blood stream? Would that give the coach a false sense of confidence that the child is fine and can re-enter the game? The release does not provide many important aspects of the study, The release says that researchers performed CT scans on 152 children and compared the results of those scans with results from the blood test. In fact, the study was of 257 children, of which 197 had blunt head trauma and 60 were trauma controls. Of the 152 children who received CT scans, 18 were found to have traumatic intracranial lesions. That means that 1-out-of 11 of the children scanned has evidence of a concussion. So the results in the story are really only based on 18 children out of the 152 with presumed traumatic head injury. The study authors note in the paper that “a much larger number of children will be required to test the precision of the biomarker.” No disease mongering here. The release notes that the journal article’s lead author receives funding from NIH. The study itself was partially funded by the NIH, a subtle but potentially important distinction. Further, the journal article notes that the lead author is a scientific consultant for Banyan Biomarkers, Inc. — a company that has intellectual property rights to GFAP testing. The journal article also states that the relevant author “receives no stocks or royalties from the company and will not benefit financially from this publication” — but that potential conflict of interest is still worth mentioning in the release. The story provides information on the routine use of CT scanning as the standard for traumatic head injury. Since there are a host of biomarkers under study at the present time to detect concussion, we would have liked to have seen a couple of words on the other research taking place. For example, Banyan Biomarkers has one additional biomarker under study at the present time. The release makes clear that the GFAP test is not available for clinical use, and that the researchers hope to develop a test for clinical applications within the next five years. There is a robust body of literature on GFAP and brain injury, but the release does not mention that research at all. The journal article notes that “To the best of our knowledge this is among the largest published studies to date assessing GFAP in children and youth with mild and moderate [traumatic brain injury] in an [emergency department] setting.” That’s useful context, and the release should have included it. Even better, it could have told readers how this research fits into that existing body of work — is it consistent with previous findings? Does it expand on previous findings? That would be great to know. The release calls the test “simple” in several places whereas our review shows that it would be anything but. Some other examples of hyperbole: “Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test,” “Blood test is 94 percent reliable in detecting concussions in kids, confirmed by CT scans.”  The story backs off in the last line that states “Researchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.”  That’s not quite good enough, however. In the published results, the authors stated more appropriately, “Further study is required to validate these findings before clinical application.”",1
"""A Texas meat processor who questions a government-approved bait that kills feral hogs charges there’s no public research on the product. Will Herring, owner of the Hubbard-based Wild Boar Meat Company, which makes hog meat into pet food, has said he fears the product’s active ingredient--warfarin, long known as a rat poison and human blood thinner--will damage his business. Also, Herring said: """"There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs,"""" a comment we spotted in a March 6, 2017, news story in the San Antonio Express-News. A note: Public studies of particular pesticides don’t appear to be mandatory. An Environmental Protection Agency web page about registering pesticides says only that the """"company that wants to produce the pesticide must provide data from studies  that comply with our testing guidelines"""" without mention of whether the studies must be public or, say, conducted independently. That web page also says that before registering a product, EPA develops risk assessments evaluating the potential harms to humans, wildlife, fish, and plants, including endangered species and non-target organisms plus any possible contamination of surface water or groundwater from leaching, runoff and """"spray drift."""" Still, Herring persuaded a state district judge to issue a temporary order putting a hold on state rules approving Kaput’s use by state-licensed pesticide applicators and state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, filed a proposal barring the state from registering any lethal pesticide, including warfarin, for feral hog control unless a state agency or university performs and publishes a scientific study weighing the pesticide’s environmental and economic effects. Both moves happened after Sid Miller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, announced the Texas Department of Agriculture would issue rules limiting Kaput’s sale and use to licensed individuals. When we inquired, the state agency emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that Colorado-based Scimetrics, the company poised to vend Kaput, fielded $136,854 in research grants from TDA from 2013 into 2017. All told in 2016-17, the sheet indicates, the agency awarded $802,500 to fight feral hogs; that counts funds awarded to counties, universities and other agencies. Feral hogs can be fearsome nuisances. Nationally, as many as 750,000 are harvested annually, yet how they ravage rural and suburban lands remains a problem--and Texas is home to more than 2 million of them. No public study? We asked Herring how he reached his conclusion about no public studies. By phone, he told us that he didn’t find specific studies of the product in online searches nor, he said, did Genesis Laboratories, the Colorado-based company that developed the product, provide a study at his firm's inquiry. We also reached Richard Poché, Genesis Labs' president, who conceded that no Kaput study has been formally published. He said, though, the company completed a study in Texas in 2015 submitted under the title """"Field efficacy of a warfarin bait used to control feral hog populations"""" for consideration by the Wiley-published Wildlife Society Bulletin, which describes itself as a journal for wildlife practitioners that effectively integrates cutting-edge science with management and conservation, and also covers important policy issues, particularly those that focus on the integration of science and policy. By email, the bulletin’s editor, Kansas State University’s David Haukos, confirmed that study was submitted. In March 2017, Haukos told us: """"The manuscript is currently undergoing peer-review; therefore, no decision has been made concerning publication."""" Poché said by phone the 2015 study was followed up by another in 2016 with a third study underway in 2017, each one based on feeding the Kaput product to feral hogs. Both of the first two studies, he said, decimated exposed hog populations in North Texas study areas; he noted too the bait uses only one-fifth of the warfarin found in conventional rat and mouse baits. We asked for a copy of the 2015 study. By email, Poché said that remains """"confidential business information,"""" and that releasing it before publication would leave his company with no control of where it ends up. Poché otherwise provided two of his own March 2017 PowerPoint presentations on Kaput along with the printed program for the April 2016 International Wild Pig Conference program in Myrtle Beach, S.C. A section of the program, """"Feral hog control using a new bait,"""" evidently describes a Scimetric study. It opens: """"An EPA Experimental Use Permit was obtained to conduct a field trial using a novel bait to control feral hogs. The product, 12-years under development, was used to determine the efficacy against feral hogs on test sites 50 miles east of Plainview, Texas. Two paraffin bait formulations were tested, containing 0.005% and 0.01% warfarin. Hog activity was monitored pre- and post-treatment using trail cameras near feeders, VHF and GPS transmitting equipment, and bait consumption."""" Next, the summary says: """"Bait was applied in modified commercial feeders with heavy lids. Baiting initiated on June 1 and terminated June 30, 2015. After the 30-day exposure period efficacy on the 5-km treatment plot baited with 0.005% warfarin was 100%, 98.6%, and 97.8% using radio-tracking, trail camera images, and bait consumption. Efficacy on the 0.01% warfarin bait plot was not as effective. Ninety-seven non-target searches were conducted during the treatment and post-treatment phases to examine for mortality, for which none were found,"""" an indication other animals weren’t killed by the bait. The text closes: """"The low warfarin concentrate bait proved effective in eliminating wild hogs while posing minimal exposure to non-target wildlife."""" The longer of the PowerPoint presentations includes a slide stating that warfarin was approved as a rodent-killer in 1948 and as a human drug six years later. The presentation also has several slides titled: """"Field Efficacy of a Feral Hog Bait Containing 0.005% Warfarin,"""" with a subtitle indicating the slides refer to research in North Texas from 2015 into 2017. Images include feral hogs wearing GPS collars or tagged for tracking by radio. One slide summarizes the research results by different methods of making hog counts:          SOURCE: Presentation, """"Where we’ve been and where we’re going with Warfarin for controlling wild pigs,"""" March 1, 2017, Richard Poché, Genesis Labs (received by email from Poché, March 9, 2017) Company: No independent research ‘necessary’ Poché, asked if independent research makes sense before Kaput goes commercial, emailed: """"Not necessary. We do research under what is called Good Laboratory Practices, which is required by the EPA. No one can match the quality and integrity of the work."""" According to an EPA web page, the agency conducts audits to ensure companies developing pesticide products comply with those practices. EPA registration Our search of EPA’s web site led us to a Jan. 3, 2017, agency document indicating that on Jan. 3, 2017, Kaput Feral Hog Bait was registered with the agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. """"Registration is in no way to be construed as an endorsement or recommendation of this product by the Agency,"""" the document further states. """"In order to protect health and the environment, the Administrator, on his motion, may at any time suspend or cancel the registration of a pesticide in accordance with the Act."""" Also, the document says, the product is """"conditionally registered"""" in accord with section 3(c)(7)(a) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; the section says the EPA administrator may conditionally register a pesticide if the pesticide is """"identical or substantially similar"""" to a registered pesticide and approving the registration wouldn’t """"significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment."""" Another agency web page says: """"If EPA finds that the pesticide meets the standard for registration, but there are outstanding data requirements, the Agency may, under certain circumstances, grant a ‘conditional’ registration pursuant to FIFRA section 3(c)(7). However, before granting a conditional registration, EPA must determine that, although an application lacks some of the required data, use of the pesticide would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on people or the environment during the time needed to generate the necessary data."""" We asked Poché about """"outstanding data requirements"""" with Kaput, as mentioned generally by the EPA. By email, Poché said a """"1-year storage stability study"""" for Kaput has been submitted to the EPA. Poché unpacked: """"An EPA-registered pesticide requires stability of the chemical in the formula available to the public. The product is stored in the marketing container on the shelf at room temperature over a one-year period. The bait is analyzed every 3 months for the warfarin concentration. That analysis is done at the beginning and at 3, 5, 9, and 12 months after manufacturing. The goal is to ensure the bait is good after 1 year and the concentration of warfarin is plus or minus 10% of what the EPA label requires. In our case the concentrations were within 1% of the label requirements,"""" Poché said. Over a couple days, we did not draw an EPA response to Herring’s claim. Otherwise the National Pesticide Information Center, which partners Oregon State University with the EPA, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a 1991 EPA """"fact sheet"""" on warfarin that states the EPA evaluates pesticides by obtaining from producers a """"complete set of studies showing the human health and environmental effects of each pesticide. The Agency imposes any regulatory controls that are needed to effectively manage each pesticide's risks,"""" the sheet says. State intends limits Miller, the state agriculture commissioner, is a former legislator who authored the Texas law enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs from helicopters. At the TDA, spokeswoman Jennifer Dorsett responded to our inquiry about the absence of public studies of Kaput. Dorsett said by email: """"Kaput is an entirely proprietary product, so studies on the Kaput Feral Hog Bait are owned by the company and you would have to contact them directly to see if they will release them to you."""" Also by email, TDA spokesman Mark Loeffler stressed that while the state agency helped fund Kaput research, its role is generally limited to cataloging pesticides approved by EPA, including Kaput, though Miller applied his authority to make Kaput """"state limited use,"""" to be sold by licensed dealers and used by licensed applicators, Loeffler said. """"We do not do state-paid studies of proposed pesticides,"""" Loeffler wrote. """"We are not required to do lengthy study of a product because we have little discretion to reject or deny"""" registrations, he said. Dorsett otherwise provided a document listing a dozen reports on poisoning feral hogs, issued from 1987 through 2002, including seven titles specifying """"warfarin,"""" we tallied. Dorsett said the agency’s toxicologist, Michael Hare, used the reports as references in evaluating Kaput as a state-limited-use pesticide. Dorsett told us relevant research also has involved the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, which says it has officials in nearly every county demonstrating """"the latest technology and best practices to improve the state’s food and fiber system."""" We didn't hear back from the service. Loeffler added that Miller has personally drawn on a 1995 post about warfarin’s history as a rat poison and its toxicity to animals put out by universities teamed in the Extension Toxicology Network. Excerpt: """"Warfarin is only slightly dangerous to humans and domestic animals when used as directed, but care must be taken with young pigs, which are especially susceptible."""" Also, the post says, warfarin--which is insoluble in water--poses no threat to aquatic organisms and is """"practically non-toxic"""" to game birds, with chickens """"relatively resistant."""" Our ruling Herring said there’s no public study of Kaput, the product that might soon be available in Texas to attack feral hogs. There’s no public study of that EPA-registered product, we confirmed. But a 2015 study submitted to a science journal would become public if it’s accepted for publication. Also, the effects on feral hogs of warfarin, Kaput’s active ingredient, has been explored in published studies. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""",0
"""Echoing the U.S. House speaker, Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin charged President Barack Obama with disregarding many of his own statements by declaring the government would stop deporting millions of unauthorized residents. At a Dec. 2, 2014, hearing, McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson: """"The president said over 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to do this, to take this executive action, and that this is not how democracy works. Do you agree with that prior statement?"""" Johnson replied: """"Mr. Chairman, I know from 30 years as a lawyer that when someone paraphrases remarks from somebody, I want to see the full Q-and-A, I want to see the full context to know exactly what the person said. I have looked at various excerpts of remarks by the president concerning his legal authority to act. I do not believe that what we have done is inconsistent with that."""" Shortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found False the Democratic president’s statement that his position hadn’t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a """"deferred action"""" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here. So, Obama used to say his ability to take action ended at deferring action against children of unauthorized residents. But he lately has been saying there were additional things he could and would do. In his Nov. 20, 2014, announcement touching off Republican objections, Obama said he would delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If an applicant can pass a background check and pay a fee, he or she could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which is expected to open for applications this spring. It’s one thing for Obama to attempt revisionist history. But is McCaul right that the president previously forswore his authority to act – and more than 20 times? Boehner’s Obama breakdown By email, McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen pointed out a Nov. 19, 2014, blog post by the Republican House speaker, John Boehner, stating Obama had said 22 times he couldn’t ignore or create his own immigration law. We explored each of Boehner’s citations by establishing what Obama said from original source materials including transcripts and news stories. Upshot: About 15 of the tallied Obama statements suggest Obama didn’t think he had the power to do more on immigration by himself, hence backing up McCaul’s statement. We’ll summarize those statements in this story and greater detail lies in the document here. However, around half a dozen of Boehner’s examples showed Obama saying or hinting otherwise about his executive powers or not talking about his independent ability to affect immigrants. Times Obama was silent or signaled he did have power For instance, Boehner brought up two Obama statements from when he was running for president in 2008 and criticizing """"signing statements"""" like ones employed by President George W. Bush to interpret legislation signed into law; neither of these items showed Obama bringing up immigration. On July 1, 2010, Obama laid out his hopes Congress would reach an immigration law overhaul. In his remarks, he recognized """"there are those in the immigrants’ rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are (here) illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. And often this argument is framed in moral terms: Why should we punish people who are just trying to earn a living?"""" Obama said such an action would be """"unwise and unfair,"""" but he didn’t address whether he thought he had the power to take such action. Boehner’s list also folded in Obama’s reply at an October 2010 MTV/BET event about his position on the military’s since-eclipsed policy of """"don’t ask, don’t tell."""" """"I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there,"""" Obama said. But immigration was not part of his reply while to another question, Obama stressed border security and otherwise urged a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws. Boehner also listed Obama’s remarks at an April 2011 event. In that instance, though, the president focused on his desire for bipartisan immigration reform – and didn’t speak explicitly to his executive powers. """"I can't solve this problem by myself,"""" Obama said,adding: """"We're going to have to change the laws in Congress."""" At a September 2011 White House roundtable, Obama was asked about granting """"administrative relief"""" enabling students lacking legal residency to stay in the country. His answer seemed to indicate he saw wiggle room for the administration, which makes sense given the soon-to-debut deferred-action mandate. Obama initially said: """"I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true."""" But, he went on, """"what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources."""" In a July 2013 Univision interview, which we found excerpted in an NPR news story, Obama was asked if, in the event Congress failed to pass immigration legislation, he could use his power to give amnesty to the estimated 11 million unauthorized U.S. residents. His answer left wiggle room. """"Probably not,"""" Obama replied. """"I think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus."""" A more recent Obama quotation offered by Boehner seemingly contradicts McCaul’s statement. In August 2014, Obama indicated to reporters that he might have room to act on his own. In the face of no congressional movement on immigration legislation, Obama said, """"what I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress. And we’re going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you the American people don’t want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done."""" Times Obama said he couldn’t do more on immigration alone Let’s turn next to Obama statements, from Boehner’s list, that seem to support McCaul’s claim that Obama didn’t think he had independent legal authority to act on immigration -- some made before the deferred-action directive came out. In October 2010, Obama told Eddie """"Piolin"""" Sotelo, a radio host on Spanish-speaking Univision, that he couldn’t achieve comprehensive immigration reform without congressional action. """"I am president, I am not king,"""" Obama said. """"...I’m committed to making it happen, but I’ve got to have some partners to do it."""" At a Univision event in March 2011, Obama was asked if he could stop deportations of students with an order. That’s """"just not the case,"""" Obama said, """"because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed... Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws."""" Simply issuing such an order, he said, """"would not conform with my appropriate role as president."""" Yet he also hinted at wiggle room, saying: """"That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity. In an April 2011 speech in Miami and the next month in El Paso, Obama said he couldn’t bypass Congress and change immigration laws himself, saying that’s not how a democracy works. Addressing the National Council of La Raza in July 2011, Obama drew exhortations to act without waiting for congressional agreement. He called that idea """"tempting,"""" then said """"that's not how our system works."""" In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that """"as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,"""" as in parents deported. At a presidential debate the next month, Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney were asked: """"What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?"""" Obama said: """"I've done everything that I can on my own."""" In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had aided law-abiding students. """"I’m not a king,"""" Obama replied, tracking his response the same month to a similar query from Univision and his reply at a February 2013 Google Hangout town hall where he also said """"we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can."""" The same year, Obama was asked by Telemundo if he would consider freezing deportations of the parents of students benefiting from the administration’s 2012 action. Obama replied that if he broadened his protective orders, """"then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option."""" We confirmed similar hitches on Obama’s part in a November 2013 speech in in San Francisco and a March 2014 Univision interview. See more detail on these presidential statements in our document here. White House response By email, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded to our query about McCaul’s claim by pointing out a Nov. 19, 2014, memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president’s 2014 actions fit within the government’s discretionary powers. The office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. Our ruling McCaul said Obama """"said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority to"""" act as he did on immigration. The Texan’s count is too high – we see less than 15 solid examples from 2010 into 2014 – but his statement is spot-on about Obama often saying he couldn’t do more absent congressional action.""",0
"The “Asbestos in Talc Symposium,” sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration, was dominated by industry hands: Most of the 21 non-government participants had done work for talc companies, such as testing and serving as expert witnesses and consultants, symposium documents and other records show. Key sessions were led by witnesses for Johnson & Johnson in lawsuits alleging the company failed to warn customers that its Baby Powder was tainted with cancer-causing asbestos, the records show. Others who sought invitations were turned away, including a physician who had testified against J&J in trials that resulted in billions of dollars in damage awards against the company. History was repeating itself. Over the past 50 years, the FDA has relied upon - and often deferred to - industry even as outside experts and consumers repeatedly raised serious health concerns about talc powders and cosmetics, a Reuters investigation found. Again and again since at least the 1970s, the agency has downplayed the risk of asbestos contamination and declined to issue warnings or impose safety standards, according to documents produced in court proceedings and in response to public records requests. The agency said it lacks the authority to require manufacturers to test for asbestos in talc or report any results. And it seldom has ordered its own tests - until recently. Amid heightened scrutiny in Congress, a criminal investigation of J&J and costly jury verdicts against the company, the regulator commissioned tests that found asbestos in 11 talc-based cosmetics, including Johnson’s Baby Powder. J&J recalled 33,000 bottles. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois congressman who chairs a U.S. House subcommittee investigating talc safety, told Reuters it was time for regulators to stop relying on manufacturers’ safety assurances. “When something as serious as cancer or carcinogens are at issue,” Krishnamoorthi said, “self-regulation doesn’t make a lot of sense.”  In written responses to questions from Reuters, the FDA said its resources and authority to regulate the cosmetic industry are limited. The agency said it has no power to ensure the safety of cosmetics before they are put on store shelves, nor to force companies to pull them off when potential hazards are discovered. “We are dependent on manufacturers to take steps to ensure the safety of their products,” the FDA said after announcing a voluntary recall of tainted cosmetics in March. FDA officials declined to comment on the decisions of former employees over the years, saying only that the agency relies on the best information available and that studies “have improved our understanding of how and why asbestos fibers are hazardous.”  The agency said it now recognizes, as the World Health Organization and other public health agencies did years ago, that there is no known safe level of asbestos. FDA officials said their current policy is to act swiftly - and if necessary encourage recalls - even when small amounts are discovered. The regulator has stood by its recent tests of Johnson’s Baby Powder, despite pushback from the company. J&J, the world’s largest producer of talc powders, said in a statement that it recalled the 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder out of an “abundance of caution.” Eleven days later, the company announced that tests by labs it hired had determined that there was no asbestos - other than some contamination it said came from an air conditioner - in samples from the one bottle tested by the FDA and the batch it came from. In written responses to Reuters, J&J said it systematically tests its talc and has always found its powders to be safe and pure. “Throughout the 1970s and ‘80s, the FDA and other regulatory bodies defended talc,” J&J’s Chief Executive Alex Gorsky testified in an Oct. 3 deposition. “FDA agreed overall with the position that we had taken with the safety of our talc.”  The company told Reuters that it “has long cooperated (with) and supported the FDA in its mission to protect the public health,” and that any suggestion it has unduly influenced the agency to reduce regulation or standards is “just false.”  The FDA now is under increasing pressure to ensure talc powders and cosmetics are free from asbestos. The agency’s testing of talc-based cosmetics this year followed jury verdicts totaling more than $5 billion against J&J in cancer lawsuits, as well as a Dec. 14 Reuters report showing that J&J knew its raw talc and powders sometimes tested positive for asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s and did not report those findings to the agency. J&J has disputed the Reuters report as “one-sided, false and inflammatory.”  In the wake of the Reuters report, the company announced it was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to people familiar with the matter, these include a criminal grand jury probe into how forthright J&J has been about the safety of its powders. The FDA began looking into talc safety in 1971 after researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York found what appeared to be asbestos in unnamed brands of talc powder. Two years later, FDA records show, the agency found asbestos in a sample of Shower to Shower, a J&J powder at the time that was made with the same talc as Johnson’s Baby Powder. The FDA never publicly announced the finding. J&J told Reuters the result was not final, citing findings in an FDA table issued in 1976. But that table, reviewed by Reuters, is ambiguous, listing no result for the type of asbestos found in 1973. J&J told Reuters the gap means no asbestos was found. Assured by J&J and other manufacturers that their talc was safe, the FDA eventually ended its inquiry without taking action because “the potential hazard did not warrant a recall,” Heinz J. Eiermann, a former J&J researcher who at the time ran the agency’s cosmetics division, wrote in a March 1976 memo. That same year, J&J, other talc companies and their trade group, the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association, persuaded FDA officials that manufacturers could monitor the safety of their own products, according to records J&J and the group produced in litigation. The FDA dropped plans to impose testing and purity standards for talc powders and cosmetics. The trade group published its own test, which was voluntary for companies to use. The written standard for that test acknowledges that it cannot detect most types of asbestos at low levels, nor one common type - chrysotile - at all. In a statement to Reuters, the trade group said it believed that chrysotile was not commonly linked to talc used in cosmetics. Chrysotile is the type of asbestos the FDA-commissioned test found in Baby Powder this year. It also was found in several tests conducted by labs for J&J on its talc from 1972 through 2003, according to records produced in litigation. J&J has said that some of the tests were on industrial talc and that others, on Baby Powder talc, reflected background contamination. Asbestos is a loose term for a group of six minerals that readily separate into needles or fibers. Easily inhaled, they are known to cause lung, ovarian and other types of cancer. While most people exposed never get cancer, for some even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease. Just how small has not been established. Talc safety concerns resurfaced in 1983 when a graduate  student scouring geology journals for a toxicology class came across information he considered disturbing: Talc deposits are commonly laced with asbestos, a similar mineral. Philippe Douillet immediately thought of the talc powder his sister used on her baby, he recalled in an interview with Reuters. He urged her to stop using it. Then he petitioned the FDA to require an asbestos warning on talc powders. “It was really obvious to me there was a big issue there,” said Douillet, who now runs a biotechnology company in Miami. When the FDA began evaluating Douillet’s petition, it looked to J&J for key information, agency records show. The FDA’s June 1985 risk assessment relied upon a decade-old letter from the company for the agency’s estimate of the amount of dust babies were exposed to during diapering. That 1974 letter from J&J to the FDA said that, hypothetically, even if babies were exposed to talc powder with as much as 1% asbestos, it would be a far lower concentration than allowed at the time for industrial workers. J&J told Reuters in a statement that “at no point has Johnson & Johnson taken the position that it would consider talc containing 1% asbestos appropriate for sale to consumers.”   In the end, the FDA decided there was no need for an asbestos warning on talc powders. In a July 1986 letter to Douillet, acting associate FDA commissioner J.W. Swanson wrote that the quality of cosmetic talc had improved “and that even when asbestos was present, the levels were so low that no health hazard existed.”  What’s more, Swanson wrote, agency officials had come to question earlier reported findings of asbestos in talc powders. Those doubts, he wrote, were based in part on a paper published in the proceedings of a 1977 scientific conference. Both of the paper’s authors had worked for J&J, one as an asbestos testing contractor and the other as its longtime talc supply manager. The authors argued that some testing methods were apt to misidentify microscopic lookalike rock splinters as asbestos. The industry’s test, the paper said, was designed to avoid this confusion. Other U.S. and European public health authorities have come to regard such splinters as presumptive toxins because of their similarity to asbestos. The FDA defended its 1986 decision to reject Douillet’s petition. In a statement, it said the graduate student “did not provide persuasive evidence that the cosmetic talc produced at the time contained significant amounts of asbestos minerals.”  Eight years later, the regulator received a new request for a warning label on talc powders. This one came from Dr. Samuel Epstein, a University of Illinois environmental medicine professor who chaired the Cancer Prevention Coalition, an advocacy group. Epstein’s 1994 petition didn’t concern asbestos. It raised the possibility that talc, by itself, was a hazard worthy of a warning label. His petition was based on research showing that talc, when used as an antiperspirant and deodorant in underwear, was associated with ovarian cancer. In a brief July 1995 letter, FDA acting cosmetics chief John Bailey told Epstein’s coalition that the agency had taken no action because it had other priorities. Bailey told Reuters in a statement that he issued this “interim” response because the petition lacked scientific support. In 2002, having taken no action on the petition, Bailey moved to the cosmetic trade group, now known as Personal Care Products Council. The council considered him a “key employee” because of his “former employment with the FDA,” according to a tax filing by the group. Now a consultant, Bailey serves as a litigation expert witness to J&J and other talc companies. In his statement to Reuters, Bailey said he had been hired at the council “as a scientist responsible for applying sound science to decision making.” He disputed Reuters’ finding that the FDA deferred to industry, saying the agency takes potential health concerns seriously and does its own evaluations. In 2006, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified use of talc powder in the perineum area - the pelvic region between the legs - as “possibly carcinogenic.” Two years later, Illinois medical scientist Epstein filed a second petition to the FDA seeking a cancer warning label on talc products. J&J went to work to defeat it. In a May 2008 email to colleagues, J&J executive Kathleen K. Wille wrote: “Our response could be a potential source of data and information on which the FDA can base their response.”  Together, J&J, its talc supplier and the Personal Care Products Council arranged for a pair of scientists to assess the published studies that linked talc and ovarian cancer, according to emails and other records produced in litigation. The scientists concluded that the evidence was too weak to consider talc as a cause. At a May 2009 meeting, Bailey, Wille and other industry representatives briefed FDA officials on the assessment, according to a meeting memo produced in litigation by J&J’s talc supplier. Three days later, Wille told colleagues in an email, “We have every confidence that the FDA will dismiss this petition once they have reviewed our submission.”  J&J told Reuters in a statement that the company had been confident because it believed the agency would be swayed by science, which it said supported J&J’s position that talc does not cause ovarian cancer. Before the FDA ruled on the warning requests, however, concerns about asbestos contamination flared again. This time, the FDA’s South Korean counterpart reported finding asbestos in talc powders. Acting on that 2009 report, the FDA commissioned talc tests for the first time in 40 years, hiring Maryland-based AMA Analytical Services Inc, which analyzed 34 samples of talc powders and cosmetics, including Johnson’s Baby Powder. It found no asbestos in any of them. The lab had no experience testing for asbestos in talc. Its prior work focused on building materials such as vinyl flooring, according to the deposition testimony of AMA lab director Andreas Saldivar. The FDA has said Saldivar’s lab used “the most sensitive techniques available” but cautioned that the results were limited to the 34 talc powders and cosmetics tested. The testing had other limitations as well. Saldivar’s lab looked at less talc per sample than other labs that have found asbestos in talc powders. And it did its work in a fraction of the time typical for such analyses, according to a Reuters review of the lab report and interviews with experts who test talc for asbestos. Saldivar’s lab was recently rehired by the FDA. This time, it found the asbestos that led to the first recall of J&J’s iconic Baby Powder. Saldivar declined to comment. In the first verdict of its kind, a South Dakota jury found in October 2013 that J&J had a duty to warn women that research had linked its talc powder to ovarian cancer. No damages were awarded. Then the FDA weighed in on the issue. In April 2014, 20 years after Epstein first contacted the agency, the FDA rejected both of his petitions for warning labels. Its announcement said the science wasn’t strong enough to support a cancer warning, echoing the assessment J&J and its industry partners had presented to the agency in 2009. In court, such arguments have not always proved convincing. In early 2016, a Missouri jury concluded J&J’s powders caused a woman’s ovarian cancer death and awarded her survivors $72 million. An appellate court later set that verdict aside, ruling that the woman had filed her suit in the wrong state. In the aftermath, the FDA asked J&J for “safety literature and data regarding talc,” correspondence shows. The company submitted a report saying no asbestos had “ever been found during any testing” of its talc. Since then, lawsuits have compelled J&J to produce internal documents that show the company knew its talc and powders had tested positive for asbestos on occasion for decades. The company now faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging that its powders caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, an incurable cancer. The vast majority are awaiting trial. In court, there have been mixed verdicts, mistrials and some appellate rulings in J&J’s favor. Last year, in response to renewed asbestos concerns, FDA cosmetics chief Dr Linda Katz began organizing the November 2018 symposium and a public hearing on talc testing, now planned for next year. She reached out to J&J for help. J&J vice president Jethro Ekuta responded by sending Katz a letter in June 2018 recommending a list of three talc testing experts. All three had served as defense witnesses or consultants for J&J. Two of the experts Ekuta recommended, as well as a third J&J defense witness, led sessions at the closed-door “Asbestos in Talc Symposium” on Nov. 28, 2018. None of the sessions were led by medical experts who had questioned the safety of talc powders and cosmetics. J&J said that apart from recommending experts, it did not advise the FDA on the symposium. Ekuta, who has left J&J, declined to comment. In a statement to Reuters, the FDA downplayed its role in the symposium, saying the event was “hosted” by the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN), a research group co-founded by the FDA. “No formal or regulatory recommendations were expected or made,” the agency said. In fact, records show, the FDA initiated and paid for the meeting, set the agenda and chose the participants. The meeting set the stage for formal recommendations on how to test products used every day by millions of people. The FDA said a government committee tasked with proposing a standard test for asbestos in talc powders and cosmetics is “continuing to work through issues discussed at the JIFSAN symposium.”  Many FDA meetings are held in public and invite comment. Details on the talc symposium were hard to come by, however, even after it was over. The FDA declined Reuters’ requests to provide a list of participants or any information on what transpired. After Reuters filed a public records request with JIFSAN, the research group posted meeting information online and released planning emails. The guest list showed that more than half of the 54 participants were employed by or recently retired from FDA and other agencies. Of the 21 non-government participants, 17 had either worked for talc companies, done lab testing or served as expert witnesses for the industry, Reuters found. Five of the participants affiliated with talc companies also have served as expert witnesses for plaintiffs. Most of the non-government participants were experts in geology or minerals testing. In a statement, the FDA said it would ordinarily avoid having sessions led by defense or plaintiff witnesses. However, the agency said there are a “limited number of experts worldwide with scientific knowledge” on asbestos testing, standards and results analysis. Not everyone was welcome. Among those turned away was Dr. David Egilman, a clinical professor of family medicine at Brown University. He testified last year in a trial that ended in a $4.69 billion verdict for women alleging J&J’s talc powders caused their ovarian cancers. Egilman told Reuters he was concerned that if the FDA was guided by geologists and industry consultants, it might overlook fundamental questions about which mineral fibers cause cancer. He wanted to offer his expertise, as a physician and researcher, on what technicians should look for under the microscope. Testing hinges “on the determination of what particles or elements should be tested for,” he wrote in a November 2018 email to organizers asking to be included in the symposium. “This is a medical question and not a technical question.”  Katz took a different view. In an email forwarded to Egilman, she said: “This meeting is not intended to discuss health-related issues or concerns.”  She met with Egilman later. Katz also told Egilman that the symposium was not intended to reach any consensus. At its conclusion, however, session leaders, including three who have served as defense witnesses for J&J, drafted what they called “consensus” or “concurrence” reports. Two of the reports reviewed by Reuters embraced industry positions on what fibers should be counted as hazardous, an issue of fierce contention in courtrooms across the country. The reports discouraged counting fibers that may or may not be asbestos, saying that doing so might exaggerate the hazard. That view runs contrary to the positions of other U.S. and European public health officials, who presume mineral fibers that even look like asbestos are toxic. As Arnold Brody, a professor emeritus at Tulane University Medical School, told jurors in a talc powder trial last year, “The lung doesn’t care” what it’s called. These issues are likely to be aired at the public hearing the FDA said it is planning for next year. The gathering could signal how the agency intends to navigate between industry and consumer interests in coming years. Krishnamoorthi, the congressman heading the House investigation into talc safety, said the agency needs to bring consumers and their advocates into the discussion. “In light of the public interest around this particular issue,” he said, “we need to find out what’s going on.”",0
"In April 2017, rumors appeared on social media that former United States President Barack Obama had been arrested in Japan in connection with large quantities of cocaine purportedly found on his yacht:    The arrest rumor appeared to have originated via a 31 March 2017 blog post from Benjamin Fulford (who days earlier had claimed that the Japanese government was trying to kill him) that was further aggregated by other dubious web sites: Former US President Barack Obama, in custody of the US military police, has informed on his drug dealing bosses, according to sources in Japanese military intelligence. As a result of this, an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines was impounded at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean, the sources say. The money raised from this drug flight was intended to be used to finance the operations of Daesh (formerly known as ISIS), the sources say. This impoundment follows the capture of an Obama linked ship containing 4.2 tons of cocaine, the sources note. At the bottom of the post was a citation referencing a 15 March 2017 post on conspiracy site WhatDoesItMean.com about Barack Obama’s supposedly fleeing the scene of a drug bust that took place in the Caribbean on a “fishing vessel named the Lady Michelle” that was linked to the former president:  Obama Flees After Massive Drug Bust Aboard Lady Michelle Vessel In Caribbean An intriguing Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that former President Barack Obama fled Washington D.C. this past Friday (10 March) traveling to New York City, Omaha (Nebraska), San Jose (California) and ending up in Hawaii — all occurring within 36 hours while he sought elite allies to defend him, and keeping him ahead of investigators from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Department of the Treasury (DoT) seeking to interview him about one of the largest drug busts in American history occurring in the Caribbean aboard a fishing vessel named the Lady Michelle. 4.2 tons of seized cocaine, worth an estimated $125 million, from the President Barack Obama linked fishing vessel named Lady Michelle on 16 February 2017 According to this report, nearly immediately upon taking office as President Donald Trump’s Attorney General on 9 February, Jeff Sessions, as head of the US Department of Justice (DOJ), was handed a top secret file by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey detailing the nearly two-decade long crimes of 12 current and former security and intelligence officers belonging to the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) who for at least 18 years under both the Bush and Obama regimes had smuggled into the United States at least $100 million worth of cocaine. None this was true, as the “Obama drug bust” story originated with the WhatDoesItMean.com is a fake news conspiracy site, described by RationalWiki as follows: Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of “reports” published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don’t think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don’t contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. The image used to illustrate the WhatDoesItMean article was taken from an earlier news report about a 16 February 2017 U.S. Coast Guard drug bust off the coast of Suriname that had nothing to do with Barack Obama or Japan:  The U.S. Coast Guard busted four men suspected of smuggling more than four tons of cocaine worth $125 million in the Atlantic Ocean. Officials said on Feb. 16 they intercepted a suspicious fishing boat off Paramaribo, Suriname. The 70-foot vessel was allegedly carrying numerous bales of cocaine, the Coast Guard said. Officials seized 4.2 tons of the drugs, worth an estimated $125 million in wholesale value.",1
"""National conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, mindful of a federal law that stepped up the required efficiency of light bulbs, recently aired her qualms about the compact fluorescent light bulbs offered to consumers as more efficient alternatives to traditional incandescent bulbs. In a column included in a Feb. 2 e-mail blast by the Texas Eagle Forum, the founder of the national Eagle Forum said: """"CFL bulbs do not work well in colder temperatures, and most cannot handle dimmer switches; broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks."""" We’ve previously looked into CFL-related claims, so we know there are variations on this theme. For this article, we’re spotlighting Schlafly’s health claim, that broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks. Seeking illumination, we requested elaboration from the person who sent the e-mail blast, Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle Forum. Meantime, we found what looked like Schlafly’s original column, posted online Dec. 21 at WorldNetDaily.com. From the site, we also asked Schlafly for back-up information. Next, we searched online for news stories on CFLs touching off migraines and epileptic episodes. Google led us to an opinion column by Nicolas Loris, a research associate for the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. In the column, posted online Nov. 10 by the Sacramento Bee, Loris writes: """"Hospitals and medical charities warn that CFL bulbs cause migraines and epilepsy attacks."""" Loris told us by e-mail that his source was a November 2009 article published by a British newspaper, The Daily Mail, which quotes """"medical charities"""" saying they have been swamped with complaints that the """"flicker of compact fluorescent bulbs can trigger migraines and epilepsy attacks."""" The article continues: """"The charities are lobbying the (national) government to allow an ‘opt out’ for people with health problems so they can continue to use the older bulbs."""" Stating that about one in 10 people suffers from migraines, the article quotes Lee Tomkins, of the Migraine Action Association, recommending that residents stockpile conventional bulbs and advising people who suffer from migraines to avoid using fluorescent bulbs as reading lights, or in living areas and kitchens. Phew. Who knew? No one in the United States, it initially appeared. With help from the American Academy of Neurology, we reached a national expert on each affliction. Per migraines, Stephen Silberstein, a professor of neurology at the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said a light flickering at a certain frequency can aggravate a headache. But, Silberstein said, there is no evidence that CFLs cause migraines. """"This is bull,"""" he said. Marc Nuwer, a professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said strobe lights--such as those in discotheques--can flicker at a rate that would touch off a seizure in about 1 in 200 people. However, Nower said, CFL bulbs flicker at much higher rates not detectable by the human eye; they don’t cause epileptic seizures. Nuwer speculated: """"Someone is talking about some theoretical far-fetched possibility that a broken light would flash"""" at the 10 times per second that can cause seizures among a few. """"Even then, that’s really different from a strobe light, which is really bright, lighting up a room."""" Nuwer said his online searches for scientific literature connecting CFLs to epileptic seizures or migraines came up empty. On our behalf, though, he contacted Graham Harding, an international expert on photo-sensitive epilepsy, a form of the disorder in which seizures are triggered by visual stimuli. In e-mails to Nuwer, Harding said that among 174 respondents to an online survey by Epilepsy Action, 4 percent -- seven people -- reported epileptic seizures due to CFL bulbs, and 4 percent due to conventional fluorescent lights, compared to less than 1 percent due to conventional incandescent bulbs. Harding’s e-mail says the 4 percent reporting problems with CFLs referred to the lights flashing on start-up or because the bulbs were faulty. Harding’s e-mail closes: """"So the risk (of induced seizures) is no greater than with normal fluorescent but is more than ordinary filament light bulbs."""" All that said, he continued, since conventional bulbs have been phased out, with fluorescents presumably replacing many of them, the United Kingdom’s Epilepsy Action group has not reported any seizure problems to him. Nuwer also passed along a comment from Robert Fisher, a Stanford University neurologist and director of the Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Fisher said by e-mail that fluorescent lights in the United States and Europe flicker at a higher frequency """"than would be likely to provoke photosensitive seizures."""" But a """"defective light may flicker at a lower frequency"""" and such flickering """"can and has caused seizures in a few susceptible individuals... So it could happen, but it would be expected to be a rare occurrence."""" Next, we interviewed Mark Rea, director of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Lighting Research Center, who said he’s seen no U.S. study demonstrating headaches or epileptic attacks occur because of CFLs. He noted, though, that a 1989 study completed in Great Britain compared the incidence of headaches in an office under different kinds of fluorescent lighting. According to that study, the incidence of eye strain and headaches were cut in half when high-frequency lights were used. Finally, we came across a paper on CFLs’ impact on health adopted by the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks in September 2008. The paper says: """"There is no scientific evidence that fluorescent lamps including CFL(s) induce (epileptic) seizures."""" While flickering light in general can induce migraines, the paper says, scientific """"support for aggravating symptoms by flicker from fluorescent tubes was not found."""" Similarly, while there’s """"evidence showing that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy,"""" the paper says, """" there are no reported effects of CFL having such effects."""" Meanwhile, the Texas Eagle Forum’s Carlson relayed a defense of Schlafly’s statement from Schlafly’s son, John. Schlafly pointed out that his mother’s use of the word """"allegedly"""" signaled that she was """"not claiming she had scientific proof CFLs cause migraines or epilepsy. However, it is a fact that some people who suffer from migraines or epilepsy believe that CFLs cause or aggravate those painful and debilitating conditions, he said. Our take: Flickering lights of various origins have been linked to migraines and epileptic seizures. But there appears to be no scientific evidence that CFLs, broken or otherwise, cause either disorder.""",1
"The problem of gun crime in the United States, and in particular mass shootings in schools and other public places, has defied universally accepted solutions for the past couple of decades. One common proposition, particularly popular among conservatives, is that the primary cause of such shootings is a disintegration of traditional morality and Christian values in the United States. That viewpoint found its way into a Texas U.S. Senate election debate in September 2018, when incumbent Republican senator Ted Cruz argued that “removing God from the public square” and “losing the moral foundation of much of our society” were partly to blame for school shootings: Let me say, as the father of two daughters, there is something deeply wrong that we have these shootings. There are a lot of things behind it that have nothing to do with government. They have things to do with things like removing God from the public square, like losing the moral foundation of much of our society, like losing the binds of community and family. On Twitter, John Rehling criticized what he perceived as Cruz’s argument, offering some comparative statistics on religious affiliation and gun crime in Japan and the state of Texas: Ted Cruz said that school shootings take place because we removed “God from the public square.” Texas is 93% Christian and has a fatal school shooting every year. Japan is 2% Christian and has never had a school shooting. Worst theory ever Ted Cruz said that school shootings take place because we removed “God from the public square.” Texas is 93% Christian and has a fatal school shooting every year. Japan is 2% Christian and has never had a school shooting. Worst theory ever.#TXSenateDebate — JRehling (@JRehling) September 22, 2018  Rehling’s tweet was later reposted by the pro-science Facebook page Skepticus, garnering further exposure for his claims:  The numbers included in Rehling’s tweet were very accurate (although not perfectly so), and the best evidence we found in some instances actually offered stronger support for his overall argument: Christians do indeed make up a large majority of residents of Texas, where on average even more than one fatal school shooting takes place every year. Christians likely make up even less than two percent of the population in Japan, which has no recorded instance of a fatal school shooting, and which has a rate of gun death more than 500 times lower than that seen in the United States. “93 percent Christian” This number appears to be a slight exaggeration, but Rehling’s broader point, that Texas is  overwhelmingly Christian, still stands. According to the Pew Research Center’s 2014 “Religious Landscape Study,” 77 percent of Texans identified as Christian, with evangelical Protestants (31 percent) and Catholics (23 percent) making up the bulk of that contingent. This rate of Christian affiliation ranked joint seventh-highest in the United States. (Louisiana had the highest at 86 percent, and Vermont the lowest at 54 percent.) “A fatal school shooting every year” No official government database tracks shootings that take place in schools or colleges in the United States, so it’s not possible to arrive at a definitive number, but the rate mentioned by Rehling for Texas (one fatal school shooting per year) appears to be a slight underestimation. Perhaps the most reliable and comprehensive unofficial source of data on school shootings is the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which defines a school shooting as “an incident that occurs on property of the elementary, secondary or college campus where there is a death or injury from gunfire.” According to GVA data, Texas experience: So between January 2015 and October 2018, an average of 2.5 fatal school shootings took place in Texas per year, leading to an average of five deaths per year (although the latter figure is heavily skewed by the May 2018 Santa Fe high school shooting, in which 10 people were killed). If one limits the numbers to only include fatal shootings in elementary, middle, and high schools, seven such incidents were recorded between 2015 and 2018, leaving an average of 1.75 shootings per year. Another comprehensive database is the one maintained by Everytown for Gun Safety. Although Everytown is not impartial on the issue of gun violence (they advocate for stricter gun control laws), their database contains good references and sourcing for every such incident, and it also records shootings at colleges as well as elementary and high schools. According to Everytown, Texas schools experienced: Based on those figures, an average of exactly one fatal school shooting per year took place between 2013 and 2018, with an average of 2.5 deaths per year. If one includes suicides, two fatal school shootings occurred per year between 2013 and 2018, accounting for 3.7 deaths per year. Although methodologies and figures vary, Rehling’s claim of “a fatal school shooting every year” in Texas appears to be a very conservative estimate, and likely a significant understatement. Our determination, based on the reliable data sources we consulted, actually provides greater support for Rehling’s broader argument. “2% Christian” This figure actually appears to be a somewhat generous estimate of the prevalence of Christianity in Japanese society. According to the Pew Research Center’s “Global Religious Landscape” study, 1.6 percent of people in Japan identified as Christians in 2010. A November 2017 Pew Research Center presentation cited two sources which gave even lower estimates. According to the University of Michigan’s Japanese General Social Survey, 0.7 percent of Japanese people identified as Christians in 2015, and according to Japanese government research from 2015 the figure was 1.5 percent. Although Rehling’s figure of “2% Christian” appears to be a slight overstatement, our determination once again actually offers greater support to his broader argument. “Has never had a school shooting” We could find no record of a shooting (fatal or otherwise) having taken place at a school or university in Japan in recent memory. Rehling’s assessment is accurate: what is a frequent phenomenon in the United States, including Texas, simply does not happen in Japan. On the whole, Japan has among the lowest rates of gun crime in the developed world. For example, the rate of gun deaths per 100,000 people was 0.02 in Japan in 2014, according to GunPolicy.org, a research initiative run by the University of Sydney, Australia. In the United States, the gun death rate was 10.54 in 2014, a figure that’s more than 500 times higher. A 2016 article on the Japan Times news website asked “What are the chances of a mass shooting in Japan?” and outlined the strict laws and procedures surrounding gun ownership there: In Japan, citizens are banned from possessing, carrying, selling or buying handguns or rifles. Importing gun parts is also prohibited under the Firearm and Sword Control Law. Only licensed hunters are allowed to own shotguns, and the screening process is very strict. Applicants are required to obtain a license from a local government and undergo background checks by police as well as mental and drug tests at hospitals. The gun license must be renewed every three years, and applicants are required to again undergo the various tests.",0
"The original Associated Press story mentions the cost of of Pneumovax $30, and the original AP story also had questions about cost effectiveness of vaccinating younger, otherwise healthy college-age smokers. But both points were cut out in the version published by the NY Daily News. The story does not mention the number of adult smokers under age 65 who would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of pneumonia. There was little data on this point in the source material, which the story should have noted. The original AP story mentions that the vaccine may not be very effective and may be considered overtreatment in otherwise healthy younger smokers. But the NY Daily News cut out that part in what it published. Neither version mentioned potential side effects of the vaccine, which might include pain if adminstered via the muscle, and allergic reaction, though this is rare. The story does not provide any quantitative evidence on which the new vaccination recommendations were based; however, there are no publicly-available data provided by the CDC or ACIP to report. The story fails to note this lack of evidence, or question experts on this point. The story does note that smokers are four times more likely to develop pneumonia than non-smokers of the same age. The story mentions mortality from pneumonia infections in adults over 65 and notes that death from pneumonia is younger people–even smokers– is relatively rare. The story could have done a better job with sources. In the original AP story there were two sources quoted, one of whom works for the CDC which issued the recommendations, and the other is independent. But the NY Daily News cut out the independent source interview. The story might have included a pulmonologist not on the recommending panel, or at a primary care physician, to give perspective on the current evidence and clinical implications of vaccinating 31 million adult smokers while providing smoking cessation counseling. The original AP story discussed the inefficacy of the vaccine in younger people and mentions that there is no booster available, even though protection drops off after 5-10 years. But the NY Daily News deleted that section. The story does not mention how smoking cessation counseling will be administered with vaccine. The story also mentions deaths from pneumonia in those over 65, but we are not told how pneumonia is typically treated in this population and in younger people, or in smokers in particular. We don’t know how many smokers need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of invasive infection; we don’t know how many cases will be prevented by adopting this new strategy. This uncertainty is not made clear in this article. The story explains that the vaccination is already in use for people over age 65. Recommended pneumonia vaccinations in older adults and those with compromised immune and respiratory systems is not new. The story focused on new recommendations that all adult smokers be vaccinated. There isn’t any evidence that the story relied solely or largely on a news release.",1
"There was no discussion of the cost of this device (or the cost of a test using the device). One news release put the cost at “less than $15,000.” The news release stated the results “show the device accurately indicated reduced electrical activity in the retina in multiple cell layers in the participants who had schizophrenia, including in cell types that had not been studied before in this disorder.” Presumably this meant that all of the patients with schizophrenia were identified, but there are no numbers. Also, the news release didn’t explain whether the device accurately ruled out schizophrenia in those who didn’t have it. The news release and scientific article both referred to group (averaged) data, which is distinct from individual diagnosis. What’s known about the safety of this device? And what about the chances of false positives or false negatives? The news release didn’t say. It only quoted a researcher stating the test was performed to be “as noninvasive and quick as possible.” There was no mention of limitations of this study, such as the small number of participants. It also wasn’t clear whether the study was blinded; presumably at least the study participants if not the researchers taking the measurements knew their status. A study to show the diagnostic usefulness of the device would require a much larger sample of mostly younger people, positive and negative predictive values, and involve patients with other conditions such as mood and drug abuse disorders. No disease mongering here. But the release doesn’t provide much context about the disease other than a quote from the lead researcher: “Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder, probably the most disabling disorder long term. Although we know quite a bit about it, it’s still not that well understood.” The prevalence of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders in the U.S. is estimated at 0.25 percent to 0.64 percent of the US population. The news release did not mention who funded this study, and it which wasn’t mentioned in the study itself, as far as we could tell. The release also didn’t mention that one of the authors is employed by LKC Technologies, which makes these devices. There was no discussion of how schizophrenia is diagnosed currently, which involves a checklist of symptoms such as delusions, incoherent speech, hallucinations, hearing voices, cognitive problems, or a flattening of emotions that hang on for months. How accurate is that method, and how much does it cost? The release said the device is “common in optometrists’ offices.” The news release said was this is the first time a portable device was used for these tests. The news release also notes that, “Looking at biomarkers in the eye as a way to understand psychiatric disorder is a new field of study,” but the journal article cites studies as far back as 1999. So not so new. The lead sentence oversold this study, indicating that it showed how a common device “may hold the key to faster diagnosis of schizophrenia, predicting relapse and symptom severity and assessing treatment effectiveness.” The news release headline also over-reaches. A better headline might have been the sub-title: “Researchers explore eye function in schizophrenia as a window into the brain.” But further down the news release quoted a researcher stating that the study “should help generate further research” into developing a test clinicians can use to diagnose, treat and monitor people with schizophrenia. And at the end a quote — from lead author Docia Demmin — tempered the assertion by stating “it’s too soon to call this a diagnostic tool.”",1
"""Befitting her previous position as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton’s new book, Hard Choices, ranges across the globe, occasionally looking back into history long before she took the helm at the State Department. For instance, Clinton writes that """"in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."""" We had always closely associated the Iranian Revolution with Islamic fundamentalism. Was Clinton’s summary correct? We checked in with several scholars who have studied the region, and their consensus was that Clinton was broadly correct, despite a bit of oversimplification. First, some background. The revolution began in the late 1970s, amid simmering discontent among Iranians about Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the autocratic leader who operated a feared secret police. Even as he maintained generally (but not uninterrupted) good ties to the West, his standing at home was deteriorating. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled cleric living in Paris, courted support among critics of the Shah. After a series of strikes and protests, the Shah in January 1979 left for an """"extended vacation,"""" never to return home. The handpicked leaders the Shah left behind tried to prevent Khomeini from forming a government, but after the cleric returned to Tehran in February 1979, unrest grew. In mid February, supporters of Khomeini declared a revolutionary state, and within two months, Khomeini won a national referendum. """"The strongest images of Iran's revolution come from those early years"""" of 1979 to 1982, wrote Robin Wright in her 2000 book, The Last Great Revolution: Turmoil and Transformation in Iran. """"Many still linger in the minds of outsiders: The demonstrations by rifle-toting mullahs and chador-clad women. The morgue slabs with bullet-riddled bodies of officials from the monarchy and other loyalists who were summarily executed in the course of revolutionary justice. The seizure of the United States Embassy and 52 hostages who, over the next 444 days, were often paraded with crude blindfolds in front of cameras as effigies of Uncle Sam were burned in the background by angry youths. This was the delirium."""" Largely lost in this popular image is the fact that the revolution’s supporters were not exclusively Islamist -- perhaps not even primarily Islamist. The Shah’s regime had made enemies of leftists, nationalists, intellectuals, democrats and the moderately religious. All of these groups, to one degree or another, were supporters of revolution against the Shah. Clinton """"is absolutely correct that the revolution of 1979 was a broad-based revolution against the Shah,"""" said Mohsen M. Milani, executive director of the University of South Florida’s World Center for Strategic and Diplomatic Studies. """"In fact, it was one of the most popular revolutions of the modern era."""" Gary Sick, an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and author of All Fall Down: America's Tragic Encounter With Iran and October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan, agreed. """"The fact is that most of the millions of Iranians who took to the streets to oppose the Shah did not think they were going to replace him with a theocratic state,"""" Sick said. """"That was the work of Khomeini and his followers, and it was actively opposed by many of the secular -- and even clerical -- revolutionaries."""" Some of the historians we checked with took mild issue with the phrase """"hijacked,"""" since Khomeini -- who for many Americans personifies Islamic extremism -- was always the central player in the revolution. After all, it’s hard to hijack a revolution you’d always led. But there’s an explanation for this paradox: Initially, Khomeini had openly stated that he was not pursuing a theocracy. """"Iran's emergence as a modern theocracy was never written in the heavens,"""" Wright wrote in her book. """"Quite the contrary. In earlier pronouncements about a just government Ayatollah Khomeini actually said he didn't advocate clerical rule. … In one of his last interviews before leaving Paris, Ayatollah Khomeini told Le Monde, ‘Our intention is not that religious leaders themselves should administer the state.’ """"Once the tumultuous fanfare of his return died down, the Imam seemed almost uninterested in day-to-day government affairs. The ayatollah, already in his late seventies, instead went back to the dusty theological center of Qom. He seemed content to leave politics to the first revolutionary government of secular technocrats. His role was limited to settling disputes."""" That changed with the effort to write Iran’s Constitution in the fall of 1979. """"Fearful that other changes might further marginalize or even exclude them, Ayatollah Khomeini's followers introduced a process to vet candidates' credentials -- a precedent that time and again allowed them to manipulate future elections, too,"""" Wright wrote. """"It worked. They won a majority. And the final draft (of the constitution) ended up thoroughly Islamic."""" Even then, the Islamic revolution wasn’t complete, Wright wrote: """"For the first presidential election in January 1980, a full year after the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini decreed that no clerics could run for president -- further proof that he still didn't intend to establish a total theocracy. Over the next 18 months, however, Iran was wracked by bloodshed as the ruling clergy and their adjutants gradually eliminated former partners -- leftists, nationalists and intellectuals--from any claim to power."""" Iran became fully Islamist in October 1981, when the cleric Ali Khamanei won the third presidential election -- the first election in which clerics were allowed to run. """"As of October 1981,"""" Wright wrote, """"the mullahs were no longer only the supervisors and shadows of the state. They now dominated all its branches."""" The experts we talked to quibbled slightly with Clinton’s claim, saying it’s a bit oversimplified. Notably, Clinton inaccurately compresses the time frame. The changes she’s talking about didn’t just happen immediately in 1979 but rather played out in an evolutionary fashion for two years after the Shah fell. """"If you have to do the whole history in 19 words, it's probably okay,"""" said John Limbert, historian and political scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of Iran: At War with History. Stephen Kinzer, a Boston University professor and author of the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future, said Clinton is generally correct that """"the Iranian revolution was broad-based, and one faction later seized control, establishing a brutal theocracy."""" Our ruling Clinton said that """"in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."""" She’s generally correct, experts say, despite questions over whether """"hijacked"""" is the right word and whether she used an overly broad time frame.""",0
"Not applicable. Costs weren’t mentioned, but we didn’t think that was a necessity in this case. The story provided the data on the summation of grades showing the difference in folic acid levels in the children in the highest and lowest groups. While it is nice to have absolute grade difference provided, it would have been useful to indicate whether these differences were statistically significant or whether the differences in folic acid intake were clinically significant. Not applicable. Harms not mentioned. The story could have mentioned the potential for excessive folic acid intake to interfere with vitamin B12 uptake which, though unlikely in a teen population, could mask symptoms of B12 deficiency. But we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this. The story mentioned the fact that the study was small and that the population differed in an important way from teens in the US who consume food that is supplemented with folic acid. It also pointed out that the study was not a randomized controlled trial so there may have been other differences between the groups of teens found to have high and low amounts of folic acid. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included quotes from independent sources who helped provide context and perspective on the study and its results. The story mentioned that the food supply in the US was folic acid fortified. The story stated that folic acid is one of the ‘B’ vitamins and that at least in the US, is found in fortified foods.

We found that there are indeed more community health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics -- but that doesn’t mean that redirecting dollars to them will amount to """"expanding women’s access to health services."""" Some background The GOP health care bill bill would effectively block Planned Parenthood for a year from securing reimbursements from Medicaid -- not just for abortions, which is already the case, but for any services, from pap smears to birth control. Planned Parenthood says abortion services are already walled off from payments they get for services that have nothing to do with abortion. But abortion opponents have long argued that the government is tacitly supporting abortion even by reimbursing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services, saying such money is fungible once it reaches Planned Parenthood’s coffers. The bill’s change could have a significant impact on Planned Parenthood: About 43 percent of the group’s budget comes from the government, including grants and reimbursements, much of which comes from Medicaid. The group says the bill, if enacted, could lead to closures of clinics and leave women without access to vital services, especially in medically underserved areas. Do community health centers """"vastly outnumber"""" Planned Parenthood clinics? Loudermilk has a point on the numbers of clinics. We looked at a census of clinics that provide contraceptive services published in April 2017 by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health nonprofit. The group tallied up various types of clinics, the most numerous of which are """"federally qualified health centers"""" -- defined by the federal government as """"safety-net providers that primarily provide services typically furnished in an outpatient clinic."""" Such facilities can include community health centers, migrant health centers, homeless health care centers, and public housing primary care centers. For 2015, the census tallied 5,829 federally qualified health centers nationally, compared to 676 Planned Parenthood clinics. That’s a ratio of greater than 8-to-1, so the adjective """"vastly"""" seems appropriate. Would the bill redirect money from Planned Parenthood to community health centers? Not necessarily. Planned Parenthood received about $553.7 million from the government in 2015 for its services; the group, however, does not make public what portion of that is specifically from the federal government because the funding streams from different levels of government are sometimes hard to disentangle. The best estimate we can get comes from the Congressional Budget Office, which projected that the provision blocking federal funding to Planned Parenthood would result in $178 million in reduced federal outlays. If the CBO’s projection is accurate, then the increase in federal funding to community health centers in the bill -- $422 million -- would represent a larger federal investment than the money being held back from Planned Parenthood. At first glance, that would seem to make the bill a net expansion in dollars, if you consider only these two line items. However, a couple issues balance against the notion that that this will represent an expansion of care. First, there is no guarantee that the $422 million spent would go towards the same patients, and for the same services, that would be lost due to the Planned Parenthood cuts. The bill does not explicitly require that. Another caveat comes from a different conclusion in the same CBO analysis. """"To the extent that there would be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they would affect services that help women avert pregnancies,"""" CBO wrote. """"The people most likely to experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations. CBO projects that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care."""" The immediate loss of care for 15 percent of Planned Parenthood patients also undercuts the argument that money would simply flow from one type of clinic to the other. Would redirecting funding to these centers expand women’s access to health services? There’s reason to be skeptical. For starters, common sense suggests that even if community health centers ended up being able to serve every single patient currently served by Planned Parenthood, that wouldn’t qualify as """"expanding women’s access to health services"""" -- it would simply be maintaining it. The closure of as many as 676 Planned Parenthood facilities would require an awful lot of expansion of resources elsewhere just to keep pace, before any """"expansion"""" of access begins. And there’s reason to believe that community health centers may not be able to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood centers disappear. First, there’s a capacity problem. Planned Parenthood centers tend to be unusually efficient in providing health services to women, because that’s their specialty. The average Planned Parenthood clinic served 2,950 patients for contraceptive services in 2015, compared to 320 for the average federally qualified health center, according to the Guttmacher census. """"Because by definition health centers are in medically underserved communities with elevated risk and insufficient primary care, the last thing one does is get rid of any supply,"""" Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, told PolitiFact. """"This is the corker. Health centers are overwhelmed with need."""" And currently, community health centers are already operating with a shortage of staff, making any rapid expansion that much trickier. """"Workforce challenges are one of the primary barriers to health center patient growth,"""" the National Association of Community Health Centers concluded in a 2016 report on its sector. """"If all health center clinical vacancies were filled today, health centers could serve 2 million more patients."""" And second, community health centers and Planned Parenthood clinics aren’t interchangeable, experts say. Guttmacher data indicates that Planned Parenthood centers """"are considerably more likely to offer a broad range of contraceptive methods than sites operated by other types of agencies. Nearly all Planned Parenthood health centers offer the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved reversible contraceptive methods,"""" compared to half of federally qualified health centers. Rebecca Kreitzer, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recently told the Atlantic that oral contraceptives and condoms are cheap enough that community health clinics can afford to give them out and then request federal reimbursement, but IUDs and contraceptive implants -- two long-term but reversible methods -- are often too expensive for clinics to front without immediate payment. By contrast, Planned Parenthood is a big enough network that it can afford to provide more expensive methods immediately. Because of this, Planned Parenthood clinics are also likelier to have staff on hand with the requisite expertise. """"Just because there is a federally qualified health center near where there is a Planned Parenthood Clinic does not mean we can assume the women going to Planned Parenthood would easily be served,"""" said Keith J. Mueller, head of the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Iowa. When the Atlantic investigated how prepared Iowa health clinics were to pick up patients from Planned Parenthood, they found that lists of clinics provided by Republican lawmakers included """"a dentist’s office, a school nurse, and a youth shelter"""" as well as one clinic that had closed and several that didn’t provide family-planning services. """"They're assuming we're the alternative,"""" Ted Boesen, CEO of the non-profit Iowa Primary Care Association, told the magazine. """"But we're waiting to see what kind of a scale it is."""" Finally, the Energy and Commerce Committee said it’s possible to argue """"that Planned Parenthood provides inferior overall service because they cannot offer holistic care to their patients, as they are a boutique reproductive health provider."""" But experts say the committee’s emphasis on full-spectrum health care is more expensive than reproductive health care """"Because health centers must think about the full spectrum of primary health care for all patients, the absence of a specialized safety-net provider such as Planned Parenthood would be deeply problematic,"""" Rosenbaum has written. """"When health centers attempt to respond to a surge in demand, they must think about not just the specialized services lost, but all of the health needs of the patients who find their way to a health center, not to mention those of their families. … As a result, the anticipated cost per patient served is far higher than family planning and related services alone."""" In other words, the higher cost of providing care at community health centers is another reason why the increased federal funding figure in the bill may not be sufficient for replacing the lost Planned Parenthood services. Our ruling Loudermilk said that in the House Republican health care bill, """"we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics."""" Purely on the numbers, he has a point that there are more federally qualified health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics. But the notion that bypassing Planned Parenthood would mean """"expanding"""" access is dubious. Challenges of geography, capacity, specialization and cost raise significant questions about whether existing centers, even if they were provided with Planned Parenthood’s federal revenue stream, would be able to maintain the current patient load, much less expand it.

"During the 1990s, Australia was confronting a problem similar to the one that regularly confronts Americans: shooting incidents over the previous decade had left more than a hundred people dead, including the infamous Port Arthur massacre in April 1996 that saw one gunman wielding a semi-automatic rifle kill 35 people over the course of a single day (including 20 people with 29 bullets in about 90 seconds): In 1996, Martin Bryant entered a café at the site of a historic penal colony at Port Arthur, Tasmania. The 28-year-old ate lunch before pulling a semi-automatic rifle from his bag and embarking on a killing spree. By the time he was apprehended the next morning, 35 people were dead and 23 had been wounded. Bryant had become the worst mass-murderer in Australia’s history. Australia had experienced mass shootings before, but the Port Arthur massacre shook the nation to its core. Bryant was later assessed to have the IQ of an 11-year-old. He told investigators that he’d paid cash for firearms at a local gun dealer. Shortly afterwards, John Howard, the new Australian prime minister, moved to enact nationwide gun law reform (a process complicated by the fact that the Australian national government had no control over gun ownership or use, so gun reform legislation had to be passed individually by all states and territories). Those reform efforts, known as the 1996 National Firearms Agreement (NFA), included two nationwide gun buybacks, voluntary surrenders, state gun amnesties, a ban on the importation of new automatic and semiautomatic weapons, the tightening of gun owner licensing, and the creation of uniform national standards for gun registration. Australia collected and destroyed an estimated 650,000 firearms (a reduction equivalent to the removal of about forty million guns from the United States), which reduced Australia’s firearms stock by around one-fifth. Around 2001, a piece appeared on the Internet that has been circulated widely and often ever since, attempting to make the case that Australia’s gun reform efforts were a dismal failure in terms of reducing violent crime: From: Ed Chenel, a police officer in Australia. Hi Yanks, I thought you all would like to see the real figures from Down Under. It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. The first year results are now in: Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent, Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent; Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent!). In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent. (Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not and criminals still possess their guns!) While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since the criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed. There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults of the elderly. Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in “successfully ridding Australian society of guns.” You won’t see this data on the American evening news or hear your governor or members of the state Assembly disseminating this information. The Australian experience proves it. Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws affect only the law-abiding citizens. Take note Americans, before it’s too late! The conclusions drawn in this piece were both premature and inaccurate, however. In a peer-reviewed paper published by American Law and Economics Review in 2012, researchers Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University found that in the decade following the NFA, firearm homicides (both suicides and intentional killings) in Australia had dropped significantly: In 1997, Australia implemented a gun buyback program that reduced the stock of firearms by around one-fifth (and nearly halved the number of gun-owning households). Using differences across states, we test[ed] whether the reduction in firearms availability affected homicide and suicide rates. We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80%, with no significant effect on non-firearm death rates. The effect on firearm homicides is of similar magnitude but is less precise [somewhere between 35% and 50%]. Similarly, Dr. David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found in 2011 that the NFA had been “incredibly successful in terms of lives saved”: For Australia, the NFA seems to have been incredibly successful in terms of lives saved. While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the NFA, resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres. The NFA also seems to have reduced firearm homicide outside of mass shootings, as well as firearm suicide. In the seven years before the NFA (1989-1995), the average annual firearm suicide death rate per 100,000 was 2.6 (with a yearly range of 2.2 to 2.9); in the seven years after the buyback was fully implemented (1998-2004), the average annual firearm suicide rate was 1.1 (yearly range 0.8 to 1.4). In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33) Additional evidence strongly suggests that the buyback causally reduced firearm deaths. First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates. While there is no doubt that firearms deaths in Australia have decreased substantially in the years since the implementation of the NFA, how much of that decrease is directly attributable to the NFA is still subject to debate. Much of that debate focuses on the fact that the gun death rate in Australia was already decreasing prior to the time the NFA was introduced: For Australia, a difficulty with determining the effect of the law was that gun deaths were falling in the early 1990s. No study has explained why gun deaths were falling, or why they might be expected to continue to fall. Yet most studies generally assumed that they would have continued to drop without the NFA. Many studies still found strong evidence for a beneficial effect of the law. It’s also true that in both cases, the authors of studies cautioned that NFA-like plans wouldn’t necessarily achieve (and have not achieved) the same results in the United States, in large part because Australia’s geography makes it much easier to control the flow of arms into the country: Several factors are important in assessing the extent to which the results from the Australian buyback can be extrapolated to other countries. Australian borders are more easily controlled than in countries that have land borders. In addition, Australia’s government in general and its policing and customs services in particular are highly organized and effective. The NFA also had an extremely high degree of political support and was quite competently executed. And the buyback was accompanied by a uniform national system for licensing and registration of firearms. These factors should be borne in mind in considering the extent to which the results from the Australian NFA might generalize to other countries. It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States. Levitt provides three reasons why gun buybacks in the United States have apparently been ineffective: (a) the buybacks are relatively small in scale (b) guns are surrendered voluntarily, and so are not like the ones used in crime; and (c) replacement guns are easy to obtain. These factors did not apply to the Australian buyback, which was large, compulsory, and the guns on this island nation could not easily be replaced. For example, compared to the buyback of 650,000 firearms, annual imports after the law averaged only 30,000 per year, with many of these bought by law enforcement agencies. Regardless of how much of a cause-and-effect relationship there might be between the NFA and gun deaths in Australia, it’s undeniable that the firearms homicide rate in that country has decreased substantially since the implementation of the NFA. It’s not the case, however, as suggested by the misleading and long out-of-date online piece quoted in the Example block above (which was written way back in 2001) that the overall crime rate in Australia has shot up since the NFA was introduced. The rates of various types of violent crimes (sexual assault, kidnapping, homicides of all types) have scarcely changed at all, and while the robbery rate rose substantially in the 1998-2001 timeframe, it dropped below its pre-NFA level by 2004 and has continually declined since then:",1
"""At the  Des Moines Register  debate on Dec. 12, 2007, Rudy Giuliani acknolwedged a touchy point for his campaign: He supports abortion rights. But he emphasized that he dislikes abortion and repeated a claim he's made before, that while he was mayor of New York City, the number of abortions declined while adoptions rose. """"We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent,"""" he said. We've addressed his previous claims with  this ruling  and our article  """"Giuliani's 'culture of life,' defined""""  , but he used different wording and a different number this time, so we'll examine the new statement. He's right that abortions went down. They declined 16.8 percent during Giuliani's eight-year tenure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, his wording suggests he took an active, leading role in reducing abortions. That doesn't square with his record. When we examined his tenure for our previous article, we spoke with key players familiar with his record, and they remembered a decidely abortion-rights mayor who went so far as to sign a proclamation for """"Roe vs. Wade Anniversary Day."""" He also filled out a questionnaire for an abortion-rights group pledging his support for the cause. So for him to say """"we reduced abortion"""" seems like a stretch. Two months ago, the Giuliani campaign maintained there was a link between the rise in adoptions and the decline in abortions. They now say he is not linking the two. But we believe many voters could be left with the impression that the two are related. And indeed, we couldn't find any research that showed an increase in adoptions led to a decrease in abortions. There's no question that adoptions rose during his term. But to reach 135 percent requires some serious calculator gymnastics. Two years into his first term, Giuliani created the Administration for Children's Services with a mission to improve the lives of the city's children. The agency aims to help kids in foster care, and it measures its success in large part by how many adoptions it facilitates each year. We focus on page 14 of the ACS 2003 Year End Review, which shows a bar chart of adoptions conducted through the city's child welfare system from 1989 to 2003. Giuliani was mayor from Jan. 1, 1994, to Dec. 31, 2001. His new agency came on line in January 1996. The chart shows a gradual increase in adoptions from 1989 through 1994, then a steeper increase through 1997 — the middle years of Giuliani's tenure. After that year, the numbers decline through 2002. Giuliani has previously said the rate of adoptions went up 65 to 70 percent. His campaign calculated that number by taking adoption rates for the six years before ACS was created and comparing them to the six years after. But now, Giuliani is citing a number twice as large: 135 percent. To get that number, his staff compared adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. This works out to a whopping 133 percent increase in adoptions, which Giuliani rounded up to 135. That's one way to look at it. But a more traditional way, simply comparing adoption rates in the first year of his tenure and in the last year, shows the rate increased by only 17 percent, a point first made by our friends at FactCheck.org. The Giuliani campaign said averaging the rates over two six-year (or now, eight-year) blocks helps smooth out peaks and valleys in individual years caused by social, economic and other forces. The first two years after ACS came on line, there was a spike in adoptions that Giuliani's campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families. It's true, the campaign aides say, the numbers go down significantly in Giuliani's final two years. But they're still higher than those of his predecessor, David Dinkins. We find that's an unorthodox way of comparing the numbers and it relies on a different methodology than the abortion rate. For the abortion statistic, the Giuliani campaign looked at two points in time (the beginning and end of his tenure) and compared the two. Doing that for adoptions yields an increase of 17 percent. But here, they're trying some creative math to boost the number to 133. So, we find that while he's got his numbers right on abortion rates, it's a stretch for the abortion-rights mayor to take credit. We also find he has inflated the adoption figures by getting fancy with his math. It's worth saying again that to arrive at the """"135 percent"""" increase in adoption rates the Giuliani campaign had to change the way it had been calculating those rates just a few months ago. We find his overall claim Barely True.""",1
"Cost isn’t discussed. Various online estimates for carotid ultrasounds put them at $200-$800. Here’s what the story says: “People with the most intense pulses, which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow, were up to 50% more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions.” First, we need to point out that it wasn’t a pulse researchers were measuring, but something known as forward compression waves (FCW) in the neck arteries. The story doesn’t include vital data-driven information for readers, such as: Also the story never makes it clear that, based on these observational study results, we don’t really know if doctors can “spot dementia 10 years earlier” just because of FCW. Nor that we have no know way of knowing to what extent identifying this risk allows patients to take action to improve their FCW score and therefore improve cognitive outcomes. Some useful reading: Observational studies: Does the language fit the evidence? Association vs. causation Absolute vs relative risk The biggest risk with a screening test like this is incorrect results–false positives and false negatives, which the story never explains. There is significant harm that can result if a person thinks they are at high risk of dementia when they aren’t, or thinks they’re at low-risk when they’re high risk. These are otherwise known as a test’s sensitivity and specificity and they should have been discussed, especially how these unknowns will guide next steps for future research. The story never explains that the study is observational, so cause-and-effect conclusions can’t be drawn. It hints at the need for future research, which would have been a good segue to talk about the limitations of this study. No disease mongering here. However, it is worth noting that the story does make one confusing statement. In a sentence immediately following a paragraph about dementia, the story states that “In the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults.” That’s inaccurate. Alzheimer’s disease, specifically, is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults, according to the CDC. Dementia and Alzheimer’s are lumped together by the UK’s Office for National Statistics, which may have led to the confusion. The story does not address conflicts of interest. The study abstract notes that several researchers have ties to The Brain Protection Company. It is not clear to what extent that company may potentially benefit from the findings, if at all. The company does have patents related to dementia treatment (such as this one). The story explains that researchers are attempting to see if the test should be added as part of “routine screening” for risk factors. It would have been helpful to briefly explain what is currently included in routing screening. The story makes clear that more work needs to be done before this becomes anything approaching a standard of care. The story doesn’t put this study in context of previous research. What is already known about FCW and dementia? Is the first study to find a pattern between the two? The story does not appear to be based on a news release.",1
"The story never mentions the costs of drug or surgical treatments, even though it discusses numerous treatments. We wish it had spent some time on this point. The story mentions that diet programs can be not “affordable” in the long term, but what about drug treatments? Especially those that have only modest efficacy? How much does a drug like Contrave typically cost a patient? These would have been easy issues to address. The benefits of these drugs are not quantified. Instead, the benefits of exercise and diet are cited, but only to note that those remedies are ultimately ineffectual. This seems to be a selective reading of the literature. Although some harms are mentioned, the story never quantifies them. It should not have to recite detailed rates of adverse events for every drug mentioned, but it would have been nice to see at least one example detailed. This story is all about the quality of the evidence. Dr. Thomas’ quote is a case in point. “”It’s a balance,” Thomas added. Each panel carefully weighs a drug’s effectiveness against its safety. If weight-loss results look good, then potential side effects (unless they’re extremely serious) might not be weighed so heavily. But if a drug isn’t very effective, “then the safety issues become magnified.” So, for example, in the case of lorcaserin, panel members were hesitant to recommend approval because trials “barely proved” effectiveness, Thomas said.” The story engages in disease-mongering by presenting obesity as a disease that can be cured, if only the right pill is developed. Obesity deserves to be treated as a disease, but it doesn’t necessary follow that pharmaceuticals offer the only real hope of effective treatment or prevention. This story is framed as forecast of a frightening future in which drug companies stop investing in experimental weight loss pills… as if the central problem is heavy-handed regulation, rather than the difficulty of altering metabolism and other biological systems in a way that doesn’t produce unhealthy side effects. While there are independent sources that present a variety of viewpoints, readers should have told about the ties some of them have to the pharmaceutical industry. The Obesity Society, which provides the first source in the story, is funded almost entirely by drug companies. One of the quoted experts, Dr. Judith Stern, is an accomplished obesity researcher, but she is also the co-founder of the group that is now the Obesity Society. Dr. Ken Fujioka received $12,400 from drug companies in 2009. None of these conflicts is noted. The story does compare the pill approach to other methods, but we feel that the comparisons are made merely to knock down all other alternatives. This was not a serious comparison. The story’s focus is on the lack of treatment and the inability for any obesity drug to gain any traction. It does a good job on this score. It takes readers carefully through the history of anti-obesity drugs and presents, in broad terms, their successes and subsequent failures. The story does a great job explaining how difficult it has been to find a drug that will actually reduce people’s weight without raising their risk for other problems, particularly cardiovascular problems. The story does not rely on a news release.",1
"Robyn Benson was just 22 weeks pregnant when she complained of a headache and then collapsed on her bathroom floor, according to postings on a blog and fundraising site by her husband Dylan Benson. Her fetus, already named Iver Cohen Benson, has continued to grow in the womb. “On December 28th, I lost my wife to a sudden hemorrhage of blood to her brain,” Benson wrote. “Based on my decision, they are attempting to keep her body alive for up to 7 more weeks ... Incredibly, they have been successful in doing this for 5 weeks now.”  The goal is to wait until the fetus reaches 34 weeks, giving the baby a greater chance of survival, according to Benson. He wrote that doctors plan to deliver his son via cesarean section and that the baby will spend his first few weeks in hospital. That sets up a bittersweet deadline for the family, who will welcome a new baby and then take the mother off life support. “It is very difficult to know that our son will grow up never meeting his wonderful mother, and that we will have to say our goodbyes to Robyn within hours of seeing Iver for the first time,” Benson wrote. “She was my rock. She did so much for us, and I can’t believe I won’t get to talk to her again.”  The tragic story differs from a controversial case in Texas, where Marlise Munoz, a pregnant brain-dead woman was removed from life support at her husband’s request last month after a lengthy court battle. Her husband said Munoz had told him she did not want to be kept on life support. Unlike the Benson baby, which is healthier, Munoz’s fetus had already suffered oxygen deprivation and appeared to have deformed lower extremities, according to court documents. Texas authorities had fought to keep Munoz on life support in a case that sparked fierce debate over the rights of a fetus versus the right to die. A spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island health authority confirmed that there is a patient named Robyn Benson in the intensive care unit at the Victoria General Hospital, but was not able to provide further details due to privacy issues. The Benson family’s plight has gripped people across Canada and around the world, with donations on their fundraising site topping C$85,000 ($76,700) early on Tuesday. That has far exceeded the C$36,000 goal set by Benson, who had hoped to raise funds for bills, baby supplies and to allow him to more time at home with his new son after the birth. “I just wanted to reach out and say thank you to each and every one of you that have read our story and to those who have donated and/or shared,” he wrote on the site on Monday. “We are overwhelmed with the response from not only the community, but now the nation and beyond.”  (This story has been refiled to correct spelling of deprivation in seventh paragraph)",0
"In mid-April 2019, shortly after a fire broke out at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, an image supposedly showing a screenshot from an episode of the television show The Simpsons started to circulate on social media attached to the claim that the longest-running American sitcom had once again “predicted” the future:  The Simpsons show did not predict the fire at Notre Dame. While a cartoon version of the Notre Dame Cathedral does appear at least once in the fictional town of Springfield, this image has been digitally edited. The original still from the show didn’t feature the church on fire, nor Mr. Burns standing outside. The Notre Dame of Springfield appears in the episode “Husbands and Knives” from the show’s 19th season. As with many other “prediction” rumors, The Simpsons was actually spoofing a previous event, not predicting one that had yet to occur. In this case, the show was parodying The Hunchback of Notre Dame. A description of the episode notes that after Homer undergoes plastic surgery to become a “trophy husband,” he gets chased by an angry mob into the Notre Dame Cathedral of Springfield with Marge in his arms: Homer (in his new hideous look) carrying Marge up the Notre Dame is reminiscent of a scene in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. After Homer gets his new and disgusting form, Mayor Quimby orders the town to raise their pitchforks and attack Homer. Homer and Marge run to the top of Notre Dame of Springfield tower and Marge, saying she wants a trophy husband, deliberately pushes Homer off the tower.

"""As congressional town halls across the country increasingly draw loud protests from critics of Democratic health care legislation, a debate is brewing about whether the protests are more raucous than those four years ago against President George W.

We conclude that while some of the recent conservative protests — such as ones at town halls in Tampa, Little Rock, Ark., Houston, Philadelphia, and Green Bay, Wis.— may have been angrier and more widespread than the ones in 2005, it would be incorrect to suggest, as Krugman does, that the noisy demonstrations against Bush's policies were only taking place outside the events or that disruptions were limited to the occasional boo. We used the Lexis-Nexis news database to find newspaper and wire service stories in calendar year 2005 that included the words """"town hall,"""" """"Social Security,"""" and a variant of either """"protest,"""" """"heckler"""" or """"shout."""" The search returned just under 250 articles. Not all were relevant, and a majority of ones that were relevant addressed town halls hosted by President Bush rather than Members of Congress. Generally speaking, the Bush events were, as Krugman correctly notes, held in front of largely handpicked crowds, which meant that little disruption went on inside the hall. Most of them, as he also notes, inspired protests outside, some of them loud and unruly, and all of them kept at a distance by the Secret Service. (At one event in Westfield, N.J., for instance, a protest that included """"hundreds"""" of people led to the arrest of nine people on disorderly conduct charges.) But for this comparison, we need to look at town halls sponsored by members of Congress. News coverage was more spotty, but here is a sampling of examples we found in which journalists reported conflict inside an event:   — """"At two stops, morning at Drexel University, afternoon at Widener University, [Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.] encountered skepticism and hostility as he voiced his support for the White House plan to allow creation of personal accounts using payroll taxes. He was heckled by protesters, called a liar, and told that his views were unconscionable. Those sentiments ranged across the age spectrum. …   """"Santorum asked the audience what would happen in 2008. The response he wanted was that the oldest baby boomers would turn 62 and be eligible for early retirement. """"What he got instead, shouted out by an unfriendly voice, was: ‘George Bush will leave office!’   """"Actually, that's scheduled for 2009. But many in the crowd cheered anyway."""" (Feb. 23, 2005,  Philadelphia Inquirer  )   — """"Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., delivered a PowerPoint presentation Thursday night to a packed auditorium in Phoenix. As he laid out the long-term demographic problems for Social Security and expressed his support for private accounts, Shadegg encountered scattered heckling, boos and hisses. (Feb. 26,  Chicago Tribune  )   — A session sponsored by Rep. Chris Chocola, R-Ind., in South Bend, at the downtown branch of the St. Joseph County Public Library """"was a raucous affair, with many of the 100 or so people who attended shouting questions and insults, talking over each other and still bubbling with questions when it was all over. """"One gentleman was so angry when Chocola indicated the hour-long session was coming to an end and wouldn't be extended that he walked out."""" (  South Bend Tribune  , Feb. 27, 2005)   — John Busch, a letter-writer to a newspaper in Chico, Calif., said, """"I attended Congressman Wally Herger's recent town hall meeting in Chico regarding Social Security. I must have witnessed more rude, disrespectful behavior from an audience somewhere along the line, I just can't remember where. The congressman's efforts to provide and gather information were continually thwarted by hecklers who seemed not to care what the congressman had to say, but whose sole reason for attending the meeting was to be rude and disruptive. They certainly accomplished that."""" (May 8, 2005,  Enterprise-Record  of Chico, Calif.)   Republican officials at the time said that about 95 House lawmakers took part in 287 Social Security-related events in February, with more held in March, so in all likelihood, there were many, many events that did not result in news coverage we could find. So we can't say whether there were protests or shouting matches. And some stories noted the meetings were civil. For example, a Feb. 26, 2005,  Chicago Tribune  report found that a meeting held by Rep. Rick Renzi, R-Ariz., had """"no booing or shouting or threatening tirades. A volunteer from AARP took notes and politely reminded Renzi that ‘Social Security is a retirement plan and a family protection plan. It is not an investment plan.’"""" And a different Chocola event, according to the news account, """"was quiet, orderly and polite, with the 60 or so persons on hand taking turns asking questions and listening to Chocola's response."""" Still, the protests inside and outside town halls, even if they were not universal, clearly rattled Republican leaders. On March 17, 2005,  USA Today  reported:   """"Shaken by raucous protests at open ‘town hall’-style meetings last month, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Deborah Pryce of Ohio and other GOP leaders are urging lawmakers to hold lower-profile events this time. … This month, Republican leaders say they are chucking the open town-hall format. They plan to visit newspaper editorial boards and talk to constituents at Rotary Club lunches, senior citizen centers, chambers of commerce meetings and local businesses. In those settings, ‘there isn't an opportunity for it to disintegrate into something that's less desirable,’ says Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference."""" And leaders of the movement against changing Social Security made no bones about being aggressive. Brad Woodhouse, then a spokesman for Americans United to Protect Social Security, the labor-backed group that was a key player in the fight against Bush’s proposal, told the  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  on March 20, 2005 that """"we are going to be getting in the faces of people who are for privatization; they're going to feel the heat. ... It's vociferous, it's rough, it's tough."""" It’s worth noting that today, Woodhouse is on the other side, so to speak — criticizing the people who are disrupting town halls. He is the communications director for the Democratic National Committee and issued a statement on Aug. 4, 2009, blasting """"the Republican Party and Allied Groups’ Mob Rule,"""" saying it was """"inciting angry mobs of a small number of rabid right wing extremists funded by K Street Lobbyists to disrupt thoughtful discussions about the future of health care in America taking place in Congressional Districts across the country."""" He continued, """"The right wing extremists’ use of things like devil horns on pictures of our elected officials, hanging members of Congress in effigy, breathlessly questioning the president's citizenship and the use of Nazi SS symbols and the like just shows how outside of the mainstream the Republican Party and their allies are. This type of anger and discord did not serve Republicans well in 2008 — and it is bound to backfire again."""" It is true that there’s nothing in the clips from 2005 about burning members of Congress in effigy or the use of devils’ horns. But Woodhouse’s group employed 28-foot gorillas, duck suits, plates of hot waffles and sheet cakes as props, according to an Aug. 13, 2005, report in the  Albuquerque Tribune  . So while the protests may be more intense this time (devils' horns instead of duck suits), it's clear that there was plenty of disruption inside town hall meetings in 2005, contrary to Krugman's assertions. We find his claim .""",1
"Although we can’t confirm all the details of the following item (it may have become embellished through multiple retellings, or it may derive from a source other than the one we located), we can verify that the basics of the incident related are true: Every month in “The Journal of Human Sexuality,” they publish a “case of the month.” One of my favorites involved a married woman who went to the gynecologist complaining of a malodorous discharge. The doctor performed an exam, but the discharge wasn’t characteristic of any of the usual maladies that sometimes plague women. He wasn’t all that alarmed, though, until the results of the pap smear came back. The report indicated that the cells “weren’t human.” It didn’t venture a guess as to the origin of the cells — it just indicated they weren’t a type of cell that you’d see in a human being. The doctor asked the woman to come back for a repeat exam. He put her in the stirrups, inserted his speculum into the woman’s vagina, and scooped out a large piece of loose, decaying flesh. Remarkably, it looked like a long tongue, but certainly not a human tongue. The woman, upon questioning, finally confessed that her husband was a hunter. He had recently brought home a deer and gutted and dressed it in their garage. She saw the tongue, admired its length, and had snuck off with it to use as a masturbatory aid. She didn’t remember leaving it up there. A 1990 article published in the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology described a case in which a 29-year-old woman visited a clinic “complaining of missed periods and seeking termination of a possible pregnancy.” The examining physician found and removed a “cylindrical mass of pale-gray tissue” (7 cm long and 3 cm in diameter) from her vagina. The elicitation of “further historical information” from the patient confirmed “the object was a deer tongue used for masturbation.” The journal article provided no details about how the woman had obtained the deer tongue, how long it had been lodged in her vagina, or whether she had truly forgotten about it until she started missing periods. (It’s quite possible the patient inserted the tongue only a day or two earlier, been unable to retrieve it herself, and then made up a story about being concerned over missed periods and a possible pregnancy as a means of prompting a doctor’s examination because she was too embarrassed to disclose to medical personnel the true nature of her complaint.) The authors of the article did, however, explain their motivations for presenting this case history via a medical journal: The topic of autoeroticism usually enters the medical literature through reviews or case reports detailing death or injury. Our review of the Index Medicus found 42 citations under the heading of autoeroticism: 14 of these detailed various psychological aspects of such practices, and 27 were directly related to deaths arising from autoerotic practices. Only one reference reviewed various nonlethal autoerotic practices. Over a 42-year period, Aliabadi et al. recorded 18 patients, only three of whom were women, who presented with foreign-body insertion for erotic purposes. All three women had inserted foreign bodies into the urinary tract. Acts of autoeroticism involving vaginal masturbation with foreign objects are perhaps more common. None to our knowledge have been reported because these do not result in death or injury, and typically would not come to medical attention. The literature discloses examples of foreign bodies extracted from the male and female lower urinary tract because objects of small diameter may be retracted by natural muscular impulses into the proximal urethra and/or bladder. Indeed, according to Kinsey and others >90% of foreign bodies found in the female bladder or urethra are there as a result of masturbation. Also, large objects retrieved from the vagina are found mostly in married women aged 17-30. However, these objects, most commonly bananas, cucumbers, and other large vegetables, rarely come to surgical attention.",0
"""U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz pointed blame at Republicans -- namely Gov. Rick Scott -- for not doing more to dish out dollars to prevent the spread of the Zika virus. """"While he seems to be saying out loud that he wants Congress and the president to provide more funding, he conveniently leaves out that he cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state’s mosquito research lab a few years ago,"""" Wasserman Schultz said at a town hall in Broward County on Aug. 8. Wasserman Schultz is running for re-election in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary against first-time candidate Tim Canova. Did Scott cut funding and close the state’s mosquito research lab? There’s a lot more nuance to this story than Wasserman Schultz lets on. Mosquito control budget The current Zika pandemic took off in May 2015, when Brazil reported cases in connection with more babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. When Wasserman Schultz spoke, there had been a total of 422 Zika cases in South Florida, the majority acquired while traveling and 16 locally acquired. Wasserman Schultz told reporters that she was referring to Scott’s budget decisions in 2011. Her spokesman pointed to an article in Politico that explained cuts to state aid to local mosquito control programs. That was Scott’s first budget year after he ran on a platform to slash spending amid the recession. State budget records show that while Florida under Scott cut money to mosquito control his first two years, the state later raised it substantially: 2010-11: $2.2 million (Gov. Charlie Crist's last budget) 2011-12: $1.3 million (Scott’s first budget) 2012-13: $1 million 2013-14: $2.7 million 2014-15: $2.8 million 2015-16: $2.7 million 2016-17: $2.8 million Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Scott, said that he has invested more than $13.2 million in funding for mosquito prevention and control. Separately, """"Gov. Scott has allocated more than $26 million to combat Zika and will continue to allocate more if necessary,"""" she said. Mosquito lab Wasserman Schultz’s claim about the closed lab relates to the Florida A&M University Public Health Entomology Research and Education Center in Panama City Beach. In 2011, Scott vetoed a one-time $500,000 appropriation for the center intended to keep it open after it had faced threats of closure. The center, first opened in 1964, was referred to as the """"mosquito lab"""" or PHEREC, and came up with ways to combat mosquitoes. It was once a part of a state department, but in the 1990s it became part of Florida A&M while still receiving state health department dollars and other grants. In 2010 as Florida A&M was cutting millions of dollars from the university amid state cuts, it announced that PHEREC was on the chopping block. Provost Cynthia Hughes Harris said at the time that the university decided to eliminate non-teaching units such as the mosquito lab. In a last-ditch attempt to save the lab, researchers sought a one-time appropriation from the 2011 Legislature for $500,000 late in the budget process. Florida TaxWatch labeled it a """"turkey,"""" and Scott vetoed it as part of his $615 million in vetoes as the state was climbing out of the recession. The lab still had $1.4 million -- enough to keep it open -- but the university chose to shutter it anyway, wrote Dr. John Smith, the center’s former director, in a Florida Mosquito Control Association newsletter. """"In fact, there were sufficient reserve funds to continue PHEREC for as much as two or three years without the legislative appropriation,"""" Smith wrote. """"Why FAMU did not allow this remains unclear."""" Walter J. Tabachnick, at the time director of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory at the University of Florida’s site near Vero Beach, warned about the loss of dollars in a blog after the cuts. """"How can one quantify the loss of future opportunities to make progress and improvements in Florida mosquito control?"""" he wrote. """"There will be future problems for which we will not have solutions, there will be lost opportunities to make mosquito control more effective, efficient, and environmentally proper."""" However, Tabachnick who remains a professor at UF, told PolitiFact Florida that the decision to close the lab wasn’t by Scott. """"The decision to close PHEREC, to withdraw all funding, was made by Florida A&M, not the governor,"""" he said. Meanwhile, the state has funded research at a different university center. The Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory at UF has received $500,000 annually from the state since 2013-14. That money is for research to develop and test formulations, application techniques, and procedures of pesticides and biological control agents to control mosquitoes that can cause public health or a nuisance. Speaking to reporters after her town hall, Wasserman Schultz pointed the finger at Scott for the spread of Zika. """"He bears some responsibility in this problem that we are facing now since we are not as fully prepared as we could be if those cuts had not come down,"""" she said. But Tabachnick says it’s not so simple. """"There are no promises in investment in research,"""" he said. """"I don’t know what information we may have had or not. It’s like saying if we had more money in cancer, we would find a cure. I can’t say that."""" Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Scott """"cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state’s mosquito research lab a few years ago."""" In 2011, the Legislature under Scott did cut about $1 million for mosquito control dropping the total to about $1.3 million and cut it again by about $300,000 the following year. But the state then increased the budget to about $2.7 million the next year and it has remained in that ballpark for four years. Scott also vetoed a one-time appropriation of $500,000 in 2011 for a mosquito lab at FAMU, and the university then shut it down. But the center was already on the university’s chopping block, and the state has since funded another university’s lab.""",1
"""A lawmaker seeking to ban the killing of dogs and cats by carbon monoxide says the method is used in 29 animal shelters around Texas, according to a March 19, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news article. We wondered. The claim by Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, was aired as a Senate committee sent Watson’s proposal, Senate Bill 360, to the Senate, which advanced the measure to the House about a week later. The proposal, like companion legislation by Rep. Eddie Lucio III, D-Brownsville, would remove a provision from state law permitting a person to euthanize a dog or cat in an animal shelter using compressed carbon monoxide. Other animals, including birds and reptiles, could still be killed by the method, but dogs and cats in shelters could only be killed by injection with sodium pentobarbital, which is considered more humane and less costly. The story said the list of shelters using carbon monoxide--none of them in Central Texas--was compiled by the Texas Humane Legislative Network, a nonprofit that lobbies on behalf of animal welfare, which Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal described as Watson’s source for statistics related to the proposal. In a """"fact sheet"""" posted online, the network says it contacted the state’s 1,200-plus cities and found that 32 Texas animal shelters, including one in Greenville, """"continue to utilize the outdated and inhumane carbon monoxide method of euthanasia."""" Separately, in a February 2013 blog post, the network’s vice president, Shelby Bobosky, said more than 30 Texas cities, including Sherman and Terrell, stopped using carbon monoxide euthanasia within the last five years. By email, one of the network’s lobbyists, Jack Erskine, sent us a chart, dated March 18, 2013, listing 31 cities as using carbon monoxide to euthanize animals: Beeville; Bovina; Bracketville; Cuero; Devine; Eagle Pass; El Campo; Freer; Ganado; George West; Grand Saline; Greenville; Hondo; Kenedy; Kermit; Kingsville; Lyford; Mathis; Odessa; Plainview; Portland; Raymondville; Refugio; Sabinal; Seminole; Sinton; Stinnett; Taft; Van Horn; Victoria; and Yoakum. The chart says that all but two of these results were confirmed by the group from Dec. 17, 2012, through March 4, 2013. Practices vary, according to footnotes to the chart quoting email responses from cities. Cuero responded that in 2011, 12 juvenile animals were euthanized by injection while 513 others were subjected to carbon monoxide. Bobosky pointed out that a state rule already bars carbon monoxide from being used to euthanize any animal """"reasonably presumed to be less than 16 weeks of age"""" or for """"any animal that could be anticipated to have decreased respiratory function, such as the elderly, sick, injured or pregnant."""" The rule continues: """"Such animals may be resistant to the effects of carbon monoxide and the time required to achieve death in these animals may be significantly increased. In animals with decreased respiratory function, carbon monoxide levels rise slowly, making it more likely that these animals will experience elevated levels of stress."""" According to another footnote to the network’s chart, El Campo said it would start using injection on a trial basis in 2013. Meantime, Freer reported that its shelter had been demolished and no one was currently trained to euthanize animals, while Ganado said its shelter had been shut down and gave no indication if gas would be used in a shelter under construction, according to a footnote. Bobosky said by email that the number of shelters using carbon monoxide has dropped to 29 because Ganado and Freer no longer do so. More broadly, Bobosky said by phone, she and other network volunteers established the list by making public information requests of more than 1,100 Texas cities and towns, starting in November 2011, and asking if jurisdictions had animal shelters using gas to kill dogs and cats. If so, she said, they asked how many animals had been killed by the method in 2011. Bobosky said around 150 cities failed to respond; follow-up interviews indicated none of these cities had shelters. Bobosky said the number of shelters saying they use gas to euthanize has gone down since the network initially inquired in 2011, when the tally was 38 to 40. (She emailed us a network list of cities that do not use gas, among them San Marcos, Seguin and Taylor.) For instance, she said, Sherman ordered its last gas cylinder, which ultimately went unused, in March 2012. """"There is a trend in the last two years to simply stop using gas,"""" she said. """"It’s outdated."""" Finally, we spot-checked whether three bigger cities on the list referenced by Watson use carbon monoxide to euthanize dogs and cats. By phone, Sgt. Sherrie Carruth of the Odessa Police Department and Hector Chavez, an Eagle Pass official, separately said their local animal shelters use """"compressed carbon monoxide."""" Joe Lopez, Victoria’s chief animal control officer, told us its shelter uses carbon monoxide to euthanize some dogs and cats, but depends on injections of a sodium pentobarbital solution for puppies, kittens and especially old or sickly cats and dogs. A twist: While not on the network’s list of carbon monoxide users, Maverick County offered a departure from the common practices. Apolonio Rodriguez, the county's road and bridges supervisor, said that about a year ago, the county stopped taking county-collected dogs and cats to the Eagle Pass city shelter to be euthanized, instead """"using the rifle"""" to kill such animals. Bobosky, informed of our spot-checks, said the law that Watson seeks to amend already limits residents from euthanizing cats or dogs except by using commercially compressed carbon monoxide or sodium pentobarbital, meaning rifles should not be used. Our ruling Watson said 29 cities use carbon monoxide to euthanize dogs and cats. That’s supported by an advocacy group’s survey research, it appears, though the total also has gone down by more than 10 cities since 2011, according to the group. We rate this claim as .""",0
"The photo of a weasel riding on the back of a flying woodpecker appears to be real. Amateur photographer Martin Le-May said he was bird watching at a park in Essex, England, when he heard the screech of a bird in distress, Reuters  reports: “I picked my camera up, the bird flew off, and flew toward us. I snapped and took a couple photographs and realized, as I was doing that, there was something on the back of the woodpecker,” Martin le-May said. The photo went viral on Twitter just hours after Martin Le-May posted it. Thousands of users commented on the photo with the hashtag  #weaselpecker. The bird in question is a  European green woodpecker. The species can weigh up to 8 ounces, and its wingspan can measure up to 16 inches, so it’s a pretty large bird. The green woodpecker feeds on insects like ants, beetles and caterpillars — which is probably what the bird in the photo was doing when he was attacked by a  least weasel that latched onto its back. Known as a small but fierce carnivore, the least weasel preys on birds, rabbits and frogs. It eats 40-60% of its bodyweight each day. The photo doesn’t appear to be doctored, either. Henry Farid, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College, said he saw no evidence that the photo was not real, National Geographic  reports: “’’This would have required a nearly perfect and coincidental alignment of the two animals in their original photos so that they could be composited together,” said Farid. “This type of forgery is therefore more difficult to create than, for example, two animals simply standing side-by-side.’ There were also multiple photos of the scene, which would be nearly impossible to replicate, Farid said, There also weren’t any lighting, color, focus or quality differences between the weasel and the bird. And there’s good news: the green woodpecker successfully evaded the weasel’s attack and lived to see another day, Le-May  said: “’The woodpecker landed in front of us and I feared the worst. I guess our presence; maybe 25 meters away, momentarily distracted the weasel. The woodpecker seized the opportunity and flew up and away into some bushes away to our left. Quickly the bird gathered its self respect and flew up into the trees and away from our sight. The woodpecker left with its life, the weasel just disappeared into the long grass, hungry.’”  Comments",0
"One of the many bits of “secret” information that history buffs love to pass around is the rumor that the Seal of the President of the United States undergoes a surreptitious change in wartime, with the regular seal being swapped for slightly a different version in which the eagle’s head is turned to face the talon clutching a group of arrows (rather than facing the talon holding an olive branch, the symbol of peace) as a subtle visual reminder that the nation is at war. This rumor has been made familiar to modern audiences through its mention in the political television drama The West Wing, as well as its inclusion in author Dan Brown’s 2002 political thriller Deception Point:  Herney had always believed the most dominating aspect of the Oval Office was the colorful American eagle emblazoned on the room’s oval carpet. The eagle’s left talon clutched an olive branch and his right a bundle of arrows. Few outsiders knew that during times of peace, the eagle faced left — toward the olive branch. But in times of war, the eagle mysteriously faced right — toward the arrows. The mechanism behind this little parlor trick was the source of quiet speculation among White House staff because it was traditionally known only by the President and the head of housekeeping. The truth behind the enigmatic eagle, Herney had found to be disappointingly mundane. A storage room in the basement contained the second oval carpet, and housekeeping simply swapped the carpets in the dead of night. Although the Seal of the President of the United States has undergone various changes over the years, its design is fixed by executive order and is not altered during wartime, as White House curator Bill Allman explained in response to a July 2004 query:  Q: I got into a debate with a friend after reading the book ‘Deception Point’ by Dan Brown. Is there any truth to the section about switching the carpet in the Oval Office when the country is at war or peace? Specifically, the American Eagle’s talons facing left toward the olive branch in peace and right toward the arrows at times of war. I personally think it’s fiction but my friend is insistent that it is a fact. A: There is just one Seal of the President at any given time, and it does not change according to whether or not the United States is at war. However, the Seal has undergone modifications over the years. President Truman modified the Seal in 1945, and the changes included turning the eagle’s head to face its right as opposed to its left. A press release issued after the new design was approved said, “In the new Coat of Arms, Seal and Flag, the Eagle not only faces to its right — the direction of honor — but also toward the olive branches of peace which it holds in its right talon. Formerly the eagle faced toward the arrows in its left talon — arrows, symbolic of war.”  Although the eagle featured in the Presidential Seal has faced its right ever since, there are items in the White House collection that were made before 1945 that display the eagle facing its left (such as state services, furnishings, architectural elements, etc.) A video posted to the Obama White House YouTube Channel provides further evidence:  The last paragraph of the above-quoted response might provide a clue as to how this rumor began. The Great Seal of the United States includes a coat of arms featuring an eagle clutching thirteen arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other, its head facing to the viewer’s left, towards the talon with the olive branch. Presidential flags had historically featured a similar coat of arms, but in 1916 President Woodrow Wilson issued an executive order that changed the design slightly, such that the eagle’s head was modified face to the viewer’s right, towards the talon holding the arrows:  The coat of arms on the presidential flag changed again in 1945 when President Harry Truman issued Executive Order 9646, which made several alterations to the presidential flag and seal, among which was the reversal of the eagle’s head so that it once more faced in the same direction as the one on the Great Seal of the United States:  As biographer David McCullough noted of Truman’s motivation for making the change:  One morning, standing at his desk, [Truman] presented to the press a new presidential flag … “This new flag faces the eagle toward the staff,” Truman explained, “which is looking to the front all the time when you are on the march, and also has him looking at the olive branch for peace, instead of the arrows for war …” Both the flag and presidential seal had been redesigned for the first time since the Wilson years, and Truman meant the shift in the eagle’s gaze to be seen as symbolic of a nation both on the march and dedicated to peace. Possibly, in retrospect, some people recalled that the eagle on the presidential flag or seal had changed around the time of World War I (President Wilson’s executive order was issued eleven months before the U.S. entered that conflict) then changed again just after World War II (President Truman’s executive order was issued less than two months after the formal surrender of Japan), and they mistakenly assumed the events were connected rather than coincidental: A casual observer, unaware that the presidential flag had not been altered at the end of World War I or the beginning of World War II, might have surmised that the eagle’s head had always faced towards the olive branch, and its occasional reversal was a wartime aberration. The notion of a presidential seal that featured as its centerpiece an eagle whose gaze changed direction based upon the state of belligerency in the world was the subject of a wry comment made by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill as he was visiting with President Truman in 1946:  Pointing to the President’s seal on the wall of the [train] car, Truman explained that he had had the eagle’s head turned to face the olive branch. Churchill said he thought the eagle’s head should be on a swivel.",1
"A socially conservative province where the Catholic and Protestant faiths exert strong influence, Northern Ireland allows abortion only when a mother’s life is in danger. The penalty for undergoing or performing an unlawful abortion is life imprisonment. As a result, women facing tragic circumstances such as a pregnancy resulting from rape or a diagnosis of fatal fetal abnormality, meaning that a baby will not survive outside the womb, have been forced to carry their pregnancies to term. “The impact of the criminal law in Northern Ireland does amount to inhuman and degrading treatment by the state,” said Nathalie Lieven, lead counsel for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which is spearheading the legal action. The commission, an independent body, launched legal action against Northern Ireland’s government in 2014, arguing that the law violates the human rights of women and girls. The case has been working its way through the courts ever since. A panel of seven Supreme Court judges in London will hear arguments for and against the proposed changes during a three-day hearing. They will give their judgment at a later date. Lieven began by giving the judges an overview of detailed evidence provided by several women and girls. One of them, Ashleigh Topley, was told when she was four-and-a-half months pregnant in 2013 that her baby’s limbs were not growing and she was going to die. Topley was told there was nothing to be done and she had to carry on with the pregnancy until her baby died inside the womb, or until she went into labor which would cause the baby to die. Topley had to endure 15 weeks of anguish as the pregnancy progressed. She has described how people would ask her if it was her first child, if she wanted a boy or a girl, and other well-meaning questions which exacerbated her suffering. In the end, Topley went into labor at 35 weeks and the baby girl’s heart stopped. Other cases described to the judges included that of a girl under 13 years old who was pregnant as a result of sexual abuse by a relative. After police and social services got involved, the distraught girl had to be taken outside of Northern Ireland for the first time in her life to have an abortion. Northern Ireland’s elected assembly voted against changing abortion laws in February 2016. The law is far less restrictive in the rest of the United Kingdom, and hundreds of Northern Irish women travel to England every year to have unwanted pregnancies terminated. As well as the parties in the case, the court will hear from organizations that support changing the law, such as Humanists UK, Amnesty International and a United Nations working group on discrimination against women. It will also hear from groups who oppose any reform, such as Catholic bishops from the province and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes the legal action as a “crusade against disabled babies”.

"On 15 May, Facebook user Kelly Rose Joniec posted an account of her daughter’s hospitalization two days earlier, after accidentally swallowing part of a fidget spinner (an enormously popular children’s toy): We had a pretty eventful Saturday. On the way home from a fun swim meet, I heard Britton make an odd retching noise in the back seat as I was driving. Looking back in the mirror, I saw her face turning red and drool pouring from her mouth – she could utter noises but looked panicked so I immediately pulled over. She pointed to her throat saying she’d swallowed something, so I attempted Heimlich but there was no resistance. She said she’d put part of her fidget spinner in her mouth to clean it and somehow swallowed it. Frantic, I went straight to urgent care where they checked her for choking. They couldn’t discern where the foreign object was located – along the airway or the esophagus. From there we got the red-light treatment via ambulance ? to Texas Children’s Hospital. X-ray showed the spinner bushing lodged in her esophagus. The GI doctor was fascinated…he’d only just learned of fidget spinners that morning when he was at the mall with his son, so it was a surprise to be faced with one in a case a few hours later. He’s also an advocate for related child safety in toys, so he took a special interest in the case. After multiple, very stressful attempts to place an IV, Britton was taken to surgery to endoscopically locate and remove the object. Fortunately we had a positive outcome, but it was pretty scary there for a while…not only because of the initial ingestion, but then the concern about the composition and structure of the object, and finally, the risk with general anesthesia. From this I wish to offer some word of caution to parents. Fidget spinners are the current craze so they are widely distributed. Kids of all ages may be getting them, but not all spinners come with age-appropriate warnings. The bushings pop out easily, so if you have young kids (under 8 yr old) keep in mind that these present a potential choking hazard. [Sidenote: I certainly wasn’t looking for an excuse to tour the brand new Texas Children’s Hospital The Woodlands but this was a pretty effective way. Staff was great and the facility is very nice…but a little quiet on Saturday afternoons.] A spokesperson for the Texas Children’s Hospital confirmed to us that the basic story is true, and that the image of an x-ray showing the object lodged in the girl’s esophagus is authentic. Kelly Rose Joniec’s daughter Britton was indeed taken to the Texas Children’s Hospital at The Woodlands, near Houston, on Saturday 13 May, and did indeed successfully undergo surgery to remove part of a fidget spinner from her esophagus. However, it’s important to note that this incident was not the result of a property or mechanism intrinsic to the fidget spinner itself. Based on Kelly Rose Joniec’s account, it appears that her daughter Britton separated out a part of the toy, and accidentally swallowed it after putting it in her mouth to clean it. The incident does not appear to have happened while the girl was playing with the fidget spinner. Patty Davis, a spokesperson for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, told us that parents should be aware that choking is a hazard with any small toy:  We know these toys are very new and gaining in popularity, and we would encourage parents to think about how their child interacts with toys. Do they mouth items? If that’s the case, then this may not be a toy for them.",0
"Researchers from the University of Essex found that as little as five minutes of a “green activity” such as walking, gardening, cycling or farming can boost mood and self esteem. “We believe that there would be a large potential benefit to individuals, society and to the costs of the health service if all groups of people were to self-medicate more with green exercise,” Barton said in a statement about the study, which was published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Many studies have shown that outdoor exercise can reduce the risk of mental illness and improve a sense of well-being, but Jules Pretty and Jo Barton, who led this study, said that until now no one knew how much time needed to be spent on green exercise for the benefits to show. Barton and Pretty looked at data from 1,252 people of different ages, genders and mental health status taken from 10 existing studies in Britain. They analyzed activities such as walking, gardening, cycling, fishing, boating, horse-riding and farming. They found that the greatest health changes occurred in the young and the mentally ill, although people of all ages and social groups benefited. The largest positive effect on self-esteem came from a five-minute dose of “green exercise.”   All natural environments were beneficial, including parks in towns or cities, they said, but green areas with water appeared to have a more positive effect.",0
"If you are experiencing distress, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit online here. In early June 2019, multiple English-language news outlets, from tabloids to ordinarily reliable national news media, reported that Noa Pothoven, a Dutch teenager and author, had ended her life via euthanasia after asking for and acquiring permission to do so from government officials in the Netherlands. The story, while sensational, was not reported accurately. On 5 June 2019, the Levenseindekliniek, or end-of-life clinic, in the Hague had to release a statement to quell such reports: The End-of-Life Clinic is approached from all over the world for a reaction to the death [of] seventeenth-year-old Noa Pothoven. However, due to privacy rules, we cannot make any statements about this. To put an end to incorrect reporting (in foreign media in particular) about the death, we refer to the statement made by friends of Noa this afternoon: Noa Pothoven did not die of euthanasia. To stop her suffering, she has stopped eating and drinking. The Life-End Clinic deals exclusively with euthanasia and does so explicitly within the Dutch legal framework. As the name and statement of the aforementioned clinic imply, the Netherlands does allow euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide under some circumstances, but that did not occur in the case of Pothoven. It is nnclear is why this story was so widely misreported, because the Dutch language newspaper De Gelderlander reported it accurately. De Gelderlander stated on 2 June 2019 that Pothoven’s sister announced the 17-year-old had died. The paper also reported that six months prior, Pothoven had approached the Levenseindekliniek without her parents’ knowledge and asked if she was eligible for assisted suicide or euthanasia. The answer? “No.” Pothoven was too young, she was reportedly told, and her brain was not fully developed. The source of Pothoven’s anguish was sexual assault: she was raped when she was 11 and 14 years of age, and she suffered from severe psychological disorders including depression and anorexia. Her traumatic journey was made public when she authored a book titled (in English) Winning or Learning. Her last days were spent in a hospital bed in her family’s home saying goodbye to loved ones, according to Dutch news reports. After extensive interventions that included involuntary hospitalization and an induced coma to enable tube-feeding, Pothoven announced in a now-deleted Instagram post that she had made the decision to end her life on her own. Reason monthly magazine observed that the erroneous version of the story resulted in a “strange moral panic” and blank slate upon which “everyone wants to paint their culture war all over.” This is hardly the first time a tragedy originally reported in another language resulted in erroneous or exaggerated news stories in English news media. A questionable story circulated for years on anti-abortion websites claiming that a baby born after a failed abortion was left alone screaming to die. In fact, the tale likely originated with a case in which a baby that could not have survived due to terminal defects was given palliative care at a hospital but was not resuscitated when it died of natural causes.",1
"Tissue samples from two gorillas that died in the forests of northern Rwanda in 2009 were infected with the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) virus, according to The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project. The research also found that the frequency and severity of respiratory disease outbreaks among mountain gorillas straddling Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo was increasing. “We report conclusive evidence for association of a human virus with death in mountain gorillas. Viral RNA in multiple tissue samples from the adult female indicates that she was infected by an HMPV strain at the time of her death,” it said. With a total known world population of 786, the gorillas are one of the region’s biggest tourist attractions. Visitors pay hundreds of dollars to trek through dense forest and get within meters of the great apes. Their numbers have risen by more than a quarter in the last seven years, a sign conservation efforts are paying off although perhaps at a cost. “Although human proximity to mountain gorillas is essential for their conservation, also crucial is minimizing the risk for human-to-great ape transmission of respiratory pathogens,” the report said. “Because there are fewer than 800 living mountain gorillas, each individual is critically important to the survival of their species,” the project’s executive director Mike Cranfield said.",0
"""Democratic pundit Hilary Rosen isn’t buying all the talk about newly re-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie being a moderate Republican. In a roundtable discussion on CNN’s State of the Union, Rosen painted Christie as out of touch when it comes to women’s reproductive issues. """"Women consistently bring Democrats over the top in these purple states,"""" Rosen said during the Nov. 10 show. """"When you look at Chris Christie and you try and take that forward, you’ve got an anti-choice candidate who has vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times over the course of his governorship."""" With four budgets under his belt, did Christie really veto money for Planned Parenthood five times? Rosen tweeted us a story from LifeNews.com, which opposes abortions, and a (Newark) Star-Ledger newspaper editorial that referenced five vetoes. We looked into it ourselves and found Christie has used his executive power several times to deny funding for family planning clinics, including but not exclusively limited to Planned Parenthood. As a result of the cuts at least six clinics have closed, including two affiliated with Planned Parenthood, our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey found. The vetoes have been a real sore spot between the governor and the Democrat-led Legislature since Christie took office. So how many were there exactly? It depends on how you count them. We compiled a timeline using clips from the Star-Ledger and interviews with Planned Parenthood representatives. We could not reach a Christie spokesperson by our deadline. In March 2010, Christie proposed his first budget recommendations amid a $10 billion shortfall with across-the-board cuts, including an $820 million cut for schools. This budget, which outlined Christie’s priorities but still needed approval from the Democratic legislators, also included the elimination of $7.5 million for """"family planning services."""" Legislators then responded by passing a bill to add that funding back in the budget. But Christie struck back. On June 23, 2010, Christie vetoed SB 2139, which aimed to restore $7.5 million in grants for the state’s 58 women’s health and family planning centers, including Planned Parenthood. In his veto letter, Christie cited the state’s budget bind and the existence of other clinics that could perform these services. """"Reproductive health services will continue to be available in each of New Jersey’s 21 counties, including Planned Parenthood clinics, local health department clinics, free standing clinics and hospital-based clinics,"""" he wrote. """"Nearly 95,000 women will still receive care through these family planning sites."""" The Legislature tried again the next year. Again Christie said no. Christie vetoed $7.5 million for the family planning centers in the 2011-12 state budget. Same story in 2012. The Legislature passed a supplemental bill, AB 788, to restore the money for family planning centers, but Christie vetoed it. Lastly, on June 29, 2013, Christie vetoed a measure, SB 2825, from Democrats that again tried to restore the $7.5 million for family planning services. That's four clear vetoes, plus the original cut. Additionally, in 2011 and again in 2013, Christie vetoed proposals to expand the state's Medicaid program to cover family planning services for people who earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Services would have included things such as birth control and cervical exams but not abortion, according to the Star-Ledger. The Medicaid expansion would not have directly provided money for Planned Parenthood, but it """"would have provided a new revenue stream to allow Planned Parenthood health centers to see additional patients and offer additional services, said Ed Remsen, executive director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey. So that could be two additional vetoes, depending on how you count it. Marie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life, pointed out that Christie has maintained funding for other health services and that he defeated a female candidate who made this an issue, suggesting that Rosen’s theory about women not liking Christie rings hollow. Our ruling Rosen said Christie """"vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times over the course of his governorship."""" Rosen is largely correct, though different people might come to a different figure. We rate her claim .""",0
"We’re told that, each year, catheters in hospitals cause 250,000 infections and cost $250 million to treat. That’s important to note and we’re glad it was included. However, the story didn’t tell us how much the intervention costs to implement. But, because this is an intervention that doesn’t have direct consumer costs (unlike, say, a new cancer drug or surgery), we’ll rate this is as N/A. The story attempted to quantify the benefits but missed the mark. What was missing: The chief way to quantify the benefits of such an intervention is to explain, in absolute numbers, how much the infection rate dropped. This can be expressed in terms of “1,000 catheter-days.” In this case, the rate was reduced from 2.28 to 1.54 infections per 1,000 catheter-days in the non-ICU patients. This is a 32% reduction. Use of the catheters themselves was also reduced by the program (which was one of the goals), from 20.1% to 18.8% (1.3% total reduction). Harms aren’t discussed in this story, but improved caretaker education on when and when not to use a catheter, and how to insert one while reducing the risk of infection, doesn’t seem to warrant it. Although there may be some harms from this “bundle,” the study itself was not set up to look for them. We’re not convinced the reader gets a clear enough picture of the study’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, the story didn’t let readers know how many people were enrolled in the study, nor did it point out the lack of a control group, an important limitation in research on quality improvement. We didn’t find any frightening language or graphic depictions of UTIs that would unnecessarily alarm a reader. The writer included comments from Dr. Huang, an editorial writer in NEJM, which suffices as an independent source. But, we’re not told that Dr. Saint — the lead author — is a paid advisory board member for the health services companies Doximity and Jvion. This was probably worth mentioning, since Jvion sells a data product to hospitals “that looks at the patient population and predicts the risk of an illness or condition before symptoms occur” so that “providers are better able to stop hospital acquired conditions, prevent patient suffering and deterioration, target population health activities, and save resources.” The alternative is the status quo, which is discussed in terms of its problems. We’re told the procedure is in use at 600 hospitals, though it would have helped to note they’re spread across 32 states, plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. It could have been made clearer that any hospital can use this safety bundle now that the methods are published widely. The “Stop CAUTI” program has been around for years, but it’s implied that hundreds of hospitals have never implemented it before in a systematic way. The scale and duration of the study makes this novel and worth covering. The story included original quotes, presumably from an interview with Dr. Sanjay Saint. While it does extensively quote a NEJM editorial, those views help put the study and its limitations — e.g. no effect on ICUs, where reducing UTIs could do the most to save lives and reduce suffering — into plain view.",0
"Since California college professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford came forward with sexual assault allegations against President Donald Trump’s second U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, no shortage of rumors and hoaxes has targeted her. One of the many derogatory claims made against Dr. Ford is that she lied when she identified herself as a “research psychologist” during her Senate Judiciary Committee testimony on 27 September 2018. The claim originated with Dangerous.com, a website operated by right wing media personality Milo Yiannopoulos. In an article dated 28 September 2018, the site’s editor-in-chief, Chadwick Moore, reported that Ford “may have told a lie” and “may have perjured herself” when she said she was “a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine” because she didn’t appear to be licensed to practice in California. Thus, Dangerous.com reported, Dr. Ford was in violation of state laws forbidding the false representation of oneself as a psychologist:  Just one sentence into her sworn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford may have told a lie. After thanking members of the committee on Thursday, and while under oath, Ford opened her testimony saying, “My name is Christine Blasey Ford, I am a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University and a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine.” The issue lies with the word “psychologist,” and Ford potentially misrepresenting herself and her credentials, an infraction that is taken very seriously in the psychology field as well as under California law. We found no evidence that Ford lied, perjured herself, or violated California law when she stated her job title. We also asked Moore whether he followed basic journalistic standards in reaching out the California Board of Psychology, consulting an attorney, or attempting to contact Ford’s attorneys before publishing his report but did not receive a response. Ford holds a doctorate in psychology from the University of Southern California, which she received on 20 August 1996. She also earned two master’s degrees: one in 1991 from Pepperdine University in clinical psychology, and the other in 2009 from Stanford University School of Medicine in epidemiology. Aside from her research role at Stanford, she is a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University. But because Moore was unable to find Ford’s name listed on a public database of licensed psychologists in California, he concluded Ford had violated California Business and Professions Code section 2903 (a), which states that “No person may engage in the practice of psychology, or represent himself or herself to be a psychologist, without a license granted under this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.” The code does provide an exemption that would cover Ford as a university researcher, however. California Board of Psychology assistant executive officer Jeffrey Thomas told us that the title “psychologist” is indeed protected, meaning that it is against the law to falsely represent oneself as a psychologist without proper certification. But the law does allow those who work at research institutions to state their professional role so long as they note that it is specific to the facility at which they are employed. Thomas pointed us to California Business and Professions Code section 2909, which reads as follows: This chapter shall not be construed as restricting or preventing activities of a psychological nature or the use of the official title of the position for which they were employed on the part of the following persons, provided those persons are performing those activities as part of the duties for which they were employed, are performing those activities solely within the confines of or under the jurisdiction of the organization in which they are employed, and do not render or offer to render psychological services, as defined in Section 2903: (a) Persons who hold a valid and current credential as a school psychologist issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. (b) Persons who are employed in positions as psychologists or psychological assistants by accredited or approved colleges, junior colleges, or universities, or by federal, state, county, or municipal governmental organizations that are not primarily involved in the provision of direct health or mental health services, may conduct research and disseminate their research findings and scientific information. Moore noted that Ford’s job title on the web site for Stanford University School of Medicine appeared to have changed from “research psychologist” to “affiliate” at some point after the Kavanaugh controversy broke, adding to his suspicion that she had misrepresented herself. But it’s unclear whether his assumption was true that Stanford “caught the blunder and edited Ford’s faculty page.” (We reached out multiple times to Stanford media relations staff but received no answer.) However, Dr. Ford has been identified as a research psychologist in university literature as far back as 2003 and up to at least 10 September 2018. We have reached out to Ford’s attorneys, Debra Katz and Michael Bromwich, with questions about Ford’s employment status with Stanford, whether she has any clinical licenses in California under a different name or in any other state, or whether they could comment on allegations she “perjured” herself during her Senate committee testimony but have not yet received a response. However, perjury is defined as knowingly making false statements under oath, so it’s unclear how Ford’s relaying of a job title conferred upon her by her employer could possibly meet that criterion. After publication of this article, Dangerous.com erred yet again in attempting to explain away their previous mistake by claiming that California Business and Professions Code Section 2910 applied to Dr. Ford:  Moore also acknowledged Section 2909 in his original report, and pointed to the fact that the overwhelming majority of academics who do work of a psychological nature are not licensed, and this is perfectly fine and legal. But Moore pointed to the following section of the law, Section 2910 of the same Code, which reads, very explicitly, “This chapter shall not be construed to restrict the practice of psychology on the part of persons who are salaried employees of accredited or approved academic institutions, public schools, or governmental agencies, if those employees are complying with the following: (3) Do not hold themselves out to the public by any title or description of activities incorporating the words “psychology,” “psychological,” or “psychologist.”  Dangerous.com apparently failed to notice (or willfully ignored) that this section of the code specifically refers to, and regulates, the practice of psychology, not the use of the word “psychologist” in a job title. Section 2910 allows persons who are “salaried employees of accredited or approved academic institutions” to gain “the supervised professional experience required for licensure,” as long as that experience is “being accrued consistent with the board’s regulations,” and those persons “have as the primary supervisor a psychologist licensed in the state” and “do not hold themselves out to the public by any title … incorporating the word ‘psychology,’ ‘psychological,’ or ‘psychologist. '” In other words, Section 2910 establishes conditions under which budding psychologists employed by schools and government agencies may obtain practical experience on their way to becoming fully licensed psychologists. As Dr. Ford is a research psychologist who is not seeking a license and does not engage in the practice of psychology as part of her job duties, Section 2910 is not applicable to her situation or job title. We spoke with Antonette Sorrick, Executive Officer for the California Board of Psychology, who concurred with our analysis that Section 2909, not 2910, is the relevant section of code that applies to Dr. Ford’s situation.",1
"Residents like Marina Ortiz listen out for the regular sound of the community recycling truck. Standing by her door, she rushes out into the street, bringing her food waste to the collectors. “When I cook I separate out the remains of the vegetables. The paper and cardboard I give to the collectors, and the food to the vegetables truck,” the 58-year-old housewife said. “The people from the municipality taught us and I’ve been doing it for years. They tell me that later all the waste is turned into earth.”  The municipality of La Pintana now collects 140 tons of plant waste from homes every week, far higher than comparable neighborhoods. That is despite the area having some of the worst socioeconomic indicators in Chile. There are few medical centers and almost no companies or major employers. The news that comes from the area is almost always related to drug trafficking, delinquency and violence. The poverty rate – at around 42% of the 177,000 inhabitants – is far above the national 17% average, a legacy of the area receiving poor families displaced from other richer parts of the capital during the 1973-1990 military dictatorship. “The people of La Pintana have been treated harshly by the state, with no services, no health facilities, no education. There are children in the street, crimes, a lot of inequality,” La Pintana mayor Claudia Pizarro told Reuters. “But this is one of the good things that exist in the community, and we’re a pioneer in this area. We have made efforts to be recognized as a community that takes care of the environment,” she added. Chile, already an environmental leader in Latin America for its use of renewable energy and creation of national parks, is looking to roll out further initiatives as it gears up to host the major COP25 global conference on climate change in December. These include reducing consumption of single-use plastics, trying to cut emissions and increasing the recycling rate. The environment ministry has recently set targets for the recycling of paper, plastics and glass. La Pintana, however, remains a stand-out case. “There is no one who has done this with the level of penetration and perfection that La Pintana has,” said Gonzalo Muñoz, an environmental ‘champion’ for the COP25 in Chile. “It’s surprising that other municipalities have not copied it.”   The process has an economic as well as an environmental benefit, since it reduces the amount of garbage residents send to the landfill, which charges to receive it. “We started in 2005 looking for a way to generate savings to reduce our spending on waste management,” said Felipe Marchant, head of La Pintana’s environmental management division. “It’s the biggest financial burden of the municipalities.”   Carol Valdebenito, an engineer who has worked as an environmental educator in the area for seven years, said it also  brought the community together. “The neighbors not only talk to us about environmental things, but about social issues, their problems and concerns,” she told Reuters as she walked alongside the green recycling truck through pot-holed streets roamed by groups of stray dogs. The trucks deposit the waste at a composting and vermiculture plant, where the garbage slowly transforms into piles of dark earth with a musty odor, full of long, pink worms that do a lot of the work processing the waste. This becomes fertilizer for the nearby municipal nursery, where trees are grown for the green areas of the community. The nursery also researches which species adapt best to climate change and dry weather. “That is the basic concept of what is called the circular economy,” said Marchant.",0
"Not applicable. Readers should know the lost cost of aspirin. The story said that aspirin users were 29% less likely to develop pancreatic cancer than those who used other types of pain relievers or nothing at all. But what was that baseline rate? It’s impossible for readers to judge the scope of the potential benefits when given just the 29% figure. 29% of what? All the story said was that aspirin “carries some side effects.” It never explained what they are nor how often they may occur. Even one additional line in the story could have done this. While the story explained that such a study can’t establish cause and effect, it nonethless still used language suggesting possible beneficial effects: www.healthnewsreview.org/tips-for-understanding-studies.php#tip4 The language used to describe observational studies is important to avoid misleading readers. And it doesn’t take much to make these changes. See our primer. The story also never addressed the limitations of drawing conclusions based on talks at scientific meetings, which have not undergone rigorous peer review. We have a primer on that topic as well. Not applicable only because the story really didn’t give any background on pancreatic cancer, so it couldn’t have disease mongered. No independent source is quoted. We’re really not given any context or background about pancreatic cancer in this short, 320-word story. And we certainly didn’t learn of any other research into ways to prevent pancreatic cancer. Not applicable. The availability of aspirin is not in question. We’re not given any context about whether this is the first and only research that looked at this question. It appears that the story was based solely on a news release, since the researcher quote comes from a news release. And no independent source is cited.",1
"""There was no discussion of the costs associated with prostate cancer screening. However, as the cessation of routine prostate cancer screening for men over the age of 75 was the new recommendation by the task force, cost is not really germane to the discussion. It might have been helpful to include some mention of the potential costs to screening older men and/or cost saving with cessation of screening older men. There are those that are going to interpret the recommendation against routine screening as a cost saving effort. The story outlined for readers that the benefits of routine screening for prostate cancer are uncertain. Without quantifying the frequency, the story mentioned the common side effects of treatment for prostate cancer. The story attempted to explain the conundrum of prostate cancer, prostate cancer treatment, and routine prostate cancer screening. It included numbers indicating that the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer is far in excess of the number who die of prostate cancer. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. It put the natural history of most prostate cancers into appropriate context. The story included comments from a number of individuals with relevant expertise. The story did not do an adequate job of indicating whether those quoted served on the recommendation task force other than for Ned Calonge, who was mentioned as chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force. The story was about the new recommendation regarding routine screening of men older than 75 years of age with PSA test;  the story presented arguments for and against the use of the test. The story mentioned that it was about routine screening of men for prostate cancer. As the story lead with """"The blood test that millions of men undergo each year"""", it accurately indicated that this test is readily available. The story was reporting on the release of new guidelines from the US Preventive Services task force, and highlighted that these recommendations differ from the previous version in that they specify that the benefit of routine screening of men older than 75 years of age for prostate cancer is little to none while at the same time, the harms are moderate-to-substantial. Does not  rely exclusively on a press release as it includes numerous quotes from a variety of experts with differing view points.""",0
"There was no mention of costs in this story although the costs of some antihypertensive drugs can be moderately high. Neither did the story disclose that study participants received vouchers for monthly haircuts as well as a small monetary payment to offset the costs of drugs and transportation as enticements to continue with the program, information that was contained in the journal paper but excluded in the story. Regardless, we don’t believe that information is that important to readers in this case so we’ll rate this category as non-applicable. The story clearly states that men in the intervention group experienced a much greater reduction in their blood pressure readings as compared to the control group. It included this quantified statement, “It turned out that, when the guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure level of less than 130/80 was achieved among 63.6% of men who participated in the study’s program, versus 11.7% of those who didn’t.” This was a tough one to rate. On one hand, It is hard to envision harms arising from men participating in what appeared to be a safe screening and treatment program for high blood pressure. On the other, the journal paper about this study reported that three individuals experienced acute kidney injury, although that problem disappeared once medications were altered. So, there are risks, and the story would have been stronger had it included them. This was a strong point of the story. It explains that the research compared the results of an interventional group with those of a control group of matched participants and barber shops. It also points out several limitations to the study which readers can consider when evaluating the worth of this research. No disease mongering here. The story includes comments from both a barber-participant in the study and a researcher unconnected to this project. We did not detect any conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed. The story explained the alternative–not receiving special help at the barbershop–and what the outcomes were. It also discussed similar past efforts to help black men at risk of colon cancer. Perhaps more could have been said about the effectiveness rates of other public health programs, but we feel this wasn’t critical. The story makes clear that this research was conducted in the Los Angeles area and cautions that a national study would be needed to show the approach’s applicability in other locales. Readers would not assume that this kind of health care assistance was available in black-owned barber shops elsewhere. The story does a good job discussing this study in the context of previous research, which has involved the use of barber shops and beauty salons as places where patrons might be receptive to health messages. This does not appear to rely on a news release.",0
"Claims about possums and ticks are mostly true — but the amount of ticks one possum kills in a week has been skewed. An “Awesome Possum” meme, as it has become known, was posted at the image-sharing community website FunnyJunk.com in mid-March. Within days, it had been shared thousands of times on Facebook, and the legend of the Awesome Possum was born: INSERT PIC The idea is that even though possums are scary looking scavengers that prowl in the night for animal carcasses to feed on, they actually serve an important purpose: preventing the spread of Lyme disease by “hoovering up and killing” up to 4,000 ticks a week, each. As it turns out, there’s scientific evidence to support the “Awesome Possum” claim. It comes from Richard Ostfeld of the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. The Cary Institute reports: And now ecologists have learned something else about opossums. They’re a sort of magnet when it comes to riding the world of black-legged ticks, which spread Lyme disease. “Don’t hit opossums if they’ve playing dead in the road,” said Richard Ostfeld, of the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. Ostfeld is forest ecologist and an expert on the environmental elements of infectious diseases like Lyme disease. Several years ago, scientists decided to learn about the part different mammals play in the spread of the ticks and the disease. They tested six species — white-footed mice, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums and veerys and catbirds — by capturing and caging them, and then exposing each test subject to 100 ticks. What they found, is that of the six, the opossums were remarkably good at getting rid of the ticks — much more so that any of the others. “I had no suspicion they’d be such efficient tick-killing animals,” Ostfeld said. Indeed, among other opossum traits, there is this: They groom themselves fastidiously, like cats. If they find a tick, they lick it off and swallow it. (The research team on the project went through droppings to find this out. All praise to those who study possum poop.) Extrapolating from their findings, Ostfeld said, the team estimated that in one season, an opossum can kill about 5,000 ticks. So, it’s true that ticks are very good at removing and eating ticks — but not quite as good as the Awesome Possum meme claims. Researchers estimated that one possum could kill about 5,000 ticks in one season — not 4,000 ticks in one year. And the idea that possums stop the spread of Lyme disease is based on a simple cause-and-effect theory: possums help stop the spread of Lyme disease by killing ticks, which carry the disease. That’s why we’re calling this one mostly true. Comments",0
"Although the hair test is far from ready for any practical, clinical use, the story speculates that it could be a tool to identify children at risk. If it’s not too soon to make such predictions, it’s not too soon to give readers an idea of what the test might cost. The magnitude of the correlation or association between cortisol and traumatic events was not mentioned, and it is very small. As per the scientific article, the history of traumatic events accounts for only 5 to 13% of the variance in the cortisol levels; the biggest effect on those levels was male or female sex, with boys having about two times higher levels than girls. So many, many other factors are influencing cortisol levels besides these reports of traumatic events. None were mentioned. The other side of the early identification/screening coin is that labeling a child with a mental illness early on and with minimal evidence also has adverse effects with regards to self-image and development. The worst problem with this article is that it makes the classic mistake of jumping to the conclusion that because of the association found, the cortisol test may be used to predict future disease. This goes far beyond the data and we cringed at the headline. The sample size (14 boys and 56 girls) is far too small to even suggest this has some hope of being a diagnostic or screening test. The study authors even admit in their paper that the sample is disappointingly small and a lot more work has to be done to prove the hair-cortisol test’s veracity. The sample included mostly girls because they tended to have more hair to snip from. We also question how good the reported history of traumatic events is, in that it is based on questionnaires to parents. As is a problem for all retrospective studies like this, memories are not perfect, and we would think that some parents would be reluctant to reveal some types of trauma such as physical abuse, witnessing of domestic abuse, and sexual abuse. There’s a big difference between those types of trauma and, for example, moving one’s home or having a skateboard accident and breaking your ankle (or worse). Also, the scientific article notes that no correlation was found with current depressive symptoms and the hair cortisol level, which may not bode well for their overall theory that the cortisol may predict future mental health problems. None. There are no conflicts of interest as determined from the authors’ disclosures in the published study. But the story quotes only the first author of the study in the article, and would have done well to get opinions of the work from at least one independent source. It’s pretty unfortunate that the story did not get an outside perspective, given the nature of the article and its claims. Alternatives to testing cortisol levels in hair were mentioned — as in saliva and blood. Alternatives regarding ways to identify children at risk would seem to abound and likely explain much more than any lab test ever will. For example, kids who come from homes where they aren’t provided with adequate food, from parents with mental health problems, etc. (sociological/environmental variables). We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here but it’s really only a partial Satisfactory. Again, since the story speculates aggressively about the clinical usefulness of this test, we’d like to see some information about how widely available it is. Is this a highly specialized test available only to researchers? Could consumers request such tests from any lab? Such context is important to help readers understand the impact of this research. The news article didn’t give any idea of how novel the research is. Apparently from the scientific article, no prior studies have tried to look at history of past traumatic events and correlate with cortisol levels. Even the hair test, as late as 2016, is described as “relatively new” by the researchers, especially in kids (hair tests for cortisol in adults go back quite a few years). Other background with regard to studies using hair and cortisol and mental illness were reviewed in the scientific article and the Guardian story might have provided a bit more background. We couldn’t find any evidence of any news release about this study. However, because there are no independent sources quoted, we can’t be sure that the story didn’t rely on such a news release that we weren’t able to find (e.g. one that may have been emailed to reporters). The best the story can score here is Not Applicable.",1
"Authorities this week said they were investigating 27 cases of infection after rumors on social media suggested the outbreak could be linked to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The World Health Organization said it was aware of the reports, is monitoring the situation and is in contact with the Chinese government about it. “Investigations are still being carried out and authorities cannot yet confirm what pathogen is causing this illness,” said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. He added that there are several  potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than SARS. Chinese municipal health officials in Wuhan said in a statement on their website on Friday that they had ruled out common respiratory diseases, such as influenza, bird flu and adenovirus infection, as the cause. Eleven of those infected were in critical condition and the rest stable, they said, adding that all had been isolated and doctors were observing 121 people with whom they had been in close contact. Clean-up efforts at a seafood market where some victims were vendors have been completed, the city officials said, adding that no obvious human-to-human transmission had been seen and no medical staff had been infected. On Friday, Singapore’s health ministry said it would begin temperature screening on passengers arriving on flights from Wuhan. In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced the government to reveal the epidemic, apologize and vow full candour regarding future outbreaks. The disease, which emerged in southern China late in 2002, spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died. Wuhan police this week said they had summoned eight people who “posted and forwarded false information online, causing adverse social impact”.",0
"""The story says that each machine """"costs as much as $300,000."""" It does not provide a per-treatment cost, which would have been nice. It does say, though, that """"Medicare doesn’t specifically pay for use of the NanoKnife, though hospitals and doctors get reimbursement under more general medical-treatment billing codes. Some private insurers, including Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield, decline to cover its use because of the lack of """"scientific evidence of effectiveness in improving health outcomes."""""""" As with the harms, it is difficult to quantify the benefits because of the lack of evidence. Here we think the story relies a little too much on anecdotal evidence. On balance, the story presents a complete picture, though. Because of the lack of evidence, it is difficult to quantify the harms. But the story did a nice job of addressing the harms. """"Some side effects have been reported. Because the device uses large electrical bursts, it can trigger fast heartbeats. Four such cases out of about three dozen patients were described in a recent report by Ken Thomson, a radiologist in Melbourne, Australia. AngioDynamics says that these cases have all been treatable and that the company has taken technical steps to minimize such future occurrences. One case reported to the FDA was of a U.S. patient who in July suffered a serious hemothorax, or blood buildup between the chest wall and lungs. The patient had to stay in the hospital for 16 days, and doctors said an artery """"most likely"""" was punctured during the operation. AngioDynamics said in the FDA report that such a puncture is a """"possible complication"""" of any such operation."""" This is more detail than is provided in most stories, even when there is much more evidence available. The entire reason for this story is to evaluate the disconnect between the claims being made for these machines and the lack of evidence to support those claims. It does a great job walking readers through the way the machine is supposed to work, the health benefit claims and the paucity of credible evidence for the machine’s benefits. One quibble: AngioDynamics says that the machine has been tested in """"small number of human patients"""". What were the results? Why does the company think the results are promising? This story does not engage in disease-mongering. The story quotes a number of outside experts, including Riad Salem, chief of interventional oncology at Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital; Ken Thomson, a radiologist in Australia who studied the devices; and  Tim Clark, director of interventional radiology at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia. Importantly, the story also makes the distinction between the claims the company is making and the claims being made by the clinics and hospitals who have bought the machines (and are trying to recoup their investments.) It quotes the CEO of the machine manufacturer saying, """"We are not part of the whole PR machine. It’s not something we are happy about."""" The story does not do a very good job of contrasting this treatment with other treatments. This is disappointing because one of the claims made by the manufacturer’s CEO is: """"We think this is a very promising technology for treating cancer that is otherwise untreatable."""" Some specifics about those cancers and how they are otherwise treated would have been nice. Because the NanoKnife has not been compared to a more traditional surgical approach, the benefits of the new technology are hard to define. Unfortunately the story relies on a biased statement by the CEO of the manufacturer as its sole comparator. The story says that the NanoKnife is """"currently being used in about 13 U.S. hospitals including Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock, Ark., University of Louisville, and Shands Hospital/University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla."""" It later says, """"The NanoKnife, which is also available in five hospitals outside the U.S., has so far been used to treat about 300 cancer patients world-wide."""" The story  makes it clear that similar devices have been used for other procedures, but that this is a relatively new therapy for cancer. This story does not rely on a news release.""",0
"A long-circulating military rumor maintains that individuals with a high net worth (a million dollars in this iteration) are prohibited from serving due to a supposed propensity for refusing orders:  My colleague works remotely from Japan, as her husband is stationed there. I’m not sure which branch of the U.S. military he serves in, but she stated that if you have a net worth of one million dollars, you are not allowed to serve because people with a high net worth also tend to refuse orders. Is this true? I’ve never heard that before and can’t find anything about it on the web. It’s certainly unambiguous that the majority of active servicemen and women are of modest means. While many now-wealthy folks once served, individuals who’ve abandoned lucrative careers or opportunities (or were born into money) often so rarely opt to serve that such a scenario is newsworthy. However, examples to the contrary remain, one being Senator John McCain’s son James McCain: Mr. McCain did not bring cameras or a retinue. Instead, he brought his youngest son, James McCain, 19, then a private first class in the Marine Corps about to leave for Iraq … Mr. McCain, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has staked his candidacy on the promise that American troops can bring stability to Iraq. What [Sen. McCain] almost never says is that one of them is his own son, who spent seven months patrolling Anbar Province and learned of his father’s New Hampshire victory in January while he was digging a stuck military vehicle out of the mud. Further back in history, all four of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.’s sons served in the military despite the family’s wealth: Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. was killed in action in August 1944, President John F. Kennedy was awarded a Purple Heart for heroic actions in the same year, Senator Ted Kennedy enlisted in 1951, and Robert F. Kennedy enlisted in 1944 six weeks before his eighteenth birthday. None circumvented active duty despite their families’ wealth and fame. Clear examples to the contrary regarding wealth and eligibility to serve contradict claims that net worth is an absolute barrier to service due to a high likelihood of insubordination. A similar rumor was addressed in a 20 July 2010 Stars and Stripes column titled “Can winning the lottery get you out of the service?” Although the question addressed in that item didn’t directly pertain to eligibility to serve, it did confirm the existence of scenarios in which newly acquired wealth disrupted a military career: Seaman Don Burdette was one of thousands of sailors aboard the USS Nimitz in 2004. But he was the only one to win millions. And after Burdette hit the California lottery for a $6.5 million payday, it was only a matter of days before the Navy bid him bon voyage. The Rumor Doctor came upon Burdette’s story after a reader downrange asked if it is possible to be discharged after winning a big jackpot. The Doctor scoffed at first, having shot down many ridiculous notions, but it turns out that all the services have some type of system in place that would allow the nouveau riche to slip off their boots and begin a new life. Burdette had served more than two years of a four-year contract at the time. He asked his division chief and others what he should do. They suggested he take the money and sail away. It took about a week-and-a-half to process his request for an honorable discharge, which ultimately had to be approved by his captain … Marines who win the lottery can request an early discharge due to “unique circumstances,” said Marine Corps spokeswoman Maj. Shawn Haney. However, the scenario described didn’t involve a question of eligibility to serve, merely a situation where wealth arose as a factor in the trajectory of a military career. That article also noted that sudden infusions of wealth were a potential distraction of which the military wasn’t unaware, making such discharges perhaps best for all involved (again, in scenarios where individuals received unexpected windfalls in the course of service): And it just makes good sense, said Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Paul Rhynard, who believes it’s unreasonable to expect a Coast Guardsman who recently won the lottery to perform his duties the same as before. The Coast Guard no longer has any leverage over him, Rhynard said. “He’s not worried about whether he loses his job or not,” Rhynard said. Further supporting information can be found in military forms pertaining to requests for discharge following a “once in a lifetime opportunity”: This provision of AR 635-200 provides for those soldiers who desire to leave active duty but who do not qualify under any other provision of AR 635-200. Recent guidance (MILPER Message NR 97-095) emphasizes that requests under this provision will not be approved unless discharge is clearly “in the best interests of the Army,” not necessarily in the best interests of the soldier. Individual requests which serve only the interest of the soldier, particularly those involving soldiers with critical military skills or bonus recipients, will not be approved except under exceptional circumstances. Requests for separation more than three months before ETS normally will be disapproved. So while branches of the service were aware of and provided for scenarios in which an individual’s sudden wealth placed their continued enlistment at odds with the best interests of the military, we could locate no specific provision barring wealthy individuals from serving, due to probable insubordination or otherwise. It appeared to be true that servicemen or women who encountered a windfall could under some circumstances be relieved of their obligation to serve, but the request seemed to be most often triggered by the individual and not their relevant military branch. It’s possible the rumor was a byproduct of the idea such continued service was not in the “best interests” of the military, but that specific wording was derived from a protocol related to new wealth, not existing high net worth.",1
"""Jan. 22 marked the 37th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which protects a woman's qualified right to terminate her pregnancy. In honor of the occasion, the Republican Party of Texas linked Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White to what it called a """"gigantic abortion mill"""" in Houston. We saw the claim in an e-mail the party distributed last week: """"In Houston, former mayor and now Democratic contender for governor Bill White has presided over the construction of what may be the world's largest abortion clinic. White bills himself as a moderate Democrat, but his administration allowed this 6-floor, 78,000 square foot facility to be built."""" In its e-mail, the GOP added a dramatic kicker: """"And there's more to this awful story: White's director of Health Policy was one Elena Marks. Ms. Marks is (or was) also the Texas head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Bill White's connection to this gigantic abortion mill is undeniable; he holds no claim to being a moderate Democrat."""" That's quite an indictment. Is it true? Katy Bacon, White's campaign spokeswoman, said: """"Bill White had nothing to do with a Planned Parenthood facility."""" Bryan Preston, communications director for the state party, said: """"It happened under his watch, and he had someone working with him in his administration that he appointed that is closely connected to Planned Parenthood."""" What we found: This March, Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, which opened more than 75 years ago, plans to move from its current location to a building it began refurbishing in 2008 with $17 million in private donations. The seven-story, 78,000-square-foot former Sterling Bank building on Houston's Gulf Freeway will be the biggest Planned Parenthood facility in the United States, according to Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Rochelle Tafolla. The new facility includes a surgical suite that will provide the same services that the current location has offered since 1973. Currently, the clinic performs about 20 abortions per day. Tafolla said more than 90 percent of the clinic's services relate to preventative care, such as breast exams and cervical cancer screening. The city issued Planned Parenthood a demolition permit to begin the project in 2008, and several building permits since for various aspects of the construction, Tafolla said. However, the mayor has no role in approving such permits, said Janice Evans, director of communications for Houston Mayor Annise Parker, White's successor. Evans said: """"We have thousands of building permits, they do not come to (the) city council."""" Andy Icken, Houston's deputy director of public works, said his department reviewed Planned Parenthood's application for building permits to make sure they complied with the city's building code. Icken also said that nobody from the mayor's office interfered with the application process. According to the Houston Department of Health and Human Services, facilities seeking to perform abortions apply to the state Department of State Health Services to be licensed in Texas. City officials do not sign off on whether facilities can perform abortions. What about Elena Marks, White's then-director of health and environmental policy? Did she play a role in getting city approval for the facility? Marks didn't return our phone calls, though we confirmed separately that Marks served on the board of directors for Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas from 1993-2004. In 2007, Marks joined the national board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which doesn't supervise local affiliates but sets general policy for the entire organization, according to Tait Sye, a federation spokesman. Marks previously was the board chair of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the PAC for the national organization. Contrary to the GOP's claim, Marks was never the Texas head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America; the position doesn't exist. Since 2001, Marks has personally donated about $3,500 to Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas. Her latest donation was in March 2007, according to a search of campaign finance records kept by the Texas Ethics Commission. We found no evidence that Marks used her official position to ensure approval of the building permits. This much is true: White was mayor when Planned Parenthood started renovating a building to become its new facility. Using the GOP's logic, White also """"presided"""" over Hurricane Katrina and the Houston Astros going to the World Series and countless other coincidental events. But as far as we could tell, White was no more responsible for the Planned Parenthood construction than he controlled the weather, baseball playoffs or other non-mayoral events. We rate the Texas GOP's claim ridiculously . This story was updated to correct the number of abortions Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas performs each week to 20 per day.""",1
"The company Varela works for, Fotmer Life Sciences, has just made the first commercial shipment of medical cannabis from Latin America, 10 kg (22 lb) of dried flowers with high levels of active ingredient THC destined for patients in Australia. The small but landmark export underscores the country’s push into the burgeoning market for legal cannabis, that has medical uses including helping cancer patients manage chronic pain or treating spasms associated with multiple sclerosis. “Our goal is to create a billion-dollar industry here in Uruguay in the next five to seven years,” Jordan Lewis, chief executive of Fotmer Life Sciences, told Reuters at the Montevideo lab. The firm soon hopes to announce shipments to the European Union, where Germany is the key market, he added. Uruguay has been ahead of the curve. It was the first country to legalize the growing, sale and smoking of marijuana in December 2013 in a pioneering social experiment closely watched by other nations debating drug liberalization. The number of countries legalizing the use of medical cannabis is expected to almost double to around 80 in the future, Lewis said, “creating a potential (global) market of $100 billion in the next ten years.”  In the coming weeks the firm will begin exporting 100 kg  each month of dried flowers and cannabis extracts, Lewis said. The potential is clear. While market forecasts range widely, advisory and investment bank Cowen Inc predicts the U.S. cannabis market alone could be worth $80 billion by 2030. In the company’s facilities, in a science park complex 21 km (13 miles) from Montevideo’s center, Varela’s team of scientists are taking things seriously. To get into the white-walled labs, visitors must wear plastic cloth shoes, a tunic, cap, mask and latex gloves. Varela says it is vital to control the quality of the environment for the cannabis plants, especially given the high global standards needed for making medicines as well as in the handling of agricultural products. Each plant has a number and bar code, part of system to track the production process and catch possible genetic issues. There were 350 marijuana plants growing and 27 different genetic varieties when Reuters visited. The plants once ready are transferred to 18 industrial-size greenhouses in Nueva Helvecia, 120 km away, equipped with drying, curing and packaging machinery. Varela, a biochemist, got interested in studying the uses of cannabis while doing a doctorate in the Netherlands. When he returned to Uruguay, he joined one of the early projects being done by Uruguayan Fernando Sassón along with American Lewis. Uruguay’s support for the industry has put it at the forefront of the growing global market, he said. “As we see legalization happening at a global and regional level, Uruguay is pushing ahead to develop highly-qualified people with the right skills really quickly.”",0
"""As graphic images emerged from Virginia over the weekend of a car crashing into a crowd of people, some turned their attention to a proposed North Carolina law that aims to protect drivers who inadvertently injure protesters in the street. House Bill 330 was introduced in response to protests in Charlotte last fall, when some residents who were upset about the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott blocked interstate highways and other roads in the city. The N.C. House of Representatives approved the bill this spring but it hasn’t been considered by the state Senate. The bill drew renewed scrutiny after an Ohio man named James Fields, 20, allegedly rammed his car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. The car killed one woman and injured 19 others. The news sparked fears that drivers in North Carolina could hit protesters without legal repercussions. On Tuesday, Gov. Roy Cooper called for legislators to let the bill die. """"The North Carolina legislature should defeat a bill that grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters. That bill passed the state House and remains alive in the Senate. The Senate should kill it. Full stop. Those who attack protesters, weaponizing their vehicles like terrorists, should find no safe haven in our state."""" he wrote. We wondered whether the bill really """"grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters,"""" as Cooper said. A ‘tightly tailored’ bill? Cooper spokesman Ford Porter elaborated on the governor’s statement in an email. """"The purpose of the bill is to immunize certain drivers from findings of liability. Courts already take into consideration the circumstances surrounding an accident – this legislation adds vague new protections specifically for people who hit protesters with their cars,"""" Porter said. """"That sends the wrong message and opens the door to potentially serious consequences. Governor Cooper has been clear that our state has no business going down this path."""" The bill’s authors, Republican state Reps. Justin Burr and Chris Millis, released a statement saying the bill is """"tightly tailored"""" to protect drivers as well as people who are lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. """"It is intellectually dishonest and a gross mischaracterization to portray North Carolina House Bill 330 as a protection measure for the act of violence that occurred in Charlottesville this past weekend,"""" Burr and Millis said. """"Any individual who committed a deliberate or willful act, such as what happened this weekend in Charlottesville, would face appropriately severe criminal and civil liabilities."""" What the bill says The one-page bill, which is short by legislative standards, aims to provide legal immunity from personal-injury lawsuits to motorists who exercise """"due care"""" when driving but injure someone who blocks traffic while participating in a protest. The bill expresses important distinctions: it wouldn’t apply to drivers who injure protesters through """"willful or wanton"""" actions; nor would it apply to drivers who injure someone who has a permit to protest in the street. It also wouldn’t apply to someone being criminally prosecuted. And it certainly wouldn’t allow drivers to """"weaponize"""" their cars without legal consequence. In short, the bill doesn't grant immunity to anyone who hits a protester on purpose. What it changes Attorneys and legal experts doubt that the bill would have much impact because state laws already offer broad protections to drivers who accidentally hit people who are unlawfully in the street. In North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama and Maryland, state law makes it difficult for a plaintiff to win. Other states apply the doctrine of """"comparative fault."""" Let’s say a protester in a comparative fault state is found to be 20 percent responsible for his or her injury and a driver is found to be 80 percent at fault. State laws in those states merely limit – not block – the amount of money awarded to the protester. In North Carolina, by contrast, state laws apply the doctrine of """"contributory negligence."""" If a defendant proves """"that the Plaintiff is even 1 percent responsible for their injuries – they lose automatically,"""" said T. Greg Doucette, a criminal defense and business litigation attorney based in Durham. Doucette said the effect of the bill is unknown because it’s untested. But, on the bill’s surface, it seems to change little about civil litigation. Proving intent If the bill were to pass, how would it play out in court? If a protester is in the street and doesn’t have a permit, but thinks a driver intentionally struck him with his car, the protester would have to prove """"willful and wanton"""" intent. Donald Beskind, a Duke University professor who’s practiced law for more than 30 years, said juries in that kind of situation are asked to consider direct and circumstantial evidence. Most cases are clear cut, he said. """"If you want to know if someone was careful, you would want to look at what they were doing at the time of the accident. If they were texting, we would infer they were not careful,"""" Beskind said. If someone drove into protesters and """"on the back side of their car there was a sign that said ‘Kill the Antifa,’ we would assume they were being willful,"""" he added, referring to the anti-fascist political organization. Inspiring recklessness? Effectiveness or ineffectiveness aside, attorneys said the bill might inspire violent acts by people who don’t understand the laws. """"While I don’t think it would make the Charlottesville thing legal by any stretch of the imagination, it could embolden someone to do something like the Charlottesville guy did,"""" said David Stradley, a personal injury lawyer in Raleigh. """"We just don’t need to be encouraging people to do something around a demonstration."""" Our ruling Cooper overstates what this bill would do. And legal experts say that, while untested, the bill doesn't appear to change litigation and might not offer any additional protections at all.""",1
"Given the statistics on the incidence of osteoarthritis of the knee provided in the release, the cost of viscosupplementation is important. The costs of the material (technically, hyaluronic acid derivatives are medical devices) varies depending on which is chosen but costs range between $300 to $500 per injection. Since osteoarthritis of the knee is a chronic condition, the durability of the injection is an important aspect of costs. Clinical trials suggest that when it is effective, the duration is varied ranging from weeks to up to six months. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons web page, an organization that does not specifically endorse viscosupplementation, “If the injections are effective they may be repeated after a period of time, usually 6 months.” The release is nearly silent on the quantification of benefits of viscosupplementation. It does state, “AMSSM RECOMMENDS viscosupplementation injections for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade II-III knee osteoarthritis in those patients above the age of 60 based on HIGH quality evidence demonstrating benefit using OMERACT-OARSI Responder Rating but the evidence should be downgraded due to indirectness for those under 60 years of age.” What exactly is the high quality evidence? How is it determined? Does it include functional as well and pain levels in the assessment? The reader is simply advised this is high quality evidence. There is also no mention of the longevity of any benefits from viscosupplementation. Does the lubrication, if it has a positive effect, last months or years? How many? There is also little in the way of qualification. Who best qualifies for this treatment? To its credit the release does note that this recommendation appears to fly in the face of all of the evidence from clinical trials. This fact is underscored by a statement from the first author, “We do not treat groups of people we treat individuals,” said Dr. Thomas Trojian, Lead Author and Past AMSSM Board of Director.” Randomized clinical trials are the recognized gold standard for medical interventions. Trials are designed to look at populations and not at individuals per se. All of these clinical trials are likely to have a group of responders to the intervention. In the case of failed trials, the group represents a subset. Since some people received a benefit, but the majority did not, this doesn’t seem like sound ground to stand on. It seems intuitive that injection of a solution into the joint space of the knee should have some downsides. Indeed, a 2012 meta-analysis of 89 clinical trials involving over 12,000 subjects published in Annals of Internal Medicine concluded, “In patients with knee osteoarthritis, viscosupplementation is associated with a small and clinically irrelevant benefit and an increased risk for serious adverse events.” Common side effects of short duration following viscosupplementation include swelling, and feelings of pain and warmth at the injection site. Serious but rare complications include infection, allergic reaction and bleeding. The quality of the evidence is limited to the few comments related to the “network meta-analysis.” We are not provided with any details on the methods, number of patients followed, what metrics were used to determine efficacy (other than the acronym) or how long people were followed. We’re not told why this is deemed a higher quality therapy for older people, just that it is. We’ll have to wait until the actual article is published in January 2016 to find out. The statistics provided are fairly consistent to what is given out by the NIH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so we see no disease mongering here. The information is being provided by the American Society for Sports Medicine, a multidisciplinary group of clinicians who specialize in sports medicine. There is a potential for an inherent bias. In case that needs spelling out the potential bias is that the association may be seeking new patients beyond its athlete patient base, and expanding into the aging population of “baby boomers” who have the greatest incidence of knee osteoarthritis. The release states that “people are more likely to show clinical improvement with viscosupplementation over placebo (saline) and intra-articular steroids. This is different than studies recently published that say the average response differs.” Unfortunately, the release doesn’t provide any data supporting that claim. Reviewers agreed that most every credible source of information on the management of osteoarthritis of the knee suggest a step-wise progression of treatments including weight reduction, braces, analgesics, and the like. While the release does mention steroid injections it does so dismissively. Weight loss and strengthening exercises are also mentioned as initial management recommendations, but are quickly glazed over because of “controversial” treatment aspects. What is controversial about current OA treatment? The viscosupplementation procedure may be available at many clinics nationwide. We don’t know so we are rating this Not Satisfactory. To be complete the release could have also noted that insurers place some important restrictions for payment and that  Medicare coverage may vary among states. Suggesting that viscosupplementation, which is not a new treatment, should be a mainstay of treatment based on the argument that some may benefit is certainly a novel (and a controversial) idea. That recommendation puts it at odds with what the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says. Here’s what the AAOS has to say about viscosupplementation, “We cannot recommend using hyaluronic acid (HA) for patients with symptomatic OA of the knee,” with a “Strong” rating, based on supporting evidence from 3 high-quality and 11 moderate-quality research studies that met the inclusion criteria. We think the phrase “high quality evidence” was unjustified language in this release because there was no evidence provided. It’s nearly unheard of for a medical association to offer practice “guidance” or a specific treatment recommendation that changes practice without providing copious data to back up that recommendation.",1
"On 4 March 2017, several dubious news outlets reported that a Japanese man was killed when a six-ton pile of porn he had amassed in his apartment fell and crushed him. While it is true that a Japanese man died in his apartment amidst tons of pornography, the Japanese news website Nikkan Spa!, originally reported that he actually died of a heart attack. Further, despite reports that the man was not found for six months after his death, the Nikkan-Spa! simply reported that the unidentified man’s body was found a month later. Gruesomely, the story notes that the pornography soaked up his “body fluids,” which would normally cause an odor and alert neighbors of his death. “Although it is nightmare talk, this is reality,” the article says. The phenomenon of solitary deaths, or kodokushi, has been a concern in Japan since at least 2005:  According to the Japan Quality of Life Survey, conducted in 2013 by the Japanese government’s Economic and Social Research Institute, 32% of respondents reported that they were somewhat or very concerned about dying alone. According to our own analysis of the data, the worries are negatively correlated with subjective well-being. Worries about solitary death show one of the highest negative correlations with happiness.",1
"In November 2015, debate raged on social media networks regarding the escalating plight of Syrian refugees; during that time, a circulating rumor claimed Anne Frank was denied entry to the United States before her death in the Holocaust. While most Americans were familiar with Anne Frank (and many read her diary in school), the claim labeling her a prospective refugee seemed novel. Its appearance during an ongoing debate about Syrian refugees similarly prompted some skepticism among those who hadn’t before heard it, as Frank’s ordeal and death are a story with which so many are familiar. On 14 February 2007 The New York Times published an article titled “Letters reveal desperate plight of Anne Frank’s family,” reporting that documents newly uncovered by an accident of circumstance revealed the Frank family’s failed attempts at entry to the U.S.:  After lying undisturbed in a New Jersey warehouse for nearly 30 years, documents revealing the desperate efforts of Anne Frank’s family to escape to the United States and Cuba from Nazi-occupied Holland in 1941 have been discovered thanks to a clerical error. “I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to,” Anne’s father, Otto, wrote to his college friend, Nathan Straus Jr., the head of the federal Housing Authority, a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt’s and the son of a Macy’s co-owner, asking him to put up a $5,000 bond. “It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance,” Otto Frank wrote. Page by page, the papers illustrate the tortuous process for gaining entry to the United States in those days. Even with powerful connections and money, European Jews could not overcome the State Department’s restrictions against refugees, said two Holocaust scholars who examined the documents. As the war in Europe intensified, so too did Otto Frank’s efforts to transport his family to safety. He ultimately settled on an attempt to enter through Cuba, a plan which never reached fruition:  By June 1941, no one with close relatives still in Germany was allowed into the United States because of suspicions that the Nazis could use them to blackmail refugees into clandestine cooperation. That development ended the possibility of getting the Frank girls out through a children’s rescue agency. Because of the uncertainty, Otto Frank decided to try for a single visa for himself. It was granted and forwarded to him on Dec. 1. No one knows if it arrived. Ten days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States and Havana canceled the visa. Reuters covered the discovery on 14 February 2007, including commentary from Holocaust scholars who lamented the family’s failed attempt at passage:  If her father had sought help sooner, “Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today, a writer. That is what the YIVO’s documents suggest,” said Richard Breitman, a professor at American University. However, Otto Frank decided to try to escape just as the Nazis were making it more difficult to leave and the United States was making it more difficult to enter, Breitman said. Cuba issued Otto Frank a visa on December 1, 1941, according to the documents, but it was canceled 10 days later when Germany declared war on the United States. A 2007 TIME article provided further details of Otto Frank’s increasingly desperate efforts:  For nine months, they tried to secure visas — first to the U.S. and then to Cuba — until that window shut. Just three letters of the file were written by Otto Frank, all addressed to university friend Nathan Straus Jr., son of a co-owner of Macy’s department store and head of the U.S. Housing Authority. Straus and Frank’s brother-in-law, Julius Hollander, regularly corresponded with two private Jewish agencies, the National Refugee Service in New York and the Boston Committee for Refugees. Straus also contacted the State Department on Frank’s behalf. Hollander and his brother arranged affidavits from their employers, Jacob Hiatt of E.F. Dodge Paper Box Co. and Harry Levine of the New England Novelty Co., both of Leominster, Mass. An April 2015 article titled “Op-Ed: Getting Anne Frank All Wrong” published to Arutz Sheva addressed the plight of Anne Frank and other Jewish refugee children who perished: Otto Frank, Anne’s father, dutifully filled out the small mountain of required application forms and obtained supporting affidavits from the family’s relatives in Massachusetts. But that was not enough for those who zealously guarded America’s gates against refugees. In fact, in 1941, the Roosevelt administration even added a new restriction: no refugee with close relatives in Europe could come to the U.S., on the grounds that the Nazis might hold their relatives hostage in order to force the refugee to undertake espionage for Hitler. That’s right: Anne Frank, Nazi spy. Anne’s mother, Edith, wrote to a friend in 1939: “I believe that all Germany’s Jews are looking around the world, but can find nowhere to go.”  On 4 September 2015, Anne Frank’s step-sister Eva Schloss drew direct parallels between the Syrian refugee crisis and the Jewish refugee crisis of World War II:  “You must not be selfish and you must share whatever you have and help in a desperate situation. They need help from you. “These people have had the courage to do a very difficult thing- to take your family and your whole life to another country requires bravery and strength. This is history repeating itself. “These Syrians are valuable, educated people. These are doctors and nurses who are only too willing to help our society and they will become leaders in the community if you let them.”  The claim that Anne Frank “was a refugee” confused some readers, as they hadn’t heard it prior to the Syrian refugee crisis. But the extent to which Otto Frank tried (and failed) to save his family from death during World War II was only first reported in 2007, and thus didn’t appear in many history lessons before that. Ultimately Frank perished (likely of typhus) at Bergen-Belsen in 1945, shortly after the deaths of her mother and sister Margot.",0
"Follow-up tests show the new vaginas are indistinguishable from the women’s own tissue and have grown in size as the young women, who got the implants as teens, matured. All four of the women are now sexually active and report normal vaginal function. Two of the four, who were born with a working uterus but no vagina, now menstruate normally. It is not yet clear whether these women can bear children, but because they are menstruating, it suggests their ovaries are working, so it may be possible, said Dr Anthony Atala, director of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center’s Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina. The feat, which Atala and colleagues in Mexico describe in the journal the Lancet, is the latest demonstration from the growing field of regenerative medicine, a discipline in which doctors take advantage of the body’s power to regrow and replace cells. In prior studies, Atala’s team has used the approach to make replacement bladders and urine tubes or urethras in young boys. Atala said the pilot study is the first to show that vaginal organs custom-built in the lab using patients’ own cells can be successfully used in humans, offering a new option for women who need reconstructive surgeries. All four of the women in the study were born with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare genetic condition in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent. Conventional treatment generally involves the use of grafts made from intestinal tissue or from skin, but both tissues have drawbacks, says Atala, a pediatric urologic surgeon at Wake Forest. Intestinal tissue produces an excess of mucus, which can cause problems with odor. Conventional skin, meanwhile, can collapse. Atala said women with this condition usually seek treatment as teenagers. “They can’t menstruate, especially when they have a severe defect where they don’t have an opening,” he said. This can cause abdominal pain as menstrual blood collects in the abdomen. “It has nowhere else to go,” he added. Girls in the study were aged 13 and 18 at the time of the surgeries, which were performed between June 2005 and October 2008. The researchers started off by collecting a small amount of cells from genital tissue and grew two types of cells in the lab: muscle cells and epithelial cells, a type of cell that lines body cavities. About four weeks later, the team started applying layers of the cells onto a scaffold made of collagen, a material that can be absorbed by the body. They then shaped the organ to fit each patient’s anatomy, and placed it in an incubator. A week later, the team created a cavity in the body and surgically attached the vaginal implants to existing reproductive organs. Once implanted, nerves and blood vessels formed to feed the new organ, and new cells eventually replaced the scaffolding as it was absorbed by the body. “By the six-month time point, you couldn’t tell the difference between engineered organ and the normal organ,” Atala said. The team continued to monitor the young women, taking tissue biopsies, MRI scans and internal exams, for up to eight years from the initial implants. All of these tests showed the engineered vaginas “were similar in makeup and function to native tissue,” said Atlantida-Raya Rivera, director of the HIMFG Tissue Engineering Laboratory at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City, where the surgeries were performed. Professor Martin Birchall of UCL Ear Institute in London, who wrote a commentary in the same journal, said the findings address some important questions about tissue-engineering, including whether tissue will grow as patients grow and whether an organ as large as the vagina can develop blood vessels when implanted in the body.",0
"In November 2016, the web site TMZWorldNews (formerly CelebtriCity) published an article reporting that the cigarette brand Newport planned to introduce marijuana cigarettes dubbed the “Newport Nirvana”: Reynolds American Inc. Chief Marketing Executive Lawrence Harrison, said in an interview that the company has been ecstatic on the idea of marketing cannabis, and has been monitoring the market for some time. It was only when the recent legalization initiatives — winning in Colorado and Washington — that the company finally made the decision to take part in the cannabis market. Harrison added that they have purchased thousands of acres of land to grow natural hemp. The tobacco company has been setting up a distribution process across North and South American territories, to streamline the supply lines.

"""The story does not discuss the costs of annual mammography screening, or even provide a range of costs. The story does not discuss any health care policy cost repercussions of breast cancer screening recommendations. The story does not discuss the cost of unnecessary biopsies or other treatments for women who have a false positive diagnosis via mammography (greater in women 40-49). The story does note the benefit of screening at age 40-44, 44-49 and for women 50 and older; however, only the relative benefit was given. The story should have reported the number of women in the cohort, who was screened, how long they were followed, and the absolute reduction in breast cancer mortality observed. That has been our standard all along on this site and this is no time to change. The story does a poor job discussing any harms of screening women starting at age 40. We are not told if women 40-44 had more false positive and unncessary biopsies ,or unncessary breast cancer surgery or treatments  for pre-cancerious lesions. We are also not told of the risks of additional radiation exposure on the risk future of breast cancers. We are not given the number needed to harm (NNH) for additional radiation exposure over 10 years of screening. The story tries to summarize the study and to put results in context with other recently published data. But we really expect more of an evaluation of the quality of the evidence than to just quote one of the authors saying he """"could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies"""" and that """"he mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor."""" What? That’s the end of the discussion? These are huge questions. There are many important methodological issues that could/should have been addressed and that WERE addressed by competitors’ stories (see our reviews of the AP, LA Times and NY Times stories.) There are many, many experts who could have been interviewed about research design who could have shed light on these concerns – and some of them were interviewed by competitors. Especially given the back and forth of competing studies (Norway last week, Sweden this week), readers need much more help navigating the evidence. This story just fell short of the mark. The story does provide the NNT (number needed to treat)  to place mortality risk in context here: i.e. screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life. The story cites independent sources, including the Swedish study author and chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s communications committee, as well as other breast cancer researchers who found a benefit in screening younger women and a decline in breast cancer mortality. However, these sources do not  discuss the downsides of treatment. No one is cited to discuss the downsides of mass screening in a group where the risks may outweigh the benefits. Risks of screening low to average risk women in their early 40s include: overtreatment, false positive biopsies, anxiety, and in some cases, a fear and avoidance of future screening when mammography may be of greater benefit. Why not interview a member of the USPSTF to discuss their reaction to this recently published data? The USPSTF guidelines also do note that women at low-average risk discuss screening with their doctor. There is no mandate that women 40-49 not have access to annual screening. Quotes from both Dr. Jennifer Obel of ASCO and from study co-author Hakan Jonsson apparently came from an ASCO teleconference. There was no evidence of any independent research to find independent experts to comment on the study. The story does not discuss the option of NOT screening. It does quote Dr. Jennifer obel saying """"While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best."""" But the story had already framed the new study as counter to the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November – yet this quote is almost the same thing that USPSTF recommended last Fall. ONLY because the story at least cited the USPSTF’s concerns aboutr screening in the 40s, we will give it a barely satisfactory score, because that at least implies there’s an option of foregoing screening. But we easily could have gone the other way with this criterion score as well. The story does not discuss availability of mammography, but such availability is really not in question. So this is judged not applicable because we can’t give it a satisfactory or an unsatisfactory score. The story just didn’t capture what was new and different and noteworthy about the way in which this research was done. Someone who’s not a journalist, Dr. Len Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society, still captured the """"novelty"""" of the research succintly on his blog. He began his explanation, """"There is a bit of a twist in the study which is important to understand."""" Indeed, you can read more about what’s important to understand and why on Dr. Len’s blog, because it wasn’t provided in this story. The answer gets at the heart of the methodology used – and whether it renders the research strong or questionable. The story does not appear to rely on a news release. However, it does appear to rely entirely on what was presented in a teleconference sponsored by the conference host organization. In the end, is that any different that relying on a news release? Was their any independent vetting of claims that took place? There’s no evidence of that. We’ll rule this not applicable.""",1
"On 31 May 2017 President Trump send a late-night tweet that began with a complaint about his press coverage and ended with the non-word “covfefe,” baffling many. While “covfefe” jokes proliferated, some began speculating that Trump had not accidentally flubbed the word “coverage,” but instead had been speaking either in code or Arabic. The #covfefe plot thickens: according to Google Translate, “Cov fe’fe” means سوف فقف “I will stand up” in Arabic. https://t.co/IhIUqQkc4u — Covfefe David Miles (@chrisdavidmiles) June 1, 2017  However, Google Translate brings up nothing at all for  “covfefe” in Arabic. Only by turning it into two words and adding an apostrophe — cov fe’fe — one can create a phrase that Google Translate says means “I will stand up.”   That’s a bit of a stretch — and it’s not even correct, Rasha Sharif, a linguist and language instructor at the DC-based International Center for Language Studies said. Sharif, who is fluent in multiple Arabic dialects, told us by email, “No, the word has nothing to do with the Arabic language.”  In fact, Arabic does not use a “V” sound, which already rules out covfefe or cov fe’fe as a word. Sharif says that she does not trust Google Translate, because anyone can edit the translations. “I found many words translated wrong in the Language tools,” she said. So how do you say “I will stand up” in Arabic? The nearest translation of the phrase is sa aqif or سأقف, Sharif told us. Variations: A separate rumor, this one published by The Marshall Report, held: Covfefe’ (pronounced “cuv – fee- fae”) is an Antediluvian term for “In the end we win.” It was commonly used by the sons of Adam to rail against the evil actions of the fallen who had led man astray. The term gained popularity prior to the great deluge and was rarely used after the flood subsided. It regained favor around the time Nimrod was building his tower, after which it was entirely lost in translation at Babel. The term “antediluvian” does not refer to a language, but a Biblical time period before the Flood. Needless to say, the writer, Dianne Marshall offered no proof for her claim. (The Marshall Report frequently uses “satirical” and fake articles as the bases for its posts.) Another rumor, posted to Facebook by one commenter and printed by the web site Godlike Productions held that word came from a Yiddish folktale about a rare butterfly:  A few people have asked me about President’s Trump’s tweet in which he used the word “covfefe.” Most people think he meant to write “coverage” and they have had quite a bit of fun with it, but actually it is a real word of Yiddish origin, meaning “a futile search” or “a pointless and false quest.” It was originally transliterated from the Hebrew as “kabfefe,” whose etymology is “kab”—relating to the mystical Qabalah—and “fefe,” which is a word for “butterfly.” What Trump was actually saying in Yiddish tweet-speak was, “We are doing great things despite the press’s negative and pointless search, aka fake news.” For those who are interested, the idea of “covfefe” comes from an old Yiddish tale about a foolish Sephardi rabbi who believed he was called to find and destroy the mythical and rare butterfly known as Benshariza, or “Lucifer butterfly”—a name that comes from “Helel ben Shahar,” meaning “shining star” (see Isaiah 14:12; also see Ephesians 2:2, where Satan is called the “prince of the power of the air”). The rabbi claimed that the Benshariza was recognizable by a unique and disturbing pattern on its huge wings, which looked like the moon and star symbol of the god Ba’al-Hadad. He was convinced that this ominous creature housed “the spirit of Satan” and that if he could destroy it, he would free the world of evil. We contacted Ben Kaplan, the Education Administrator at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, who told us by email, after consulting with colleagues:  The Yiddish language and literature scholars at the YIVO Institute confirm that “covfefe” is not a Yiddish word. (However, an anonymous source warns against whispering it three times in the dark, in a mirror, during a full moon.) Isaac L. Bleaman, a PhD candidate and Yiddish scholar at New York University’s Linguistics Department added:  It is obviously a typo for “coverage.” I see no clear (or even unclear) connection to Yiddish. As for the legend cited, if you Google the string “kabfefe” there are only 45 results and all are either typos, or related to the covfefe incident. Nothing found in Google Books. So chances are it was made up. The only Yiddish word “covfefe” brings to mind is kopveytik ‘headache,’ but that would not make sense in the context of the tweet, and it is not an especially common borrowing into Jewish English. So Trump probably has never heard the word, and certainly wouldn’t use it in his English. We know from Trump’s use of “schlonged” in 2015 (a verb that he took from the Jewish English word for ‘penis’ that ultimately derives from the Yiddish noun shlang ‘snake’) that his use of Yiddish borrowings can be rather idiosyncratic. But I don’t think this is one of those Yiddishisms. I’d sooner look for a Russian connection.",1
"""Sen. Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being a """"Democrat-lite"""" candidate who agrees all-too-often with Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton. """"Donald can't criticize her policies,"""" Cruz said May 1, 2016, on NBC’s Meet the Press. """"You know why? Because he supports them. Donald and Hillary, they're flipsides of the same coin. They've both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power. So Donald can't criticize Hillary Clinton on Planned Parenthood, because he agrees with her. They both say it's terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding."""" Cruz has been a vocal supporter of stripping the health organization of its $500 million in government funding since an anti-abortion group released secretly filmed footage purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials selling fetal tissue for a profit. Courts have not found evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. Do Trump and Clinton, respective frontrunners of the Republican and Democratic primaries, agree about maintaining taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood? There’s no question about Clinton’s support for Planned Parenthood. Throughout the campaign, she has frequently attacked Republicans’ pledge to defund the organization. And Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in July, its first-ever presidential primary endorsement. """"I am not only against defunding Planned Parenthood, but I would like to see Planned Parenthood even get more funding,"""" Clinton told Fusion in January. Trump’s position is more nuanced. Regarding abortion generally, Trump has several times raised both Republicans’ and Democrats’ eyebrows by changing position. Today, Trump says he’s anti-abortion. As it pertains to taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, Trump has been fairly consistent since October 2015. He has said Congress should stop providing the group with federal funding full stop as long as they provide abortions. Here’s a sampling of Trump’s comments on the subject: Aug. 4, 2015: Trump said defunding Planned Parenthood would be worth a government shutdown. When radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump if he would support this kind of legislative maneuver, Trump said, """"I would."""" Aug. 11, 2015: Trump backtracked to say he might consider funding for Planned Parenthood services other than abortion. """"I would look at the good aspects of it, and I would also look because I’m sure they do some things properly and good for women,"""" he said. """"The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should absolutely not be funded."""" This is the closest quote we found to support Cruz’s position. We should note a piece of longstanding legislative language called the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or protecting the mother’s health. So technically, federal funding does not support Planned Parenthood’s abortion services. But people who would like to see Planned Parenthood defunded argue that the money is fungible, so any money the organization receives from the federal government frees up other funds to spend on abortions. Oct. 18, 2015: Trump wouldn’t say outright if he would be willing to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood. But he said, """"Planned Parenthood should absolutely be defunded. I mean if you look at what's going on with that, it's terrible."""" Feb. 13, 2016: Trump and Cruz sparred over Planned Parenthood directly at a South Carolina debate. """"Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood,"""" Cruz said. """"And Donald has this weird pattern — when you point to his own record he screams, 'Liar, liar, liar.'"""" """"Where did I support it?"""" asked Trump. """"Where did I support it?"""" """"You said Planned Parenthood does wonderful things,"""" Cruz said. """"It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion,"""" Trump said. """"There are wonderful things having to do with women's health, but not when it comes to abortion."""" Cruz's campaign pointed us to this exchange as an example of Trump being unwilling to say he would cut off all funding. Feb. 18, 2016: Trump said he respects some of the work Planned Parenthood does for women’s health, but their abortion practices should prevent them from getting funding. """"I said defund. I didn't say pay. I said I have a lot of respect for some of the things they do, the cervical cancer on women,"""" he said, but they should not receive tax dollars, """"not while they do abortions."""" Feb. 22, 2016: Trump continued the same narrative. """"Planned Parenthood does a lot of good jobs, a really good job in a lot of different areas. But not on abortion. So I'm not going to fund it if it's doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it."""" March 1, 2016: Even more of the same. """"Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,"""" he said. """"But we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I've said it loud and clear."""" So to recap: Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood seems to be that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, even though he respects some of the other work they do for women’s health. Our ruling Cruz said both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton say Planned Parenthood is """"terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding."""" Trump and Clinton seem to agree that Planned Parenthood does some positive work as it pertains to things like cancer prevention, and Trump has described that work as """"wonderful."""" However, Clinton supports their abortion services, and Trump does not. He thinks Planned Parenthood should not receive taxpayer dollars as long as they provide abortions. Clinton, on the other hand, has said Planned Parenthood should receive even more funding than it does now.""",1
"""During a discussion of American foreign policy and military involvement in the Middle East at the Democratic debate in Iowa, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders turned the discussion to the care provided to American veterans with a startling statistic: 500,000 returned service members have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries. """"When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war,"""" Sanders said. """"The 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury. And I would hope that in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us."""" Sanders has been making this claim for more than a year, including on Twitter in 2014, in a 2014 CNN interview and at a Minnesota campaign event last summer. But is it true? Have 500,000 American veterans really returned home from recent conflicts with PTSD and brain injuries? Sanders’ claim is at the higher end of the range of estimates available. The U.S Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) have PTSD in a given year. As of late 2014, about 2.7 million troops had served in Iraq or Afghanistan. That’s a wide range: 11 percent of 2.7 million is 297,000; 20 percent is 540,000. Additionally, a U.S. Senate resolution identifies """"more than 390,000"""" cases of PTSD among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn in Afghanistan, citing the secretary of Veterans Affairs as its source. Those figures only account for PTSD, not traumatic brain injury, or TBI, which Sanders also referenced. A 2013 Congressional Research Service paper on traumatic brain injury found that almost 57,000 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans were evaluated or treated for """"a condition possibly related to TBI"""" by the VA. That number is slippery though. It’s not clear that all of those nearly 57,000 actually received a TBI diagnosis, and it doesn’t account for the potentially thousands more veterans who experienced a traumatic brain injury but did not receive care through the VA. The VA also estimates that brain injuries account for 22 percent of all combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department, meanwhile, identifies 333,169 instances of traumatic brain injury among service members between 2000 and 2015. That’s a big number, but there are some caveats that come with it: It includes all U.S. forces, not just those deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and is overwhelmingly comprised of concussions and """"mild TBI"""" that by definition lasts less than 24 hours. Also worth noting: that same U.S. Senate resolution noting 390,000 PTSD cases also references """"more than 615,000"""" veterans of recent conflicts who have been diagnosed with """"at least 1 mental health disorder."""" Our ruling Sanders said 500,000 U.S. troops came home from Iraq and Afghanistan """"with PTSD and traumatic brain injury."""" No firm numbers exist for the number of veterans who have returned from America’s most recent conflicts with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries, but Sanders’ claim of 500,000 does fall within the range of estimates provided by the VA and other sources. Sanders’ statement needs that caveat.""",0
"Cost is not addressed, which is unacceptable given that both drugs are already on the market. And the costs here are significant. Ten milliliters of Bavencio can cost more than $1,600. The cost of 180 one-milligram tablets of Inlyta can be more than $15,000. (What were the dosages used in this study? The story doesn’t tell us.) The story makes clear to readers that it has no idea about the extent of the benefits: “While the company said the benefit was statistically significant, they did not specify the duration of progression-free survival.” We’re glad that the story makes its ignorance clear, but it raises the very serious question of why they would cover a story about which so little information is available. Potential harms aren’t addressed. Again, this is unacceptable given that both drugs are already on the market. And these problems can be significant. The potential side effects associated with Bavencio include lung, liver and kidney problems. Potential side effects associated with Inlyta include heart failure and serious or fatal bleeding. The story notes that the ongoing study involves patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, and that the study includes a control group that is receiving a drug called Sutent. It doesn’t tell readers how many patients are enrolled in the study or, well, anything else. No disease mongering here. The story does make clear that the information about the ongoing study came from a company that makes one of the relevant drugs. That’s good. However, the story does not incorporate input from any independent sources. The story states that a control group in the study is receiving treatment with a drug called Sutent, and that patients receiving that drug are not faring as well as patients who receive both Bavencio and Inlyta. However, the story doesn’t address whether any patients were receiving both Bavencio and Sutent, nor does it address any other potential treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma. Are there even other treatment options available? The story doesn’t say. The story does not make clear that Bavencio and Inlyta are already on the market, much less that Bavencio’s current use is for treatment of a skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma. The story provides no context for the research. Are there limited treatment options for advanced renal cell carcinoma? Is the joint use of immunotherapy treatments and anti-cancer drugs a busy area of research? How is this work similar to or different from earlier research? The story addresses none of those questions. The story appears to be drawn entirely from a news release issued by Merck KGaA, the company that makes Bavencio. Of course, it could also have stemmed from a news release issued by Pfizer, the company that makes Inlyta. Given that the story attributes the information solely to Merck makes its release the likely source. Ultimately, it makes little difference: No reporting appears to have gone into the story.",1
"""There was no mention of the costs for drug-coated stents or bare metal stents. The story fails to quantify the benefit of decreased incidence of re-stenosis with the use of coated-stents as opposed to bare-metal stents. The title of the article """"Drug may make Stents Deadly"""" is about the increased risk of fatal blood clots associated with the use of coated-stents and towards the end of the story, the actual magnitude of that risk (ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 % of patients) is presented. However, the story fails to quantify the harms associated with the use of plain metal stents. It does mention that the risks of re-stenosis after implantation of a plain metal stent is higher than with coated stents, though the story does not provide any information about the size of the risk nor the magnitude of the difference when comparing these two treatment options. The story did not clearly present the risks associated with the use of bare-metal stents. It did not outline the difference in risk of re-stenosis and thrombosis for these two medical devices. The story stated that patients with drug-coated stents had 30 – 40% less collateral blood-vessel function than those with bare-metal stents. It is really not possible to interprete this relative change in the absence of the absolute difference nor some idea of how much collateral blood vessel function is needed for optimum protection. The story owed it to readers to dig deeper and explain this. The story did not do a good job of explaining the problem presented in the opening paragraph, i.e. the formation of blood clots were more likely lethal in individuals receiving drug-coated stents. It would have been helpful to more fully describe the development of collateral circulation to provide blood supply to the heart muscle and how less collateral circulation increases the risk to the heart muscle when a portion of the blood supply to the heart muscle is blocked by a clot. Because the story did not explain when the use of a stent is indicated or not, this piece has a disease mongering quality. The story quotes on3 of the authors of the study reported on as well as an investigator in the field who has no obvious connection with the study. While presenting information supporting a hypothesis for why there is an increased risk of blood clots in the coronary arteries of people who have a coated stent as opposed to a bare metal stent, the story did not do an adequate job of presenting the treatment options of individuals with partial blockage of coronary arteries – i.e. the story failed to mention the role of medical therapy either without stenting or when stent placement is followed by medical therapy. Although the story did mention that it was important for """"doctors to make sure they have selected the correct stent for"""" the patient, it would have been more helpful to provide some guidance to readers about how to talk with their doctors to remind them about selecting the stent that is appropriate for that particular patient. The story presented an estimate that 80% of Americans who are treated with a stent receive a drug-coated stent (as opposed to a bare metal stent). The story did, however, neglect to mention what the indications are when a stent (whether bare metal or drug-coated) is recommended. This is a story reporting on the observations from a new study. Does not appear to rely on a press release""",1
"A mysterious international dispute that threatens the recently thawed diplomatic relationship between the United States and Cuba came to light in a 10 August 2017 story first reported by the Associated Press. The report focused on a series of seemingly related illnesses suffered by American and Canadian diplomats serving in Cuba. The original reporting included what later appeared to be speculation from unnamed United States government officials that some form of heretofore unknown sonic weapon was to blame: In the fall of 2016, a series of U.S. diplomats began suffering unexplained losses of hearing, according to officials with knowledge of the investigation into the case. Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of President Barack Obama’s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. Some of the U.S. diplomats’ symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States, officials said. After months of investigation, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been attacked with an advanced sonic weapon that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences. The U.S. State Department later walked back claims that they specifically had concluded a sonic weapon was at play, saying through a spokesperson that “we do not know who or what is causing these incidents”. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described the incidents as “health attacks”, and Cuba denies any involvement. As reported by the Associated Press on 18 September 2017, the range of symptoms is nonspecific and vague: Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, the AP has reported. Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential “sonic attack.” Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. In sum, the symptoms (none of which are universal to all cases) that have been used in the defense of the claim that a “sonic weapon” was used are as follows: Additional clues into the nature of the attack, including the occurrence of an audible noise in some cases, were provided first by a 20 August 2017 CNN report, reporting that some diplomats heard “a deafeningly loud [but unidentified] sound similar to the buzzing created by insects or metal scraping across a floor”. CBS News reported: Some felt vibrations, and heard sounds — loud ringing or a high-pitch chirping similar to crickets or cicadas. Others heard the grinding noise. The reports of screeching noises in some cases and no noise in most cases initially fed both government and media speculation that a “silent” audible device was most likely used (there are ranges of noise close to audible sound that can be heard by some but not others). The two options, then, would be an infrasonic device (below the audible frequency humans hear) or an ultrasonic device (above that range). The debate about which brand of inaudible noise would be used generally boils down to this: infrasonic waves capable of affecting humans covertly would need to be extremely close to the victim or unrealistically large, and they would not be able to produce a targeted attack, instead affecting a larger and thus more indiscriminate area. Ultrasonic waves could be targeted, focused, and beamed from further away, but are unlikely to cause a bulk of the symptoms ascribed to them and unless the device was physically touching the victim. Before diving into this research, two variables related to sound are necessary to understand what follows. These include the frequency of the noise — defined by the number of waves per unit of time — and also its power, determined by the amount of energy each wave carries. The former is reported in Hz or kHz, with infrasound including noise below 20 Hz, and ultrasound encompassing noise above 20 kHz (20,000 Hz). (The latter is reported in decibels or dB.) Below, we detail the main research regarding the primary symptoms discussed in the reporting of the Cuban “health attacks”, finding a.) that the evidence is fairly weak for both ultrasound and infrasound as the cause for a majority of the symptoms listed and b.) that none of the symptoms can be described entirely by either only infrasound or only ultrasound. Hearing Loss  The source most commonly cited in news reports suggesting that infrasound can cause hearing loss is a 2001 review conducted by the NIH, which stated (with heavy qualification) that research, while sparse, shows “physical damage to the ear or some loss of hearing has been found in humans and/or animals at levels above 140 dB”. The 140 dB measurement is no minor omission of detail, as 140 dB infrasonic waves projected covertly at any distance are essentially impossible. The actual studies reviewed in this NIH document generally suggest the opposite: low-frequency, high-power noise will not cause hearing loss, temporary or otherwise, if below the considerably high energy of 150 dB. Ultrasonic sound is widely considered to be irrelevant to hearing loss. Another 2001 review by Jürgen Altmann, an acoustic weapons expert and physicist at Germany’s Technische Universitaet Dortmund and who investigated the bulk of the literature up to that time, concluded that at ultrasound “the ear is essentially untouched” if levels are below 140 dB. Fatigue, Headaches, Ringing Ears, Vertigo, and Nausea  Based on the reviews performed by both the NIH and by Altmann, there is no scientific consensus on fatigue, headaches, ringing ears, or vertigo as they apply to infrasonic noise. The only symptom in this category discussed as a possible result of infrasonic noise is nausea. Per the NIH: There is no agreement about the biological activity of infrasound. Reported effects include […] nausea, vomiting, and bowel spasm. Altmann (and many others) argued that the gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, and bowel spasms in particular, while frequently reported in the press, have been overblown and cannot conclusively be tied to infrasonic sound: The vertigo and nausea effects in the journalistic articles ascribed to intense infrasound cannot be confirmed. On the other hand, low [but still audible] frequencies of 50-100 Hz at 150 to 155 dB caused mild nausea. Many of the above symptoms (headaches, ringing ears, nausea, and fatigue), however, were once referred to in the literature as “ultrasonic sickness”. This suite of symptoms and their ties to ultrasonic noise was based on numerous reports from workers in proximity to a variety of ultrasonic devices or tools. Altmann has argued that this literature is hard to interpret as these environments contain significant audible sound, as well. A 2013 review of the effects of ultrasound on humans makes a similar argument: Many studies confirmed the appearance of subjective symptoms of exposure to noise emitted by ultrasonic devices like dizziness, balance disturbances, tinnitus and fatigue. It is assumed that those symptoms result from the effect of noise on the vestibular system; however, further studies are necessary. […] According to the results of studies in the 1960s and 1970s, “audible” components of the noise spectrum are, above all, responsible for subjective symptoms among workers exposed to noise emitted by ultrasonic devices. Concentration and memory problems There are few human studies addressing the neurological effects of infrasonic sound on cognition. Within those, a few single studies demonstrate a connection between infrasound and cognition on humans and animals. Overall, however, most research demonstrates no connection at all, and none have suggested permanent or persistent issues after exposure, as stated in the National Institutes of Health’s 2001 review: In several experiments to assess cognitive performance during exposure to infrasound […] no reduction in performance was observed in the subjects. Sole exposure to infrasound at 10 to 15 Hz and 130 to 135 dB for 30 minutes also did not produce changes in autonomic nervous functions. In terms of ultrasound, the 2013 review noted that many concentration issues could be associated with the symptoms of “ultrasonic sickness” without being directly caused by the noise itself: It is worth mentioning that some subjective effects of exposure to ultrasonic noise such as fatigue, headache, discomfort or irritation may disturb human cognitive functions. This body of research refers to the transient appearance of these symptoms when in direct contact with that sound, and makes no suggestion of prolonged memory problems like word recall. Outside of occupational studies that lack relevance to sonic weapon development and by their nature include audible sound as well, there is little evidence in humans to suggest that ultrasound can be the cause for permanent neurological damage. Mild Traumatic Brain Injury  Altmann, author of the 2001 review of acoustic weapons, told the Associated Press: I know of no acoustic effect or device that could produce traumatic brain injury or concussion-like symptoms. The only real mechanism for a damage to the internal organ system such as the brain would be through some sort of powerful internal vibration caused by the strong vibration of the sound waves themselves. Scientists agree that this would best be achieved by infrasound, but the evidence that such frequencies could actually make this happen is quite limited and derived almost entirely from studies on animals or anecdotal reports. A 2009 review published in the journal Military Medicine notes that “remarkable properties have been attributed to infrasound, including the capacity to ‘debilitate people for hours and even days,’ with ‘pulsing in their internal organs and blurred vision, both of which can lead to …, in rare cases, death,'” but this review also highlights the reality that there are nearly no studies to back up such claims. In fact, studies performed as far back as 1978 and as recently as 2009 conclude that an infrasonic weapon used to harm major organ systems would be implausible — if not completely impossible. In terms of ultrasound, it is essentially impossible for this kind of energy to penetrate into the human body without direct contact, as the waves dissipate rapidly through the air (and, it should be noted, pretty rapidly within the body as well). Responding to questions that ultrasonic waves could cause brain damage,  Robin Cleveland, a professor of engineering science at the University of Oxford, told the Guardian he doesn’t buy it: “The sound would have to enter the brain tissue itself […]. If there’s even a tiny bit of air between the sound and your body it doesn’t get through.” Blood Disorders Without knowing more than that a victim experienced “a more serious illness that involved a blood disorder” it is hard to confidently assess plausibility of this this kind of disease except to say that the reasons ultrasonic noise do not explain brain damage would likely hold for any illness that requires sound to penetrate into the body. According to the NIH, the most consistently reported effect of infrasonic noise (though the mechanisms remains unclear) seem to be changes in blood pressure and respiratory rate, which could perhaps be linked to other diseases indirectly. There is no existing evidence that links noise of any kind to the development of a blood disorder. In the End, Neither Infrasound or Ultrasound Work as an Explanation Taking even the most tenuous scientific research at face value, an ultrasonic device could be responsible for the transient occurrence of fatigue, headaches, ringing ears, vertigo, and nausea and (even more dubious) concentration and memory issues. Taking a similarly loose approach for infrasound, this kind of noise could cause hearing loss, nausea, and (most dubiously) some form of organ discomfort or damage. Neither can explain all of the symptoms. Further, there is no real way to create a covert version of either device. F. Joseph Pompei, a former MIT researcher and current chief executive officer of a company that develops devices that focus sound into narrow, targeted beams, told us that a focused or controllable beam of 20Hz (infrasonic) sound would require an array of subwoofers “the size of a stadium”. Conversely, he told us, for an ultrasonic device to penetrate into the body at all, the victim would either have to be submerged in water or have the device in physical contact (both conditions would allow those waves to pass into the body without reflecting off it). This, as well, seems unlikely to be a covert choice for an attack. “It sounds very appealing and interesting, but I find it hard to believe that there actually is such a device,”  John Oghalai, Chair of the Caruso Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Southern California, told The Verge. Collectively, the scientific research — which in many cases notes that anecdotal and inaccurate reports in newspapers have long obfuscated the actual science behind the plausibility of such a device — demonstrates that no single brand of sound could create the range of symptoms described by the victims of the Cuban health attacks, and even if they could, a covert device would be hard if not impossible to design. As such we rank the specific claim that an inaudible sonic device adequately explains the health attacks in Cuba as false. On 1 September 2018, the New York Times reported on a theory the government is said to be considering as a cause of the health attacks on American and other diplomats in Cuba: focused beams of microwave energy that can cause both brain damage and the perception of noises when such noises do not exist. This effect, the Times reported, has been known to science since 1961 as the Frey effect or the microwave auditory effect. In a 2017 paper, electrical engineering professor James Lin suggested this phenomenon could explain the events in Havana:  Some readers may find it preposterous or astonishing that auditory perception of (or hearing) microwave pulses is possible. So let me explain. Studies have shown that the auditory phenomenon occurs at a microwave radiation specific-energy-absorption rate threshold of 1.6 W/g for a single 10-μs-wide pulse of microwaves aimed at the subject or subject’s head, for example. Most significantly, high-power microwave pulses may be covertly delivered remotely, so that only the intended target would perceive the sound in his or her own head … Depending on the intensity of the impinging microwave pulses, the level of induced sound pressure could be considerably above the threshold of auditory perception at the cochlea— approaching or exceeding levels of discomfort (including the reported headaches, ringing in the ears, nausea, and problems with balance or vertigo) and even causing potential tissue injury. Douglas H. Smith, the lead author on a March 2018 paper about the Cuban health attacks and the director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania, said that “microwaves were now considered a main suspect.” The Times also cited “a secretive group of elite scientists that helps the federal government assess new threats to national security” assuggesting that the microwave theory is among those being considered. The weaponization of this technology, the Times reported, has been of interest to both the United States and the former Soviet Union. The Cuban government, via a CNN interview with a member of the Cuban task force investigating the attacks, has pushed back against this theory, suggesting it belongs in the realm of science fiction and that it is inconsistent with the reported circumstances described by the victims:  “If you look at the alleged events, there have been reports that there are several people in a room with thick walls and thick windows and only one person was targeted. This is a kind of weapon that doesn’t exist,” said Dr. Mitchell Valdes-Sosa, a well-known neurologist who is part of the Cuban special task force investigating the alleged attacks. “It’s science fiction, not science,” he said. “First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave. What’s next, kryptonite?” the investigator said in an interview with CNN at his research center in Havana, referring to an earlier theory that sonic weapons emitting high-powered ultrasound waves could have caused the injuries.",1
"""At a debate in Tampa, the Republican presidential candidates were asked this stumper by a Florida tea party supporter: How do you convince senior citizens that Social Security and Medicare need to be changed and still get their vote? Bachmann said she had both the government experience and the private-sector experience to understand how the programs should be changed, but she offered few specifics. She also took the opportunity to criticize the new health care law championed by President Barack Obama, saying, """"We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare."""" We've looked into this topic previously, though we haven't heard the specific allegation that the money was """"stolen."""" We'll begin with a review of how the new health care law handles funding for Medicare and for the new parts of the law. To begin with, the health care law leaves in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. It attempts to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid for the very poor and by offering tax breaks to help people with modest incomes buy insurance. Individuals are required to have insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the """"individual mandate."""" And companies that don't offer insurance to employees have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. The national health care reform law also made several changes to Medicare, which makes up roughly 12 percent of the federal budget. In a few cases, the law actually increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source that analyzes the health care system. For instance, the health care law added money to cover prevention services and to fill a gap for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. (That coverage gap is often referred to as the doughnut hole.) Other parts of the law are intended to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage more efficiency and to improve the delivery and quality of care. (An example is paying hospitals less when patients are quickly re-admitted to hospitals after being discharged, to prevent people from being discharged too soon.) The bill doesn't take money out of the current Medicare budget but, rather, it attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in anticipated spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending growth in Medicare, the law doesn't cut current funding for Medicare. Still, where does the $500 billion in future savings come from? Nearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program, an alternative to traditional Medicare that has turned out to be much more costly than expected. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. If you disregard the incendiary word """"stole,"""" it is true that savings from Medicare help pay for other parts of the health care law. That's because Democrats wanted to make sure they did not increase the federal deficit with the new health law. The savings from Medicare offset new spending resulting from the health care bill. Mostly, the new spending in the health care law comes from tax credits to help people of modest incomes buy health insurance and from expanding Medicaid to offer coverage to the poor. The tax credits and other cost-sharing subsidies are estimated to cost $350 billion over 10 years, while the Medicaid expansion costs $434 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those two initiatives add up to more than $500 billion. So in addition to reducing future Medicare spending, the law also increases Medicare taxes on the wealthy and creates new fees for the health care industry, as well as a few other things, to come up with the needed sums. Now, to address the word """"stole."""" The money was not stolen in any literal sense of the word. Congress passed the law through its normal process, and the cost reductions for Medicare were out in the open during the many weeks that the final law was being negotiated. Bachmann said that, """"We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare."""" There is a small amount of truth in her statement in that future savings from Medicare are planned to offset new costs created by the law. But the law attempts to curtail the rapid growth of future Medicare spending, not cut current funding. Additionally, the money was not """"stolen."""" Congress reduced spending on a program through its normal legislative process. That kind of rhetoric is deceptive, and it undermines Bachmann's basic point. We rate her statement .""",1
"""After two black men died at the hands of police, CNN commentator Van Jones tried to make a case for institutional racism in law enforcement with panelist Harry Houck, a former New York Police Department detective, during the July 7 edition of Erin Burnett Outfront. """"The statistics don't lie about the excessive numbers of stops,"""" said Jones, who is black. """"Let's not talk about traffic stops. Let's take something tough like drugs. African-Americans don't use drugs (at a) higher level than whites. (It's) about the same percentage; about 12 percent. But we wind up getting arrested, not 50 percent more. We wind up going to prison six times more because there seems to be some institutional bias. Doesn't that bother you?"""" Houck's response: """"That doesn't show any institutional bias."""" We were interested in Jones' statement that blacks don't use drugs at a higher level than whites, yet they the wind up going to prison six times more often. We fact-checked a similar statement in February 2016, when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared that """"African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."""" We rated that statement True. But Jones' comment was less generic, dealing specifically with drugs. When we contacted him, he said he was going away for a while and couldn't remember the source off the top of his head. So we went looking for information. Jones may have been referring to data contained in the 2014 National Research Council report on """"Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences."""" Pages 60 and 61 focus on drug crimes. We'll talk about drug use first. The report says, """"The prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for others; the difference is not substantial. There is also little evidence, when all drug types are considered, that blacks sell drugs more often than whites."""" We checked the overall data from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Here's the breakdown for all illicit drugs. There are racial differences in the types of drugs being abused, according to surveys by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Blacks, for example, are far less likely to have used marijuana, cocaine and hallucinogens in their lifetime than whites, but — at least in the case of marijuana — whites are more likely to give it up over time. With that backdrop, the National Research Council report says, """"In recent years, drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites."""" Here's the drug arrest rate trend:  But Jones was talking about the rates of imprisonment for drug crimes, not arrest rates. Those numbers turned out to be harder to find. We turned to Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst for The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington. She pointed us to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reporting on the number of people going to state prison for drug offenses and numbers from the United States Sentencing Commission on the racial makeup of drug offenders going to federal prison. Those numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, the state prison data only lists inmates based on their most serious offense, so someone convicted of a drug crime may not be listed in that category if that person was given a longer sentence for assault. Adjusting for the number of blacks and whites (another approximation because many Americans are of mixed race), the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses is about 5.8 times higher than it is for whites. That's very close to what Jones said. It should be noted that these numbers vary from source to source. The NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet asserts that """"five times as many whites are using drugs as African Americans, yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites."""" It doesn't list a source. Spokeswoman Raquel Coombs said the ratios may be out of date. We noted in the BJS data that the racial disparity has decreased significantly since 1991. That NAACP 10 percent imprisonment statistic appears to be based on 2003 data analyzed in 2009 by Human Rights Watch. (We also note that the drug-use statistic is easy to misread. Whites aren't five times more likely to use drugs. Five times more whites are using drugs because there are about 5.5 times more whites in the U.S. population than blacks.) We wondered why so many more blacks are going to prison for drug offenses. They're more likely to get caught selling drugs, as Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, told us back in February. """"Whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest."""" Blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along. As we found in our previous fact-check, their sentences also tend to be longer. Our ruling Jones said that African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but wind up going to prison six times more. African-Americans use drugs at roughly the same levels as white Americans, although overall illicit drug use among blacks has been marginally higher than for whites, with some differences in the types of drugs used, according to a national surveys. Jones' bigger point was about the disparity in sentencing, and the rate of African-Americans' incarceration for drug offenses is very close to what Jones said. We rate his claim .""",0
"The story is clear on this point, stating: “All the bisphosphonates are now available in generic form, for as little as $5 a month.” The only point of confusion is that the story also refers to “newer osteoporosis drugs retailing for hundreds of dollars or more a month.” However, it doesn’t tell us anything else about these drugs, other than their names. (We’ll get back to that in the “Compare Alternatives” section.) This entire story is essentially about comparing the benefits and risks of bisphosphonate use for treating osteoporosis. The story states early on that “An analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine last month estimated that for every 1,000 women with osteoporosis treated up to five years, bisphosphonates prevented 100 fractures and caused at most 1.” But the story also notes that “Some critics say the new analysis overestimates the benefits and underestimate the number of sudden thigh-bone fractures.” There are some issues with the story handles benefits, but we’ll address that under “Quality of Evidence.”  We’d add that as much as we would like there to be simple and incontrovertible answers to questions surrounding benefits and risks, these numbers simply do not exist. The story mentions potential harms in its lead sentence, referring to “such serious side effects as sudden bone fractures.” As noted above, the entire story is essentially about comparing the benefits and risks of bisphosphonate use for treating osteoporosis. The story does a good job of discussing potential (and serious) side effects such as sudden fracture of the femur and osteonecrosis of the jaw. However, the story doesn’t mention the less serious (but more common) side effects such as heartburn or other gastrointestinal problems. Despite its overall high-quality coverage, the story earns a borderline Not Satisfactory on this criterion, and here’s why: The third sentence in the story states, “An analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine last month estimated that for every 1,000 women with osteoporosis treated up to five years, bisphosphonates prevented 100 fractures and caused at most 1.” Several paragraphs later, the story notes that “Some critics say the new analysis overestimates the benefits and underestimate the number of sudden thigh-bone fractures.” But this is is all the information the story gives readers about the NEJM paper. The story does tell us that the paper’s lead author consults for bisphosphonate manufacturers, which makes it particularly important to talk about where those benefits numbers come from. Unfortunately, reading the NEJM paper won’t shed much light on that — because the benefits information cited in the story stems from a table that draws on information from various previous journal articles. Most readers simply won’t have the time, the expertise or the access needed to track down and sort through those journal articles in order to determine how reliable that benefits information might be. If a story is going to highlight bold benefits statements, it should offer some insight into where those numbers came from. Similarly, if a story is going to include criticism about those numbers, it should include some discussion of who is leveling the criticism and what the critics claim the benefits and potential harms of the drugs to be. We liked that, when discussing osteopenia, the story included a quote from an expert that osteopenia “isn’t a disease. It merely tells us that bone density is in the lower part of normal range. There are an awful lot of people who fall into that category who may never get osteoporosis.” Hurray for paragraphs like this one, which help readers understand what a potentially scary medical term actually means and tells them not to panic. The story incorporates input from several sources, and tells readers precisely what sort of financial ties each source has to relevant drug companies. Kudos. The story discusses various dietary and lifestyle choices that can affect osteoporosis risk, which is great — and earns the story a “Satisfactory” rating here. However, there is one area where the story may have left readers a little confused. The story says “other osteoporosis drugs have different trade-offs,” but doesn’t tell readers what that means. It also says, “Newer osteoporosis drugs retailing for hundreds of dollars or more a month include Forteo (teriparatide) and Prolia (denosumab)” — but then doesn’t tell readers anything else about the drugs. If the drugs are worth mentioning, it’s also worth explaining what they are, how they may be beneficial, or at least what some of those unnamed trade-offs might be. It’s clear that bisphosphonates are in widespread use, and the article at least implied that the generic versions were generally available at the low quoted price — giving readers the tools to select the drug and look at reasonable pricing. The story focuses on an active debate, rather than on a new technique, technology, or drug. There are no claims to novelty, so we’ll rate this as not applicable.

""""The Democrats have already voted to BAN our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of DANGEROUS fluorescent light bulbs,"""" writes Alan Gottlieb, chairman of AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates. The letter then invites people to read a letter from the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund. """"By outlawing incandescent lights in favor of compact fluorescent lighting, the environmentalists said the country would reduce energy consumption by $18 billion a year, or save consumers between $80 to $180 on their electric bills per year,"""" the letter states. """"The plus for the globalists? They said it would reduce global warming because one of the causes of global warming is...you guessed it...the old fashioned Tom Edison light bulb."""" The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. """"Help put an end to governmental interference in our lives! Help put an end to Mr. Obama interfering with free enterprise!"""" the letter urges, referring to President Barack Obama. We are checking several claims from these light bulb letters, and in this one, we will tackle the central claim that, """"Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs."""" First off, it's not accurate to pin the law entirely to Democrats. It's true that more Democrats than Republicans voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. But it got a measure of bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 264-163 vote (with 36 Republicans voting in favor). And in the Senate, the vote was 65-27 (with 20 votes in favor from Republicans). And it was signed by Republican President George W. Bush. We also explore the issue of whether fluorescent bulbs release """"dangerous"""" amounts of mercury into the environment in a separate fact-check. But the bigger issue here is the claim that the bill bans incandescent light bulbs. Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards, essentially requiring that light bulbs be 25 percent more efficient than they are now. Specifically, a 100 watt light bulb is to be replaced with a bulb using no more than 72 watts of electricity while still providing comparable light output. The 75-watt, 60-watt and 40-watt bulbs must be replaced by bulbs using no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts respectively. The law phased in the new requirements: first the replacements for the 100-watt bulbs by Jan. 1, 2012; followed by the lower watt bulbs in ensuing years. The curlicue compact fluorescent bulbs and LED light bulbs easily meet the new efficiency standards. But we couldn't find any language in the law that specifically bans incandescent bulbs. So we asked Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund to back up the claim that the law """"outlaws"""" incandescent light bulbs. Arnold said the bill is filled with vague and confusing language and that there is a de facto ban because the standards are so stringent that no manufacturers will be able to build incandescent bulbs that meet them. """"We believe 'ban' is an accurate term because there is no such thing as what they require,"""" Arnold said. """"If it's available, where can I buy it?"""" he asked. """"Why doesn't Home Depot carry them?"""" Actually, they do, said Randy Moorhead, VP of government affairs at Philips Electronics, one of the three major manufacturers of light bulbs in the U.S.  Philips' new EcoVantage bulb, a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100 watt bulb (and lasts just as long), shipped out to Home Depot in April, he said. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs more, but lasts three times longer. Both bulbs are more expensive than the current 100 watt incandescent bulbs, but they more than pay for themselves in savings on electricity to power them (more on that in another fact-check). The two other big players in the industry, Osram Sylvania and GE, have also developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards. But for those, you'll have to head to Lowe's. Moorhead said industry representatives were closely involved in the legislative process to develop the new efficiency standards and would never have supported a ban of incandescent bulbs. The companies, as well as the legislators who drafted the bill, were keenly aware that the new standards could be met through the development of halogen incandescent light bulbs, he said. """"You don't have to buy fluorescent bulbs,"""" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said the claims about a ban on incandescent light bulbs are simply wrong. """"It doesn't ban a specific type of light bulb,"""" she said. This one is a clear call for us. It's true that the current versions of incandescent light bulbs will be phased out of existence. Compact fluorescent and LED bulbs offer more efficient alternatives, but if incandescent light is your thing, the major light bulb makers have you covered. They have developed and shipped halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards, so there is no basis in fact to claim they have been banned in favor of fluorescent bulbs. We rule this claim .""",1
"As the protests against an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation escalated in November 2016, environmentalist activists began targeting financial institutions backing the Dakota Access Pipeline and urging supporters to boycott them with various memes shared around social media, or petitions calling on the banks to pull their funds out of the project:  Financial documents from Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline builder, lists a number of large banking institutions that have provided credit for the project, including: Credit Suisse; Royal Bank of Canada; Suntrust Bank; BNP Paribas; HSBC; Citibank; Morgan Stanley; Wells Fargo, Bank of America; and JP Morgan Chase. The Standing Rock Sioux, who fear the pipeline’s route presents a threat to their sacred sites and water supply, have been fighting the project since 2014, but protesters calling themselves “water protectors,” lead by the tribe, have been camping near the site since April 2016 in an effort to stop the project. As of late November 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the land, and the governor of North Dakota, have made statements indicating they want the thousands of demonstrators encamped near the project site to leave. But the demonstration and continued opposition by the Standing Rock Sioux have turned an oil pipeline project into an intensifying cause that has drawn international scrutiny, an open letter from BankTrack notes: The debacle has escalated into a national crisis and an international scandal. A member of the UN’s Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has been deployed to North Dakota to monitor the situation, while President Obama has intervened to ask the Army Corps of Engineers to examine alternative routes for the pipeline. Meanwhile, the protest at Standing Rock is backed by over a million – and growing – allies worldwide, with numerous solidarity actions springing up across the United States and beyond, including protests at EPFI headquarters and outlets. The world is closely watching how all actors involved will deal with the situation, including the banks that provide financial support to the project. Given the presumed Indigenous rights commitments of EPFIs, it is for us inexplicable that gross violations of Native land titles, threats to water sources and the desecration of burial grounds have not been identified early on as reasons for EPFIs to not provide funding for this project. However, this unfortunately fits into a documented and consistent pattern of disrespect of local communities and Indigenous rights by EPFI-backed projects worldwide. We understand that it is not the role of the EP Association to intervene in specific project situations. Nevertheless, we consider it crucial for the credibility of the Equator Principles as an effective safeguard against violation of Indigenous Peoples’ rights that your meeting calls upon the EPFIs involved in financing DAPL that they take swift action to stop the ongoing violation of the rights of Native Americans. The letter urges the banks to halt further loan payments and raises the concern that the project falls out of line with Equator Principles, a consortium that sets minimum standards to which signing institutions are expected to adhere on matters of community and environmental accountability. According to Energy Transfer Partners, the end project will be a 1,172-mile, 30-inch diameter pipeline: ….that will connect the rapidly expanding Bakken and Three Forks production areas in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois” enabling the domestic production of light sweet crude oil “to reach major refining markets in a more direct, cost-effective, safer and environmentally responsible manner.",0
"Somehow I doubt this is what Coca-Cola meant by ‘the pause that refreshes.’ Here’s a short newspaper summary from 1985 about the first study undertaken to verify claims about Coke’s contraceptive properties:  ‘OLD COKE’ BETTER THAN ‘NEW COKE?’ Common commodities such as honey and sodium bicarbonate, acidic fruit juices and oils have been used through history as spermicides. Three Harvard researchers note that Coca-Cola is said to be favored for this purpose in some developing countries and was touted in American folklore as a contraceptive aid in years gone by. No documentation of the soft drink’s spermicidal capabilities was found, so Dr. Sharee  Umpierre and two colleagues decided to test Coke in some of its various formulations in their lab. They found that Diet Coke was a most effective spermicide and the original formula Coke was also quite effective, five times more so than the reformulated “new” Coke. “Although not recommended for postcoital contraception, partly because sperm can be found in the oviducts within minutes after intercourse, Coca-Cola products do appear to have a spermicidal effect,” the researchers said in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. “Furthermore, our data indicate that at least in the area of spermicidal effect, ‘Classic’ Coke is it.”   [T]he researchers said they found marked differences in the ability of four different Coca-Cola formulations to act as a spermicide. At the same time, they warned against the use of soft drinks of any kind as douches after intercourse to prevent pregnancy. While there are differences among soft drinks, all fail as effective contraceptives, the researchers noted. To test the sperm-killing abilities of various Coca-Cola products, the three researchers prepared test tubes containing small samples of carefully preserved sperm and poured in small amounts of Diet Coke, New Coke, caffeine-free New Coke and Classic Coke — carefully repeating the test three times for each soda. All of them killed some sperm, but New Coke turned out to be least effective, with Diet Coke having the most pronounced effect overall and Classic Coke recording a five times greater sperm-killing rate than its upstart rival. “Coca-Cola products do appear to have a spermicidal effect,” the study deadpanned. “Furthermore, our data indicate that, at least in the area of spermicidal effect, ‘Classic Coke’ is it.” Coca-Cola saw little humor in the Harvard project. A spokesman said the company hadn’t seen the new report, but “our position is we do not promote any of our products for any medical use.”1  However, other researchers were unable to verify these results in later experiments. Subsequent trials performed by medical researchers in Taiwan (using several varities of both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola) led them to the opposite conclusion, that “cola has little if any spermicidal effect”:  The inhibitory effect of Old Coke, caffeine-free New Coke, New Coke, Diet Coke and Pepsi-Cola on human sperm motility was studied with a trans-membrane migration method. None of them could decrease sperm motility to less than 70% of control within one hour. A previous study which claimed a marked variation of spermicidal potencies among different formulations of Coca-Cola could not be confirmed. Even if cola has a spermicidal effect, its potency is relatively weak as compared with other well-known spermicidal agents. Testing of various cola formulas on sperm motility using a trans-membrane procedure did not decrease motility to less than 70% control in a 1-hour period. Diet Coca-Cola had the strongest spermicidal effect followed by Classic Coca-Cola, Caffeine-free Coca-Cola and New Coca-Cola. Since there are no known substances in cola that effect cellular membranes, the results of these tests were not unusual. Other tests have been done using higher dilution of cola which could effect sperm motility and give different results for spermicidal potencies. The results show that cola has little if any spermicidal effect. Its use in postcoital douching is ineffective and could cause complications such as infection.2  Whichever set of results one wants to believe, those tempted to grab a six-pack and head down to the beach should keep in mind that spermicides themselves aren’t all that effective at preventing pregnancy. Saying Diet Coke kills sperm is like saying a rubber glove makes a decent balloon — you shouldn’t interpret either as meaning that using them creatively will keep you safe from parenthesis. (That’s when you wind up pregnant and end up writing a book about it.) Coca-Cola may not be promoting its product as a spermicidal douche, but the idea ain’t new. Coke (and Dr Pepper in the southern States) douches have been part of contraceptive lore at least since the 1950s, with the common belief being that the carbonic acid in Coke killed the sperm and the sugar “exploded” the sperm cells, while the carbonation of the drink forced the jet of liquid into the vagina. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, this method of parenthood prevention proved somewhat popular because not only was it cheap and universally available at a time when reliable birth control methods were hard to come by, but it also came in its own handy “shake and shoot” disposable applicator. After intercourse, the girl would uncap a warm Coke, put her thumb over the mouth of the bottle, shake up the beverage, then insert the neck of the bottle in her vagina and move her thumb out of the way. The warm well-shaken Coke became an effervescent spermicidal douche, with the traditional (at that time) six-ounce bottle providing what was deemed to be just the right amount for one application. As stated above, this method wasn’t all that effective at preventing pregnancy. Though Coca-Cola might have been a (slight) step up from plain water, douching with any liquid is far too often a case of attempting to close the barn door after the horse has got loose. By the time the douche is fired off, 100,000 or thereabouts sperm are swimming around in the uterus, already out of reach of any douche, even a fizzy one. Women should be reluctant to turn to soda pop douches for another reason besides their ineffectiveness at preventing Momhood — the sugars in them being let loose in that part of a woman’s anatomy can lead to yeast infections, an annoying, difficult-to-cure condition. Oddly, a 1992 study conducted by Nigerian researchers found that, although Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola were ineffective as spermicides, Krest bitter lemon drink fared quite well in this regard, and they recommended additional study to determine whether it might have “great potential as such a contraceptive”:  This study investigated the effects of increase in temperature and in pH of Coca-Cola, Afri-Cola, Pepsi-Cola and Krest bitter lemon drinks (“soft drinks”) produced in Nigeria on the in vitro motility of spermatozoa. Of the drinks, Krest bitter lemon (unadjusted) immobilized all spermatozoa within 1 minute of addition. Conclusion: i) alkalinity decreases the spermicidal action of all drinks except Coca-Cola, and ii) Krest bitter lemon may achieve very high efficacy if used as post-coital douche, especially in the impoverished, densely populated Third World. Other than Krest bitter lemon, the significant decreases in sperm motility were not enough to prevent pregnancy. These findings indicated that researchers should test Krest bitter lemon for effectiveness as a postcoital contraceptive. If indeed it proves effective, it has great potential as such a contraceptive among the poor in the densely population developed countries since it is readily available and inexpensive.3",1
"""Ben Carson said it’s """"total propaganda"""" to suggest he had any connection to Mannatech, a maligned nutritional supplement company. At the Oct. 28 Republican presidential debate, hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colo., moderator Carl Quintanilla asked Carson about his involvement with the company. """"This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship,"""" Quintanilla said. """"They offered claims they could cure autism, cancer. They paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet your involvement continues. Why?"""" """"Well, that’s easy to answer: I didn’t have an involvement with them,"""" replied Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon. """"That is total propaganda. And this is what happens in our society -- total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of relationship with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it’s a good product."""" Mannatech sells nutritional supplement pills made from larch tree bark and aloe, ingredients with disputed health benefits. The company in 2009 settled the lawsuit, which stemmed from claims that the company was deceptively pitching cures and treatments for illnesses such as cancer and even Down Syndrome. For Carson to say he """"didn’t have an involvement with"""" Mannatech is a stretch. While he was not any sort of employee for the company as far as we can tell, it’s hard to see the speeches he’s delivered, as well as other promotional work, as anything but a full-throated endorsement of the product. Further, Mannatech appears to view Carson as a product promoter. First, the speeches. Carson has delivered four to Mannatech, according to the Wall Street Journal. Carson has written these paid remarks off as just several of many diverse speeches the Washington Speakers Bureau have booked for him. But in the speeches, he talks about his personal fondness for the product, which he started taking in conjunction with cancer treatment years ago. For example, Carson delivered remarks to Mannatech sales associates in 2004. In the speech, he talked about his introduction to Mannatech’s supplements and a personal conversation he had with the company’s lead doctor. """"I started taking the product, and within about three weeks, my symptoms went away,"""" adding that he toyed with the idea of using only the supplements, rather than undergoing cancer surgery. He said in the remarks that it would be inappropriate for him to be an official spokesman or sales associate, but he does refer people to Mannatech. Since then, he has appeared in Mannatech-produced videos that appear to be promotional materials. In 2011, he answered questions in an interview with Mannatech’s co-CEO and chief science officer. In a 2013 Mannatech video, Carson described his experience with nutritional supplements. """"The wonderful thing about a company like Mannatech is that they recognize that when God made us, he gave us the right fuel. And that fuel was the right kind of healthy food,"""" Carson said in the 2013 video. """"Basically what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural diet as a medicine or as a mechanism for maintaining health."""" Carson also talked about his use of nutritional supplements on PBS in 2014, and Mannatech promoted the interview on its homepage. While it’s no longer accessible, the Mannatech website had a specific tag for all articles about Carson. Carson’s campaign requested that Mannatech remove some videos and articles featuring Carson from its website. And since media outlets have started poking around this question, Mannatech has taken down even more, according to reporters at the Wall Street Journal. Our ruling Carson said, """"I didn’t have an involvement with"""" the nutritional supplement company Mannatech. As far as we can tell, Carson was not a paid employee or official endorser of the product. However, his claim suggests he has no ties to Mannatech whatsoever. In reality, he got paid to deliver speeches to Mannatech and appeared in promotional videos, and he consistently delivered glowing reviews of the nutritional supplements. As a world-renowned surgeon, Carson’s opinion on health issues carries weight, and Mannatech has used Carson’s endorsement to its advantage. We rate Carson’s claim .""",1
"There was no discussion of costs. Why not? You can let a researcher say it’s ready to be used in certain patients, yet you can’t estimate a cost? While reporting that 66 out 67 patients in the study experienced ‘improvement’ in symptoms, it was not clear to readers what exactly was improved, the extent to which it was improved, and what the satisfaction level with the improvement was. There was not an adequate presentation about the benefits from this procedure. The story did not report on any harms observed in the 67 men who took part in the study reported on. The last line of the story indicated that the findings should be considered ‘preliminary’ and an early paragraph indicated that the study had not yet even been presented at the meeting. And, while the story did note that 9 months was insufficient time to measure outcomes, it did not explicity address the limitations of a small case-series (with no comparison group). A story like this must do a better job of helping readers understand why not all studies are equal, why when a researcher says this is “ready to be used” that needs to be backed up by data, and how there is a far greater evidence base for many other approaches to BPH, including other so-called minimally invasive procedures, and including a watch-and-wait approach that many men are happy with – which was never mentioned. The story did not engage in overt disease-mongering. It would have been helpful to know that BPH rarely causes problems that require medical attention, though it can result in symptoms that are bothersome for some men. Clinicians with expertise in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia and without apparent ties to the study reported on were quoted in this story. The story provided some insight about how this new minimally invasive treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia compared with TURP. However it neglected to mention that there are number of surgical techniques and minimally invasive techniques available for which there is comparable effectiveness and fewer complications than TURP. And while the study authors claim the new procedure has value because it didn’t have the higher risk for the need for re-operation, the 9-month follow-up was too short to actually be able to lay claim to this benefit. The oddest part of the story was the line that other minimally invasive treatments “are less effective and have a greater risk of a need for reoperation according to background materials that accompanied the study. (emphasis added)  Does that mean according to marketing materials provided? What was that source of that material? What a silly, unsubstantiated, unsourced thing to include! The story allowed the lead researcher to boast that prostatic artery emoblization was ‘ready to be used in certain patients’. But then it quickly countered that with “but other experts aren’t so sure.” The story could have stated much more emphatically that it is a stretch to think that PAE would be utilized in this new population on the basis of a single, small scale study, presented as an oral presentation at a meeting. Given that the procedure is still experimental at this point, it is unlikely to be widely available. And although the story noted that few physicians are ‘trained to perform the procedure’ it should have been explicit that this is currently not an option for most men. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story a BARELY satisfactory on this criterion. The story seemed to suggest that the procedure reported on was novel; it should have mentioned (as the competing WebMD story did) that it is already in use to treat other non-cancerous, hyperplastic conditions. Does not appear to rely solely on a news release.",1
"This is actually a reasonable question, according to a growing body of scientific research. Daylight saving time is the practice of moving clocks forward by one hour during summer months so that daylight lasts longer into evening. Most of North America and Europe follows the custom, while the majority of countries elsewhere do not. When clocks in almost all of the United States spring forward by an hour at 2 a.m. on Sunday, it will likely prompt an increase in heart attacks and strokes, cause more car accidents and reduce worker productivity, according to studies. It will also fail to cut the nation’s energy bill, contrary to what the experts once believed. In December, a psychology journal published results showing that federal judges handed out sentences that were on average 5 percent longer the day after daylight saving time began than those given out one week before or after. Disruptions, even minor ones, to human beings’ sleep patterns can have outsized effects, according to researchers. “Our study suggests that sudden, even small changes in sleep could have detrimental effects,” Amneet Sandhu of the University of Colorado told Reuters in 2014 after his study of Michigan hospital data showed a 25 percent jump in heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time began. Daylight saving time, which runs until the fall, was widely adopted during World War Two as an energy-saving measure. The rationale was that a later sunset meant people would spend fewer hours using lights inside their homes in the evening. But studies have generally failed to show significant energy savings associated with the shift. Plenty of people expressed frustration on social media on Saturday, as the prospect of losing an hour’s sleep loomed large. “Daylight Savings Time seems like a communist plot to get us all confused and tired and thinking the government wants to help us,” wrote Twitter user Michael Farris Jr. Abolishing daylight saving time – or conversely, extending it year-round – would require a law passed by U.S. Congress. States are allowed to opt out of daylight saving time, but all states are required to follow standard time from November to March. Legislators in some states have tried unsuccessfully to pass laws abandoning daylight saving time, but Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not reset their clocks twice a year. For everyone else, Sunday morning will come just a little bit earlier than usual.",0
"Xolair is sold by both Novartis and Roche, but has lost patent protection in Europe and the United States, leaving it exposed to rivals who are developing copies of the biological drug. None are yet on the market. Novartis said it now plans two Phase III studies for ligelizumab with more than 2,000 patients who suffer from chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), an autoimmune disease that causes persistent itchy reddish welts on the skin. “Despite existing treatment options, too many people continue to struggle with the debilitating and potentially painful symptoms of CSU,” Marcus Maurer, a professor of dermatology and allergy at the Allergie-Centrum-Charite in Berlin, Germany, said in a statement from Novartis. Roche is also developing a new drug, fenebrutinib, to fight CSU and has a Phase II trial, with an expected filing date of after 2021, according to its website. Both companies are looking to develop a more advanced drug than Xolair as India’s Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has a biosimilar copy in the works.

"There was no mention of the cost of the drug but the NYT reported last year that Epidiolex could cost from $2,500 to $5,000 per month. Since the drug isn’t FDA approved, it’s too soon to know whether its cost will be covered by health insurance. The release describes benefits in clear terms, and provides numbers to add context. It states: “Specifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients’ seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen.” It also notes that the difference in the degree of seizure reduction between the CBD group and the placebo group was “both statistically significant and clinically consistent.” The release is clear in mentioning the side effects of the use of this drug in the study: “Side effects – experienced by 93.4 percent of patients in the CBD group and 74.6 percent of those treated with placebo – were generally reported as mild or moderate in severity. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.” The study was a randomized, placebo controlled trial which is considered the highest standard of evidence. While the release didn’t specifically address limitations of this trial, it did recap that this study sought to address some of the limitations present in an earlier open-label study (meaning it wasn’t randomized or compared with a placebo). It states: “The new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient’s families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors.” The release did say that larger, future trials will look at whether the benefits of cannabidiol can be achieved at lower, and perhaps less toxic doses. No evidence of disease mongering here. The release would have been better if it had provided some additional context about Dravet syndrome or on how researchers believe cannabidiol works to reduce seizures. The release mentions that the trial was funded by GW Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Epidiolex. In the trial, patients in the experimental group had Epidiolex “added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period,” so it is obvious that other treatments are available. But these standard medications are not alternatives to cannabidiol. Instead, cannabidiol is an add-on treatment, not an alternative to existing drugs. The release could have named those standard medications and noted that other cannabidiol compounds are being studied in people with epilepsy. The release states that Epidiolex “has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration” yet, so readers can assume that it is not yet available to the public. The FDA does, however, consider cannabidiol an investigational product for treating children with epilepsy and has “expanded access provisions” that allow its use. This would have been useful information to include in the release. The release states that this was “the first large-scale randomized clinical trial for the compound,” adding that the results were both statistically and clinically significant. The release is timed with the publication of the trial results in the New England Journal of Medicine. Much of what is found in the release was reported in the New York Times on March 14, 2016, but that story noted that full study data was not yet available. The release doesn’t rely on unjustifiable language. It inserts needed nuance in several places. For example, it states: “Cannabidiol should not be viewed as a panacea for epilepsy, but for patients with especially severe forms who have not responded to numerous medications, these results provide hope that we may soon have another treatment option,” according to the lead researcher.",0
"The story describes the cost of a similar existing test for breast cancer but is clear to point out that exact costs are not yet available. The story also mentions several times that the high cost of the test may not be worth the expense. The story does provide a range of percentage risk of having a recurrence. The story could have provided the baseline average risk by way of comparison and could have described what the expected benefit in terms of improved survival could potentially be. The story does not describe any harms of the test. Because the test does not predict whether an individual would actually benefit from chemotherapy, some people could decide to undergo chemotherapy based on the results of the test without realizing any benefit. The story didn’t explicitly state that potential harm and we think it should have. The story doesn’t really give any details on the current study or the overall strength of the evidence to support the use of the test. Although the story points out that the results will be presented at a meeting, it should have made the point that these studies are not rigorously peer-reviewed and evaluated prior to presentation, which makes it more difficult to evaluate the study at this time. The story does not exagerrate the seriousness or prevalence of colon cancer. The story is also clear to describe the target of the test – colon cancers that are large but have not spread beyond the colon. The story quotes multiple experts. Clearly not having the test is the alternative. The story did not need to spell that out, but it could have described what is currently done to determine need for chemotherapy, i.e. pathology and/or imaging tests. The story clearly states that the test is not yet available but that it may be in the near future. The story adequately describes the novelty of the test. Because the story quotes multiple experts, it is reasonable to assume that the story does not rely on a press release as the sole source of information. But it does also appear clear that the news release from the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting is driving the story. Otherwise why not wait until the actual presentation of results – or publication of a peer-reviewed paper?",0
"""Most of organized labor -- nearly all -- is just fine with Jim Kenney’s proposed sugary drinks tax. But the Teamsters have a big problem with it. They’re arguing they’ll lose jobs. Opponents to the tax argue higher prices will lead to decreased sales that will eventually trickle down and cause the soda bottling and delivery industry in Philadelphia to collapse. In fact, the loudest voice against the tax (outside lobbyists for the nation’s largest beverage companies) come from the Teamsters. Literally: They organized a ring of 18-wheelers that circled City Hall, horns blaring, to protest the measure. The first-year mayor wants to tax sugary drinks at three cents per ounce -- an unprecedented tax in America -- and use the revenue to fund pre-K, community schools and the city’s ailing pension fund. In a statement, Teamsters Local 830 secretary Daniel Grace wrote that the implementation of a three-cents-per-ounce sugary drinks tax """"would result in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry."""" But there are about 2,000 people working in the beverage industry in Philadelphia in total. So we decided to look a little deeper into this claim. The American Beverage Association has claimed a soda tax in Philadelphia would result in job loss, but didn’t offer an estimate to PolitiFact and referred us to a local firm handling communications for those opposed to the tax. That firm also didn’t have an estimate on job loss and referred us to Grace, the Teamsters head in Philadelphia who didn’t respond to requests for more information. Instead, his spokesman Frank Keel emailed: """"The Kenney administration has no idea about the Teamsters’ various roles in the beverage industry and no right to question the very real job losses we'll suffer if this regressive three-cents-an-ounce sugary drinks tax is passed into law."""" He again reiterated that """"we stand to lose as many as 2,000 regional jobs in the beverage industry."""" Keel didn’t clarify what was meant by """"regional,"""" other than to say """"there are several Teamsters locals in the Philadelphia regional jurisdiction."""" The Kenney administration disputes the figures as a """"doomsday scenario"""" and said any job loss suffered due to the implementation of a soda tax will be offset by jobs created by the programming the tax would fund. """"If sugary drink prices go up, then consumers will choose tax-exempt beverages like bottled water and diet drinks instead,"""" Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said. """"Small businesses will avoid job loss and maintain their profit margins by selling more tax-exempt drinks; and, accordingly, truck drivers will also be fine because they’ll be delivering more bottled water and diet soda."""" Without their clarification, it’s hard to discern how the Teamsters arrived at their job loss estimate. But economists and studies suggest it’s an overshoot. Robert P. Inman, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton school, called the estimate of 2,000 job losses """"off the bounds of realistic."""" About 2,000 jobs would represent nearly the entire soda bottling and delivering industry in Philadelphia, and Inman said it’s inaccurate to assume that a three-cents-per-ounce tax on soda would cause the entire industry to crumble. He said his studies show the city could see a reduction in sales in the $150 million to $200 million range. But Inman said people won’t stop buying bottled drinks. They’ll either switch to bottled beverages like water that’s also bottled and delivered by large beverage companies, or they’ll switch to smaller sized bottles that also still need to be bottled and delivered in the city. """"Wherever they’re getting the number from,"""" he said, """"it is so far above anything that strikes me as plausible."""" The Teamsters say they don’t buy the idea that the sale of water, diet sodas and the like will increase enough to cover the loss suffered as a result of the soda tax. In Grace’s statement, he wrote: """"Consumers simply don't react that way."""" A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found a 20 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (which correlates with about a two-cents-per-ounce tax) would result in small job gains. The study isn’t neutral -- it was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthy Eating Research program. But it found that jobs lost as a result of the tax were offset by jobs created due to consumers switching to untaxed drinks like bottled water. A study published this year by Mexico’s Center for Health Systems Research found that after the country instituted a soda tax, there was a bump: Overall sales increased, largely due to higher amounts of bottled water being purchased. But then, after a year, sales fell to where they were before the tax was passed. The estimate is also higher than any other made before. When city officials floated a soda tax in 2011, the soda companies themselves predicted a job loss of 1,200 people. Al Taubenberger, a current city councilman and the former head of the Greater Northeast Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, said at the time it would cost the city 1,000 jobs. After Baltimore instituted a two-cents tax on beverage containers last year, about 75 people lost their jobs. But Inman said any job loss estimate when it comes to a soda tax is dubious. Without statistical data -- as no other place in America has instituted a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax -- it’s nearly impossible to accurately calculate predicted job loss. """"There’s been no soda tax, so you don’t have any experience who has actually seen what the effects are,"""" he said. """"So you end up trying to guess, and you get into this game of ‘your guess is as good as mine.’"""" Our Rating The Teamsters claim they stand to lose as many as 2,000 jobs in the region and """"countless"""" others if Philadelphia implements a soda tax. This estimate is higher than any estimate floated before and tops what studies show the impact would be. And, at the end of the day, it’s nearly impossible to predict exact job loss as the result of a tax that hasn’t been implemented anywhere else in this way before. Is it within the realm of possibility that 2,000 beverage industry employees would lose their jobs due to the soda tax? Maybe. Is it likely? Not at all.""",1
"""No costs are discussed. But we can understand that since the story is based on an early phase of research – so early that the question might be about its newsworthiness.

"Sometimes touted as the origin of the phrase “son of a gun,” the apocryphal tale of “the bullet through the balls” is a well-traveled legend, often reported by such infamous urban legend vectors as “Dear Abby,” as in this example from her 6 November 1982 column:  It seems that during the Civil War (May 12, 1863, to be exact), a young Virginia farm girl was standing on her front porch while a battle was raging nearby. A stray bullet first passed through the scrotum of a young Union cavalryman, then lodged in the reproductive tract of the young woman, who thus became pregnant by a man she had not been within 100 feet of! And nine months later she gave birth to a healthy baby! The story, in fact, is completely false. The claim for the miraculous “bullet pregnancy” originated with an article that was printed as a joke in the journal The American Medical Weekly on 7 November 1874. Subsequent journals and books cited the article as fact without checking the original source or realizing that it was a put-on, and the story has been passed down through the years as an “actual case that appeared in a real medical journal many years ago.” The long and tortuous history of this legend begins with an article entitled “ATTENTION GYNAECOLOGISTS! — NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A FIELD AND HOSPITAL SURGEON, C.S.A.” appearing under the name of an “L.G. Capers, M.D., Vicksburg, Miss.” in the 7 November 1874 issue of The American Medical Weekly. It recounts the now-familiar story of a Confederate field surgeon who dressed the wound of a soldier injured by a bullet that had entered the soldier’s leg, ricocheted off the bone, and carried away his left testicle. Coincidentally, the same surgeon was then called upon a few moments later to administer aid to a young lady who had received a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Exactly 278 days later, the surgeon returned to the village and delivered a baby boy of the wounded women, although she steadfastly maintained that she was still a virgin. The general tone and style of the article should have indicated to the astute reader that the whole thing was a gag. Even if they didn’t, at least a few more obvious clues gave away the joke: The baby was said to have been born “with something wrong about the genitals,” and upon examination the surgeon discovered that the ball which had wounded the soldier and impregnated the woman was lodged in the newborn infant’s scrotum! Even more implausibly, the soldier, when told of his astonishingly-achieved fatherhood, quickly wed the child’s mother! For those who still didn’t catch on to the article’s facetiousness, a note from the editor explaining that the whole thing was a bit of “fun” (complete with a pun on the putative author’s name) was printed in the same journal two weeks later. (Note: The details of battle given in the original article do correspond to actual events. In May of 1863, Union troops under the command of Major General James B. McPherson set out for Raymond, Mississippi, a town about fifteen miles from Jackson, the state capital. On May 12 a unit led by Major General John A. Logan ran into a Confederate brigade under the command of General John Gregg, and the battle of Raymond ensued, with Gregg eventually withdrawing his outnumbered forces from Raymond and heading down the road to Jackson.) Several months later, the British medical journal The Lancet reprinted (portions of) the 1874 article. Then, in 1896, George M. Gould and Walter L. Pyle cited (and quoted from) The Lancet as a footnote to a section about artificial impregnation in their book Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine. Even Gould and Pyle seem to have recognized the original article’s drollery, however, as they mention that it is included “not because it bears any semblance of possibility, but as a curious example from the realms of imagination in medicine.”  F. Donald Napolitani, M.D., evidently didn’t catch the article’s whimsicality, though, as he presented all the same details as an “authenticated case report” in his 1959 article about “Two Unusual Cases of Gunshot Wounds of the Uterus” for the New York State Journal of Medicine. From then on, one or more of these sources has been cited as proof of an actual occurrence “carefully recorded for the annals of medicine” in everything from American Heritage magazine to “Dear Abby,” with each source accepting the previous ones’ references as accurate citations of a “real” medical journal article. The documents transcribed below include the original 1874 article from The American Medical Weekly that started it all, an editor’s note from a subsequent issue of the same publication explaining the whole thing as a gag, an oft misinterpreted summation from the 1896 book Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, and a 1959 article from the New York State Journal of Medicine by a doctor who didn’t quite get the joke (or do his homework):   by L.G. Capers, M.D., Vicksburg, Miss. How common it is now-a-days, and how natural, too, for men to tell wonderful stories about “the war”; their desperate charges; hair-breadth escapes; numbers who have fallen victims to their feats of personal valor, etc., etc. Then every surgeon has performed any number of wonderful operations before unheard of in the annals of surgery! Until the present moment, I have refrained from bringing before the public, and more particularly the Profession, any of my daring exploits or remarkable surgical procedures; and even now I feel a delicacy in offering the remarkable case, the relation of which is prompted only by a sense of duty to my professional brethren. Doubtless many will pronounce the facts to be presently related as unusual or impossible; to such I need only say, if not, why not? Here are the proofs: On the 12th day of May, 1863, the battle of R. was fought. Gen. G.’s brigade met the advance of Grant’s army, under Gen. L., about one mile from the village of R.  About three hundred yards in rear of my regiment was situated a fine residence, the occupants being a matron, her two daughters, and servants (the host being absent in another army). About 3 o’clock P.M., when the battle was raging most furiously, the above-mentioned lady and her two daughters (aged respectively fifteen and seventeen), filled with interest and enthusiasm, stood bravely in front of their homestead, ready and eager to minister to their wounded countrymen whould they fall in the dreadful fray. Our men were fighting nobly, but pressed by superior numbers, had gradually fallen back to within one hundred and fifty yards of the house. My position being near my regiment, suddenly I beheld a noble, gallant young friend staggering closer, and then fall to the earth. In the same moment a piercing scream from the house reached my ear! I was soon by the side of the young man, and, upon examination, found a compound fracture, with extensive comminution of the left tibia; the ball having ricochetted from these parts, and, in its onward flight, passed through the scrotum, carrying away the left testicle. Scarcely had I finished dressing the wounds of this poor fellow, when the estimable matron came running to me in the greatest distress, begging me to go to one of her daughters, who, she informed me, had been badly wounded a few minutes before. Hastening to the house, I found that the eldest of the young ladies had indeed received a most serious wound. A minnie ball had penetrated the left abdominal parietes, about midway between the umbilicus and anterior spinal process of the ilium, and was lost in the abdominal cavity, leaving a ragged wound behind. Believing there was little or no hope of her recovery, I had only time to prescribe an anodyne, when our army fell back, leaving both field and village in the hands of the enemy. Having remained with my wounded at the village of R., I had the opportunity of visiting the young lady the next day, and, interruptedly, for a period of nearly two months, at the end of which time she had entirely recovered, with no untoward symptoms during treatment; save a severe peritonitis, she seemed as well as ever! About six months after her recovery, the movements of our army brought me again to the village of R., and I was again sent for to see the young lady. She appeared in excellent health and spirits, but her abdomen had become enormously enlarged, so much so as to resemble pregnancy at the seventh or eighth month. Indeed, had I not known the family and the facts of the abdominal wound, I should have so pronounced the case. Under the above circumstances, I failed to give a positive diagnosis, determining to keep the case under surveillance. This I did. Just two hundred and seventy-eight days from the date of the receipt of the wound by the minnie ball, I delivered this same young lady of a fine boy, weighing eight pounds. I was not very much surprised; but imagine the surprise and mortification of the young lady herself, her entire family. This can be better imagined than described. Although I found the hymen intact in my examination before delivery, I gave no credence to the earnest and oft-repeated assertions of the young lady of her innocence and virgin purity. About three weeks from the date of this remarkable birth, I was called to see the child, the grandmother insisting there was “something wrong about the genitals.”  Examination revealed an enlarged, swollen, sensitive scrotum, containing on the right side a hard, roughened substance, evidently foreign. I decided upon operating for its removal at once, and in so doing, extracted from the scrotum a minnie ball, mashed and battered as if it had met in its flight some hard, unyielding substance. To attempt to picture my astonishment would be impossible! What may already seem very plain to my readers, as they glance over this paper, was, to me, at the time, mysterious. It was only after several days and nights of sleepless reflection that a solution flashed before me, and ever since has appeared as clear as the noon-day sun! “What is it?”  The ball I took from the scrotum of the babe was the identical one which, on the 12th of May, shattered the tibia of my young friend, and in its mutilated condition, plunged through his testicle, carrying with it particles of semen and spermatozoa into the abdomen of the young lady, then through her left ovary, and into the uterus, in this manner impregnating her! There can be no other solution of the phenomenon! These convictions I expressed to the family, and, at their solicitations, visited my young soldier friend, laying the case before him in its proper light. At first, most naturally, he appeared skeptical, but concluded to visit the young mother. Whether convinced or not, he soon married her, ere the little boy had attained his fourth month. As a matter of additional interest, I may mention having received a letter during the past year, reporting a happy married state and three children, but neither resembling, to the same marked degree, as the first — our hero — Pater familias! DR. L.G. CAPERS, of Vicksburg, Miss., disclaims responsibility for the truth of that remarkable case of impregnation by a minnie ball, as reported in No. 19 of this Journal. He tells the story as it was told to him. He does not say it is untrue, but is disposed to appositely remember the truth of the old adage, that “accidents may happen in the best regulated families.”  The joke is, that the Doctor reported the case without any signature, but as the editor is indisposed to be made the victim of canards, and recognized the writing sent, he was unwilling to deprive the author of the contemplated fun, and allowed him to enjoy even more of this than was anticipated. The readers have enjoyed the story much, but not enough “to cut capers” after reading it. The following extraordinary incident of accidental impregnation, quoted from the American Medical Weekly1 by the Lancet,2 is given in brief, not because it bears any semblance of possibility, but as a curious example from the realms of imagination in medicine. L. G. Capers of Vicksburg, Miss., relates an incident during the late Civil War, as follows: &nbsp A matron and her two daughters, aged fifteen and seventeen years, filled with the enthusiasm of patriotism, stood ready to minister to the wounds of their countrymen in their fine residence near the scene of the battle of R______, May 12, 1863, between a portion of Grant’s army and some Confederates. During the fray a gallant and noble young friend of the narrator staggered and fell to the earth; at the same time a piercing cry was heard in the house near by. Examination of the wounded soldier showed that a bullet had passed through the scrotum and carried away the left testicle. The same bullet had apparently penetrated the left side of the abdomen of the elder young lady, midway between the umbilicus and the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and had become lost in the abdomen. This daughter suffered an attack of peritonitis, but recovered in two months under the treatment administered. Marvelous to relate, just two hundred and seventy-eight days after the reception of the minnie-ball, she was delivered of a fine boy, weighing 8 pounds, to the surprise of herself and the mortification of her parents and friends. The hymen was intact, and the young mother strenuously insisted on her virginity and innocence. About three weeks after this remarkable birth Dr. Capers was called to see the infant, and the grandmother insisted that there was something wrong with the child’s genitals. Examination showed a rough, swollen and sensitive scrotum, containing some hard substance. He operated, and extracted a smashed and battered minie-ball. The doctor, after some meditation, theorized in this manner: &nbsp He concluded that this was the same ball that had carried away the testicle of his young friend, that had penetrated the ovary of the young lady, and, with some spermatozoa upon it, had impregnated her. With this conviction he approached the young man and told him the circumstances; the soldier appeared skeptical at first, but consented to visit the young mother; a friendship ensued which soon ripened into a happy marriage, and the pair had three children, none resembling, in the same degree as the first, the heroic pater familias. &nbsp &nbsp 1131, Nov. 7, 1874. 2476, 1875, i., 35. The following two case histories show the diversity of treatment for gunshot wounds of the uterus. Although not revolutionary in treatment, these two cases are presented for their unusual results. Both cases have been authenticated. Case Reports CASE 2. — This case of a seventeen-year-old girl was reported by Captain L. G. Capers after the Civil War. It is remarkable in its unusualness and in the treatment of the gunshot wounds of the uterus which resulted. While stationed with a regiment on May 12 during the battle of R, his regiment met the advance of the enemy. One mile from the village of R about 100 yards in the rear of the regiment was a fine mansion where a matron and her two daughters and servants were standing about 3:00 P.M. in the afternoon. The battle was raging furiously, and the woman and her two daughters were filled with extreme interest, standing bravely in front of the house, hoping to give some degree of aid to any of the wounded soldiers. Our men were fighting bravely, but pressed by superior forces, they had gradually fallen back to about 100 yards of the house. Since Captain Capers was stationed with the brigade, he suddenly beheld a gallant young lad stagger and fall to the earth. At the same moment a piercing scream came from the vicinity of the house. The young man was examined and found to have a compound fracture with extensive involvement of the left tibia. The bullet evidently had ricocheted from the left portion of the abdomen and in its upward flight passed through the scrotum, carrying away the left testicle. The matron came running in the greatest distress, begging Captain Capers to go to the assistance of one of her daughters, who had been badly wounded. A few moments later, after examining the young lady, who was sitting on the steps and groaning severely, the seriousness of the wound was apparent. The bullet evidently had perforated the girl’s abdomen in the left abdominal parietes about midway between the umbilicus and the interior spinal process of the ilium. Evidently the bullet was still in the spinal canal, and the wound itself was very ragged and irregular. Dressings were applied and medication given, and since the Army had first call on Captain Capers’ services, he left after prescribing a sedative. The town was soon left in the hands of the enemy, but several days later the rest of the brigade settle in the village of R, and Captain Capers had the opportunity of treating the young lady for the next few months. It was apparent that she seemed to have recovered from the severe peritonitis which resulted from the injury. About six months after her recovery, the movement of our Army again brought Captain Capers to the village of R, and again he was sent for by the young lady’s mother. The young lady herself appeared to be in excellent health, but her abdomen had become enormously enlarged, resembling pregnancy of the seventh or eighth month. Captain Capers stated that if it were not for the fact that he knew the injury and had known the family, he should have diagnosed the case as a definite pregnancy. Therefore, under the circumstances, he failed to give a positive diagnosis, determining to keep the young lady under surveillance. Two hundred and seventy-eight days from the receipt of the wound by the young lady, a fine boy weighing 8 pounds was delivered by Captain Capers, since there were very few doctors available at this time in the vicinity of the town. The mortification and mystification of the young lady and her entire family was apparent! In fact, before the examination Captain Capers stated that he gave no credence to the young girl’s assertion of her innocence and virgin purity! About three weeks after this remarkable birth, the Captain was called to see the baby by the grandmother, who stated that there was something wrong about the infant’s genitals. Examination revealed an enlarged, swollen, sensitive scrotum containing in the right side a hard and roughened substance, evidently foreign. The doctor decided to operate for the removal  of this object at once. In doing so, he extracted from the scrotum a mass which was mashed and battered as if it had met in its flight some hard, unyielding substance. Captain Capers stated that he was astonished and that he finally decided, after several days of seriously considering the matter, just how the incident had occurred. He surmised and stated that no other way was possible — that the mass taken from the scrotum of the baby was the identical one which on the twelfth of May had shattered the tibia of the young soldier and then had plunged through the air into the abdomen of the young lady, carrying particles of semen and spermatozoa through her left ovary and into the uterus, in this manner impregnating her! No other solution to this birth was apparent. Captain Capers explained this to the family, and at their solicitation visited the same young soldier, who at first was most skeptical but then appeared very interested in the young lady. Before four months had passed, he had married the young girl. Several years later Captain Capers received a letter from the young man stating that they were happily married and that they now had three children but the last two not resembling to the same marked degree as the first, the young hero, or the young soldier. This case occurred on May 12, 1863, and was reported November 7, 1874, in the medical annals.1               1381 BRONX RIVER AVENUE, BRONX 59 Reference      1. Med. Ann. 1:62 (Nov. 7) 1874.",1
"On 19 March 2018, the often-inaccurate Daily Mail added a new story to their ever-popular “alarming new drug trend” collection of reportage. In this case, the scary new drug was “bug spray” (referring generally to insecticide products such as Raid, which contain pyrethroid compounds), with the Daily Mail reporting that “US health officials have seen a surge in the number of people using bug spray to get high. In the last year the alarming trend has been reported in Mississippi, Tennessee and most recently Indiana.” Here, the Daily Mail was attempting to tie three separate incidents, speculatively and sometimes inaccurately reported on by local news outlets, into a single, surging trend. The Mail was able to do by capitalizing on the flaws and ambiguities inherent in the original local news reports — a prime example of the local news-Daily Mail misinformation complex. In reality, no evidence establishes such an “alarming trend,” because only one of the three incidents cited by the Daily Mail involved a confirmed case of a person using an insecticide intentionally as a form of recreational drug. The remaining two reports were based on conjecture and hearsay that either referenced the same incident or were too different to be considered part of the same alleged trend (and were also just as speculative). In July 2017, the Monroe County Sheriff’s Department in Mississippi reported that a person had combined methamphetamine with crystals produced from spraying Raid “Hot Shots” on an electrified screen, and then injected that material into his veins. Both local media reports and the Daily Mail used vague language to make it sound as if the situation in Mississippi were part of an increasingly common occurrence, but Chief Deputy Curtis Knight told us that the occurrence was an isolated case: “The incident where an individual was arrested at our facility for allegedly injecting ‘Hot Shot’ bug spray has been an isolated incident. The user and a witness to the use both stated, ‘Hot Shot’ bug spray was sprayed on a screen and electricity applied to crystalize the bug spray then mixed with methamphetamine and injected.” The second “bug-spray” related incident allegedly took place in Tennessee, and it is a memorable tale involving a man allegedly high on a mix of “wasp spray” and methamphetamine breaking into a random family’s home and drinking water from their sink before cutting himself with a knife, jumping out of the house’s second floor window, and throwing feces at police from a nearby tree. While some second-hand news reports suggested the perpetrator admitted to intentionally using this combination of drugs, more detailed reporting held that this suggestion was just an assmuption based on an interpretation of drug trends greatly mirroring the description of the earlier Mississippi event: It’s likely possible because of a dangerous new drug known as ‘Wasp Spray Dope.’ Officials in Lawrence County said drug dealers are crystallizing wasp spray, then mixing them with meth. “It’s fairly new but it seems to be spreading, rapidly,” said Zach Ferguson, an investigator with the Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office. The Lawrence County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to multiple requests for clarification via e-mail, phone, and voicemail, but news reports and a lack of readily available forensic tests for wasp spray imply no confirmation was made that “wasp spray” was found in the perpetrator’s system, or that he knowingly consumed the substance or admitted to intentionally using it, as insinuated by most accounts reporting on this alleged trend. It bears mentioning that a number of drugs, including methamphetamine on its own, can produce similarly bizarre or violent reactions in users. The final and most recent in the list of incidents pointing to this “alarming trend” potentially involved no bug spray at all. The event itself, a series of overdoses at an Indianapolis men’s shelter named Wheeler Mission, occurred in January 2018 and as reported at the time involved no mention of “bug spray”: Over the last two days, 27 people have overdosed on suspected bath salts in or around Wheeler Mission, including 17 who were guests at the downtown men’s shelter. Steve Kerr, Wheeler’s chief development officer, said seven men overdosed inside the building, while another 10 overdosed directly outside the building. All are suspected to have taken bath salts that may have been laced with another drug, he said. According to a follow up report by IndyStar (published a day before the Daily Mail story ran), investigators later concluded that the cause of the overdose was Spice (a name for a synthetic form of cannabis) mixed with some “unknown chemical”: At least 17 guests were believed to have overdosed on “Katie” [or KD] — another mix of spice and an unknown chemical or drug. Most of the men were able to bounce back, but at least one was taken to the hospital and placed on a ventilator that week, according to mission leadership. Indianapolis police said a subsequent investigation led them to several drug houses connected to the distribution of spice mixed with an unknown chemical. Officers made six arrests in connection with the overdoses and confiscated nearly 10 pounds of synthetic marijuana and five handguns. The assertion that the additional chemical was some form of bug spray, and not merely another one of the hundreds of largely unknown chemicals being sold as synthetic marijuana, came from an emergency responder with the Indianapolis Fire Department who was quoted in that same March story: “Indianapolis firefighter Scott Lebherz told IndyStar this variation of KD can take many forms — marijuana, spice, tobacco, even banana leaves — but shares a common trait: all laced with a heavy-duty household bug spray.” We reached out to the Indianapolis Fire Department to ask how they reached the conclusion that the adulterating chemical in these cases was some form of insecticide. An official there told us via e-mail that this was based on stories heard in the field, not from testing: We do not test for Wasp Spray. We have on scene stories told to us — of people spraying their drugs with this and similar products to either enhance the high or confuse drug sniffing dogs. The Indiana Star, the Daily Mail, and numerous other outlets quoted Daniel Rusyniak, the Medical Director of the Indiana Poison Center, to describe the theoretical effects of using pyrethroid as a recreational drug. What is sometimes left out in these reports, however, is his skepticism that pyrethroids would produce the symptoms attributed to them, or that they would be able to cause any enhancement to a high whatsoever. Over the phone, he told us that pyrethroids can cause problems in humans, but only “at concentrations that are probably not going to be achieved unless somebody’s got some good chemistry skills,” adding that “There are a few case reports of people getting [central nervous system] excitation and some seizures and coma, but most people tolerate fairly large amounts of this without a lot of medical complications.” Indeed, the medical literature includes numerous stories of people consuming or even injecting large volumes of pyrethroids and being generally fine without any detour into violent, psychotic, or zombie-like behavior. A 2005 case report, for example, described a 36-year old man who attempted to kill himself by injecting himself with 6 mL of pyrethroid-containing insecticides: A 36-year-old man injected 6 mL of Real Kill Ant and Roach Killer 2 into his antecubital fossa and 2 mL subcutaneously into his abdomen in a suicide attempt. Upon evaluation in the emergency department, 1 hour later, he had pain at the injection site and no other symptoms … He was admitted to inpatient psychiatry and remained clinically well throughout his 3-day course. Speaking specifically of the Indiana incident, Rusyniak — who actually treated some of the people involved in the January 2018 Wheeler Mission overdose incident — told us that the symptoms described were not a unique occurrence, and could be explained by as a result of synthetic cannabis and similar chemicals: “I saw some of the people at the Wheeler Mission, and took care of some of them. [Their symptoms were] indistinguishable from a lot of outbreaks that we’ve seen [that involved only] synthetic cannabinoids.” “The idea that this is somehow unique or different from the clinical effects of the synthetic cannabinoids alone [has not been demonstrated], at least so far,” Rusyniak said. The Indiana incident, is, however, distinct from the previous events alleged to be part of the trend in that the primary drug was synthetic marijuana, not methamphetamine.",1
"""Appalled by controversial videos about the extraction of fetal organs for research, Del. John O’Bannon, R-Henrico, recently asked his constituents whether Virginia should take action against Planned Parenthood. """"Considering the revelation that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit, do you support or oppose a state investigation into the Planned Parenthood chapters in Virginia?"""" he asked in an 11-question survey that was mailed to constituents and remains on his website. Planned Parenthood has acknowledged that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to medical researchers and that the one in California has been getting reimbursed. Scientists have used fetal tissue since the 1930s; such experimentation was instrumental in developing the polio vaccine. Current studies are using the tissue to research maladies including AIDS, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson’s. Federal law bars organizations performing abortions from profiting from the sale of fetal tissue. The law does, however, allow them to receive """"reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue."""" O’Bannon’s statement that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling parts for profit - a claim made by many abortion opponents - is noteworthy because it accuses the organization of illegal acts. So we asked O’Bannon, a neurologist, for proof. He replied in an email: """"Considering the videos revealing the activities of Planned Parenthood officials, I’m surprised you’d ask this question. """"I urge you to watch the videos, obtained by the Center for Medical Progress, in their entirety here,"""" O’Bannon wrote, with a hyperlink to the group’s website. The Center for Medical Progress is an anti-abortion group that made national headlines last summer when it released secretly recorded videos that it claimed showed Planned Parenthood officials trying to sell aborted fetus tissue for profit. The director of the center, David Daleiden, posed as a representative of a fake biotech company that was seeking to buy fetal tissue for research. He approached officials from several abortion-providing organizations, including Planned Parenthood. The footage contains graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and the methods for salvaging issue, which may be done only with the mother’s advance permission. Some of the conversations occurred over meals, and Planned Parenthood later apologized for the casual attitude displayed by one official in her discussion with Daleiden, who was undercover. One video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling Daleiden that he """"probably"""" could obtain tissue for fees ranging from $30 to $100 per specimen. The exact cost, she said, could depend on how much staff time is required to extract the tissue and whether shipping costs were involved. Another video shows Daleiden and an unidentified female colleague - both undercover - meeting with Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s Medical Directors’ Council. Gatter, after much prodding, said the fee for a tissue specimen might be $50 to $75, but she wasn’t sure and would have to consult with others. """"We’re not in it for the money, and we don’t want to be in the position of being accused of selling tissues and stuff like that,"""" Gatter said. """"On the other hand, there are costs involved with this."""" Federal law doesn’t define in dollars and cents the """"reasonable payments"""" abortion clinics may charge for their costs in extracting fetal tissue. Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, has told PolitiFact National that the $30 to $100 range cited by Planned Parenthood officials does """"not appear to be out of the ordinary, but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations (or) institutions supplying fetal tissue."""" The videos have provided new fuel for the efforts of anti-abortion groups to convince Congress and state governments to defund Planned Parenthood. They have prompted separate investigations of the organization in at least 18 states - but not Virginia - and by congressional Republicans. So far, 12 states have concluded their investigations without finding evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood, according to a Jan. 28 article by National Public Radio.. Perhaps the most significant results came from Washington, one of the two states in which a Planned Parenthood clinic supplied fetal tissue to researchers. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, issued a report in November that concluded the organization did not profit from the activity in his state. Officials in California, the other state where tissue transactions are known to have occurred, have not launched an investigation. Planned Parenthood, seeking to quell the controversy from the videos, announced in October that it no longer would accept reimbursement for fetal tissues. It also should be noted that on Jan. 24, a Texas grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing and indicted Daleiden on a felony charge of tampering with a government record by fashioning a fake California driver’s license. Sandra Merritt, another center employee who accompanied Daleiden on some of the meetings with Planned Parenthood, was indicted on the same charge. Daleiden also was indicted on a misdemeanor charge related to trying to purchase fetal tissue. Our ruling O’Bannon said """"some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit."""" As evidence, he points broadly to a series of secretly recorded videos in which anti-abortion advocates - posing undercover as officials of a fake biotech firm seeking to buy fetal tissue for research - met with Planned Parenthood officials. Planned Parenthood acknowledges that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to researchers but says they comply with federal law barring a financial profit from the transactions. O’Bannon’s statement implicitly accuses Planned Parenthood of breaking the law, so there’s a burden on him to prove the organization profited from sales. He falls short by simply pointing to the videos in which Planned Parenthood officials, under prodding from the undercover activists, say tissues probably could be obtained for $30 to $100 per sample. A medical ethicist tells us those fees seem to be a """"reasonable"""" reimbursement for the cost of supplying the tissue. An investigation by Washington’s attorney general cleared Planned Parenthood of charges it was profiting from the sales in that state. Investigations in 11 other states also have cleared the organization. There’s simply nothing that proves O’Bannon’s claim and much that contradicts it.""",1
"""Funding for Planned Parenthood has become a divisive issue in New Hampshire over the past few years. Republicans have repeatedly tried to redirect taxpayer money away from family planning services because the funds go to organizations that also perform abortions. The group at the center of these debates is Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which bills itself as the largest reproductive health care provider in the region. And this year is no different. A recent headline in a liberal blog caught our eye: """"Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’"""" It appeared on the liberal Miscellany Blue website. We’re not checking whether it’s accurate for Groen to say abortions are equivalent to """"cutting children into small pieces,"""" in this fact check. Instead we’ll look at the history of the bill and whether any state legislators uttered those words. The article points to State Rep. Warren Groen, a Rochester Republican, as both the sponsor of a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and the source of the quote. At the time the blog post was written, author William Tucker says, Groen was identified as the sole sponsor on a legislative services request. The full bill has since been written and posted online as HB 677. It’s now co-sponsored with Republican Rep. Richard Gordon of East Kingston. Neither current bill -- titled """"an act prohibiting the use of public funds for abortion services"""" -- nor an earlier version introduced in 2011 target a specific, named group. Instead, they would affect all health care providers that also offer abortion services. The bill suggests that taxpayer dollars going to these groups indirectly subsidize abortions by paying for """"administrative costs, overhead, employee salaries, rent, utilities, and various other expenses,"""" and seeks to ban such funding. Of the affected providers, Planned Parenthood is by far the biggest. For 2014-15, it received $737,586 from state contracts, while the Concord Feminist Health Center received $73,218 and the Joan G. Lovering Health Center in Greenland received $89,214. It’s important to note that the state already bars direct public funding for abortions through Medicaid except in case of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. Groen’s bill specifically targets funding for other health services provided by Planned Parenthood and similar agencies. The blog headline is close to accurate, but it oversimplifies somewhat. The measure targets all abortion providers in the state, not just Planned Parenthood. And what about the """"cutting children into small pieces"""" quote? It comes from a Feb. 9, 2011, Concord Monitor article about a legislative hearing on the earlier version of Groen’s bill. In the article, Groen is quoted as saying: """"I'm amazed the only way we can find to deliver social services is by spending money on an organization whose specialty is cutting children into small pieces."""" Tucker says he highlighted that four-year-old quote because it referenced Planned Parenthood specifically, and because it was made in the context of a formal hearing. Groen’s latest bill hasn’t yet come up in the House. Groen is a longtime abortion opponent, and he’s been outspoken in his views. He has made similar statements recently, too. In the Dec. 20, 2014, Concord Monitor, for example, he’s quoted as saying: """"Imagine how poverty-stricken the state has to be, when in order for women to get health care they have to reach out to an organization that kills babies for a living?"""" Reached by phone, Groen said the quote that ran in the Monitor in 2011 sounded """"pretty accurate to me,"""" and the quote that ran in the paper in 2014 was not exact but """"reasonably accurate."""" He also criticized the news media’s focus on Planned Parenthood in the debate. Groen, referring to Planned Parenthood, said """"they have all the money,"""" suggesting the group was trying to turn his bill into an attack on them. """"Every reporter wants to talk about Planned Parenthood,"""" he said. """"That’s very interesting."""". We’ll note that abortions account for a small fraction of the of the overall health care services provided by Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. According to the group, its New Hampshire clinics were visited 22,283 times in 2013. Medical personnel at the clinics performed 1,573 abortions that year, accounting for about 7 percent of all visits. For reference, the clinics did 2,979 breast exams and 1,859 cervical cancer tests over the same timespan. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England only performs first- and early-second-trimester abortions. None would be considered late-term abortions, a type often highlighted by critics of the procedure, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Frizzell. State-level numbers for the number and type of abortions performed in New Hampshire aren’t available from the federal government, as the state does not report them. The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit spun off from Planned Parenthood, reports that 3,200 abortions were performed in the state in 2011. Our ruling A headline in the liberal blog Miscellany Blue declared, """"Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’ """" Groen’s proposal doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood, but the effect of the bill would be to strip it, and other similar groups, of state funding. Meanwhile, Groen did make the statement about the group """"cutting children into small pieces"""" four years ago, and he’s made similar declarations recently. We aren’t rating the substance of Groen’s accusations, but the headline summarizing what Groen said and what he’s proposing in the bill are generally accurate.""",0

"""Hillary Clinton has a reputation for being cozy with Wall Street -- but in her 2016 campaign, she’s been striking populist tones. Clinton introduced her plan for a variety of economic issues in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 14, 2015. As president, she said, she would go """"beyond Dodd-Frank"""" -- the regulations on financial institutions that took hold in 2010, following the economic crisis of 2007-08. She said she had been calling for financial regulations since the very early stages of the crisis. """"As we all know, in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up,"""" she said. """"I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight."""" Clinton used to be the senator from New York, the home of Wall Street. She has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and of delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of a bank break-up bill, the Glass-Steagall Act -- a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis. So we questioned Hillary Clinton’s record of addressing financial regulations. Did she address derivatives, subprime mortgages and financial oversight so early in the crisis? The 2008 primary campaign While the financial crisis came to a head in summer 2008, problems with housing started to bubble up in 2007 during Clinton’s ill-fated presidential primary campaign. On the trail, Clinton addressed these nascent issues -- particularly the mortgage crisis -- as early as March of that year. Clinton, still a senator at the time, delivered a speech on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market on March 15, 2007. She said too many people were ignoring warning signs. """"The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street,"""" Clinton said. """"It's a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard-working families."""" She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures. In August that year, she delivered a similar speech about dealing with problems from subprime mortgages. There, she reiterated earlier proposals, and also suggested laws establishing national standards and registration for loan brokers, as well as regulations on lenders. """"I think the subprime market was sort of like the canary in the mine,"""" she said. """"You know, it was telling us loudly and clearly, ‘There are problems here.’ """" It didn’t become law, but Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies in September 2007. The first time she mentioned derivatives was in a November 2007 speech in Iowa. (A derivative is a financial product that allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations in an underlying asset.) """"We need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products,"""" she said. """"You can't let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just don't work out. Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families, as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments. Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought."""" In the same speech, she spoke again of the risky lending that led to the subprime mortgage crisis, adding that she called on then-President George W. Bush to convene a conference to find a solution. And she also pushed for more oversight of financial markets: """"So as president, I will move to establish the 21st-century oversight we need in a 21st-century global marketplace. I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent."""" This November speech angered some of Clinton’s Wall Street donors, according to the New York Times. At the tail-end of her campaign, in March 2008 -- still before the financial crisis hit a peak later that summer -- Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation. The plan included, in part, more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened some consumer protections. After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made noticeably fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. But the record shows that establishing policies to address the then-nascent financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008. Our ruling Clinton said she """"called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"""" early on in the financial crisis. The crisis hit a peak in summer 2008, though it started to gain traction in 2007. Clinton began addressing the subprime mortgage issue in her appearances in March 2007. Later that year, she took on derivatives. She also proposed specific plans for solving these problems and increasing oversight of financial institutions. Her statement is accurate.""",0
"Drumming classes do more than conjure dreams of rock glory. They provide effective workouts for all sorts of different drummers, from grandmothers to fitness fanatics. Marc Santa Maria of Crunch, the national chain of fitness centers, admits to living out his own rock fantasy as he instructs a drumming Crunch fitness class called Pound. The sticks, he said, are the means to an end. “You’re using the sticks as a mechanism to keep moving, and there’s constant movement,” said Santa Maria, who is Crunch’s New York regional director. “Your core has to be used for all the basic movements.”  Pound is the brainchild of Kirsten Potenza and Cristina Peerenboom, California-based former drummers who set out to fuse conditioning moves and cardio interval training with the distracting fun of drumming. “You’d never think two drummers will come up with a workout,” said Santa Maria. “They’re also inspired by Pilates.”  The Pound workout is featured on Potenza and Peerenboom’s website www.poundfit.com. There is a network of instructors and classes in the United States and they plan to have an at-home version of Pound available on DVD next year. “After the warmup, around the third track, there are three-minute intervals when you’re doing intensive cardio. Then there’s ab work,” said Santa Maria, referring to the abdominal muscles. People in the 45-minute class spend about 40 percent of the time standing, 40 percent seated, and 10 percent on their backs, he added. Dr. J. Timothy Lightfoot, who has played music semi-professionally for a decade, said it’s about time someone tapped into the fitness potential of drumming. “I’m pleasantly surprised to see this is happening,” said Lightfoot, a base player who is fascinated by the movement of drummers. “It’s always been my observation that drummers are incredibly fit, even though they don’t work at it.”  Lightfoot, who is director of the Sydney and JL Huffines Institute for Sports Medicine and Human Performance at Texas A&M University, said it makes perfect sense to the physiologist to use drumming as conditioning. “It’s very physiologically taxing,” he said. “Runners are primarily using their legs, swimmers are using their upper body most, but drummers are one of the few ‘athletes,’ and I’ll call them that, to have all extremities going at once.”  Lightfoot guesses that a drumming workout class with aerobic and dance elements could burn about 400 calories. Dancer and rhythm aerobics instructor Carrie Ekins originated Drums Alive, a workout which marries aerobic dance and drumming, while recuperating from a hip injury. She found that drumming on boxes helped her mentally as well as aerobically. Drums Alive workouts, which are done in the United States as well as Canada, Europe, Asia, Israel and the Middle East, are popular in senior centers, not just gyms. “The program started when I was sitting in a wheelchair.” said Ekins, who is based in Augsburg, Germany. “Drums Alive aims to reach multiple markets whether one is healthy, ill, young or old.”  Drums Alive has a sitting program for people who can’t train while standing, as well as one specifically designed for kindergartens and schools. She said the choice of music, as well as drumsticks, varies depending on the teacher and the students in the class. Among the benefits of the drumming workout is its accessibility age groups and fitness levels, according to Santa Maria. “There’s a learning curve, but in a few months you can get stronger and more flexible,” he said. “Messing up is not a big deal. Anyone can hold a stick and hit the floor.”  Unlike other classes that require a certain level of fitness or experience, anyone can pound drumsticks. “We many times see performers and we don’t think about their physical exertion,” he said. “Maybe we should think about that.”",0
"""Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu of Los Angeles County repeated a deceptive claim about the GOP health care bill last week after it narrowly passed the U.S. House. Chu said the legislation """"would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition,"""" in a press release on May 4, 2017. Chu and all other Democrats in the House opposed the bill, which has an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate. The national PolitiFact team fact-checked similar claims in the headlines of several blogs and rated them . It called the statements """"bombastic"""" and """"misleading."""" The Washington Post Fact Checker also rejected this claim, giving it four pinnochios. PolitiFact noted that some blogs have changed their headlines or issued corrections. In a written statement on May 10, 2017, Chu said she stands by her claim: """"While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the (American Health Care Act),"""" she said. Summary of PolitiFact’s findings PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at the national PolitiFact’s analysis and summarized it’s findings this way: The GOP bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable. Here’s what’s wrong with the claim Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Republicans’ Affordable Care Act replacement — the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 — weakens those protections. These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can’t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault. But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says. They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically. But the Republican bill doesn’t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that’s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems. Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage. These women weren’t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist. None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify """"sexual assault"""" or """"rape"""" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone’s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions. For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market. If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn’t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance. """"This is not something specific about sexual assault,"""" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. """"But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they’re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future."""" What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Actand how repealing the law would affect women. Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge. The Republicans’ bill doesn’t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition. What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. """"The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,"""" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition. To be clear, the bill doesn’t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual’s """"health status."""" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn’t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare. This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said. """"Could"""" is the key word. What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond. The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco. For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line. Sexual assault """"is the tip of the iceberg,"""" Brindis said. """"There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can’t plan for, can’t avoid."""" Our ruling Various bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition. Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from """"would"""" to """"could."""" The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form. PolitiFact National rated this claim . Following the same analysis, PolitiFact California rates Chu’s claim . – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full: """"As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered ‘essential’. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill ‘would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.’ While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA.

"""Public health experts consider the infant mortality rate an important indicator of a community's well-being. It is one of the factors that helped land Cuyahoga County in the bottom third of Ohio counties in overall health in a national study released last month by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Cuyahoga, with its major health centers, performed well again on access to primary care in the annual study. But major health centers can't compensate for poverty and the other, often related stressors that contribute to the high infant mortality of Northeast Ohio. Ohio's rate of infant mortality -- 7.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in the first year of life -- is 11th-worst in the nation, said a public radio report on the subject on WCPN's """"Sound of Ideas."""" The most recent rate reported for Cuyahoga County was a dismal 9.1 deaths, according to the Ohio Department of Health, and the average from 2006 to 2010 was 9.7. Among the experts who discussed the subject on WCPN was Dr. Michele Walsh, division chief of neonatology at Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital. """"Within the three miles surrounding the University Circle area, infant mortality exceeds some Third World countries,"""" she said, """"and that is an embarrassment and cannot be allowed to continue."""" PolitiFact Ohio agreed that the rate would be alarming. We wanted to know more. We called Dr. Walsh, who said her statement about the city reflects data from a study conducted by researchers at Case Western Reserve University Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences. Its extensive research database is called NEO CANDO, for Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing. It draws from a wide variety of sources that include the U.S. Census and the Ohio Department of Health, and it can break down information by neighborhood. For worldwide rates of infant mortality, we checked the authoritative CIA """"World Factbook."""" The term """"Third World,"""" which once designated countries not aligned politically with the West or the Communist bloc East, generally refers to underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Many poorer nations use the term to describe themselves. For our fact-check, we used the listings of Third World countries, as measured by poverty and low human development, from the Nations Online independent reference portal. To stay within three miles of University Circle, we looked at data for neighborhoods on Cleveland's East Side. We found that two neighborhoods, Hough and Mount Pleasant, had infant mortality rates above 27 per 1,000 -- worse than in North Korea, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Samoa, Maldives or the Gaza Strip. Two other neighborhoods -- Kinsman (with an infant mortality rate of 31 per 1,000) and South Collinwood (29) -- had infant mortality worse than was reported in Zimbabwe. Infant mortality in the University Circle neighborhood, according to the NEO CANDO database, was slightly above 69 deaths per 1,000 live births. That exceeds the rate in countries that include, among others, Bangladesh, Haiti, Burma, Cameroon, Djibouti, Sudan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Rwanda and Uganda. That number struck us as both anomalous and staggering. We looked for an explanation and got one from researcher Richard Stacklin of the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. The rate for University Circle, he said, reflected the neighborhood’s small statistical base in 2009 of 43 births and 3 infant deaths. He said its most recent three-year average -- a preferable statistic for the neighborhood because it better accounts for fluctuations -- is 18.6 deaths, a figure he noted is still unacceptable and almost double the countywide rate. The average rate worldwide, according to the """"World Factbook,"""" is 39.4 per 1,000. The book estimates infant mortality in the United States in 2012 as 6 deaths per 1,000 births -- worse than the average for nations of the European Union and worse than countries including Australia, South Korea and Cuba. Its figures show that some Third World nations have infant mortality rates that are exceeded by those for some neighborhoods within three miles of University Circle.

"Cost is not discussed, but this is an important factor to consider when evaluating any intervention–and especially one that can be expensive. For example, Autism Service Dogs of America (a group that promotes the use of service dogs for patients with autism) estimates that “the full cost to breed, raise and train an ASDA service dog is over $20,000.” Another organization that trains dogs to work with autism patients estimates the cost at $30,000 (though it does not charge the client — the expense is paid through fundraising initiatives). We don’t claim that these are costs that individual patients would necessarily be responsible for, but they do offer some insight into the potential expenses associated with the care, training and upkeep of therapy animals. It’s not negligible, and it’s worth mentioning. This is a tricky one, given that the focus of the story is on the dearth of quantifiable benefits associated with therapy animals. So, what do we look for? Well, in this case, we looked for some meaningful, big-picture discussion of benefits. For example, the story notes that the body of evidence regarding therapy animals “sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.” Is that quantifiable? No. Does it offer meaningful insight into the nature of benefits found in a wide variety of studies on the subject? Yes. Given the thrust of the story, and the in-depth discussion of benefits (or lack thereof), we think this qualifies for a Satisfactory rating. This was a tough call for us: Harms are discussed, but briefly and anecdotally. The brief portion comes in the same quote mentioned above, noting that the body of evidence regarding therapy animals “sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress” (emphasis added). A little more information there would be welcome. There’s also the issue of immunosuppressed patients coming into contact with therapy animals, and possible harm to the animals, who could be over-worked or subjected to aggressive or harmful treatment from even well-meaning people. Still, some harms are at least acknowledged. The story is focused on a field of research, rather than on any specific study. However, the story provides good background on the shortcomings of much of the relevant literature. For example, the story notes: “Most studies had small sample sizes…and an ‘alarming number’ did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal’s human handler.” It also discussed how media headlines often misstate correlation and causation, a problem we’ve discussed many times. Given the nature of the story, and the scope and complexity of the field being discussed, this earns a Satisfactory rating. We also like that the story includes multiple links to additional material regarding the existing body of research. No disease mongering here. This was a strong point of the story. It cites multiple sources, clearly identifies the affiliation of all sources, and places those affiliations in a context that readers can understand. For example, the story includes input from a source at the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI) — and explains that HABRI is a pet-industry backed organization that funds research on the topic of therapy animals. It’s not clear what the direct alternatives would be here, so we’ll rate this as not applicable. However, the story could have talked first-line treatments such as medications and traditional talk therapy. Therapy animals are meant to extend those mainstream treatments, not replace them. The story makes clear that therapy animals are in widespread use, and offers numerous related examples. However, people may wonder how to get one, and whether their insurance would pay. The story talks about prior research and even gives a Freud anecdote about the impact of a pet on psychotherapy, in an attempt to make clear this is not novel. The story does not appear to be based on a news release.",0
"The fruits of this work include the world’s top-selling prescription medicine — the antibody injection Humira sold by AbbVie for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Frances Arnold of the California Institute of Technology, George Smith from the University of Missouri and Gregory Winter of Britain’s MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology were awarded the prize for pioneering science in enzymes and antibodies. Arnold, only the fifth woman to win a chemistry Nobel, was awarded half of the nine million Swedish crown ($1 million) prize while Smith and Winter shared the other half. “Some people breed cats and dogs. I breed molecules,” Arnold told Reuters after learning of the award, which she said had come as a complete surprise. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Arnold had transformed science by using the principles of evolution — genetic change and selection — and to evolve new types of proteins very fast. Arnold is the second woman to win a Nobel prize this year after Canada’s Donna Strickland shared the physics award on Tuesday. Her research on enzymes — proteins that catalyze chemical reactions — laid the bedrock for the development of better industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. “There are enzymes now in detergents that we use in our dishwasher and have been evolved by this process. There are also enzymes that can create new types of biofuels or that catalyze the formation of building blocks for new medicines,” said chairman of the Nobel chemistry committee Claes Gustafsson. “All this you can do with enzymes that Frances Arnold has developed.”  Smith developed a method using a virus that infects bacteria to produce new proteins while Winter used the same phage display technique to engineer the evolution of antibodies, with the aim of producing more effective medicines. Humira, or adalimumab, was the first drug based on Winter’s work to win regulatory approval in 2002. It has since gone on to become a blockbuster, with sales last year of $18 billion. “With this medicine, far fewer people with rheumatoid arthritis are forced to use a wheelchair,” said immunologist Dan Davies of the University of Manchester. Other antibody drugs at the cutting edge of medicine use the same technology, including a number of treatments that have proved highly effective against cancer. Winter said he was surprised by the huge commercial success of antibody drugs, which he put down in large part to the high prices that drug companies have managed to charge for them. “I had no idea they would be so commercially successful ... it was a complete paradigm shift,” he told reporters in a conference call. “Antibodies as a pharmaceutical product are still growing great guns.”  The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created and funded in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901. For the first time in decades, the Nobel line-up did not feature a literature award after a rift within the Swedish Academy over a rape scandal involving the husband of a board member left it unable to select a winner. The science and peace prizes are selected by other bodies. Chemistry is the third of this year’s Nobel Prizes after the winners of the medicine and physics awards were announced earlier this week.

"""Last week, PolitiFact Oregon heard an earful from fluoride opponents upset with our ruling on their claim that Multnomah County has the 15th lowest cavity rate in the country, as the county hovered at roughly the same percentage as the state of New York. We ruled the statement  because county data is not comparable to state data. Plus, we found that New York didn’t really rank 15th lowest because the cavity numbers posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were from varying years and, consequently,  can’t be ranked. Accurate dental health statistics are critical because Portland residents will vote May 21, 2013, on whether to add fluoride to the city’s drinking water. For that fact check, we spoke with Shanie Mason, oral health program manager for the state agency that published the """"Smile Survey"""" in 2002 and in 2007. Her office released a draft of the 2012 version last week at the request of The Oregonian. At the time, she cautioned against such comparisons and said, """"We have only compared ourselves against neighboring states with a similar methodology."""" So imagine our surprise when we read this statement in the 2012 draft report: """"In 2007, Oregon scored worse in every major measure of oral health for children compared to 2002. At that time, Oregon ranked 25th – or 7th from the bottom – in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data."""" It’s accurate to say that Oregon measured worse in 2007 when compared to itself in 2002. However, the """"ranked"""" numbers looked very much like the numbers erroneously relied on by anti-fluoride campaign Clean Water Portland -- which Mason cautioned against comparing -- when it made its claim about New York and Multnomah County. The CDC posts the percentage of third-graders with """"untreated decay."""" But a spokeswoman for the CDC says the statistics are not meant to be """"ranked"""" because they cover different time periods, with some as dated as 1999. The states have different response rates and vary in the percentage of children who qualify for free and reduced-price meals, she said. """"There are many caveats in looking at these data across states,"""" wrote Linda S. Orgain in yet another email to PolitiFact Oregon. """"These issues make ranking the states on these children's indicators less meaningful and probably not accurate. We would not recommend doing that."""" We returned to the Oregon Health Authority for a response. Bruce Gutelius, who is presenting the 2012 survey, said in a reply email they wanted to provide context for Oregon’s numbers. He said they had other options -- for example, sticking with 2002 and 2007 Oregon figures, or measuring Oregon against a national figure from 1999-2004 -- but decided that a ranking """"was the most meaningful to provide the needed context."""" We do not see how declaring Oregon No. 25 based on a list of percentages from other states and other years provides meaningful or accurate context. The percentage of third-graders in Oregon who showed evidence of untreated decay in 2006-07 was 35.4. Vermont was at 16.2 percent in 2002-03 and Arkansas was at 42.1 percent in 2001-02. The Smile Survey released last week contains numbers for children ages 6 to 9 -- so we’re talking largely kids in first, second and third grades. This is slightly different from the numbers reflected on the CDC website. In 2011-12, the percentage of children in this group who showed evidence of untreated tooth decay was 20 percent. In 2007 it was 36 percent. That’s a sizable decrease. This week, the Oregon Health Authority also shared statistics for 43 states, including numbers not yet posted to the CDC website. More than 21 percent of third-graders in Oregon and in Alabama have untreated decay for 2011-13. Oregon is in the middle of the pack if you look just at the percentages for the 43 states -- but again, we don’t know how some of the older numbers have shifted since then. We want the state to make recommendations on public health, even if controversial. The Oregon Health Authority has no official position on the city water measure, although public health officials there clearly favor fluoridating water. But we don’t think this was the most responsible way to put perspective on Oregon’s untreated decay percentages. The agency could have run in its 2007 report all the percentages for the 32 states, clearly citing the years and without designating a ranking. In its 2012 report, writers should have deleted the phrase: """"Oregon ranked 25th – or 7th from the bottom."""" The statement is .""",1
"""The Oregon House recently took up a bill that would change the way in which health care providers get consent to test patients for HIV. Rep. Alissa Keny-Guyer, the House’s newest member, was one of the carriers of the legislation. She gave a moving floor speech, invoking the memory of her father who passed away from complications due to AIDS in the 1980s. """"Much has changed in the past 24 years,"""" she said. """"Treatment has reduced transmission."""" Indeed, she noted, a study last year found that those who were being treated for HIV were 96 percent less likely to pass the infection on to their partners. """"The problem is that too many people still go undiagnosed,"""" Keny-Guyer said. Testing rates remain stagnant. But, she said, these new guidelines could boost the numbers of those getting tested in Oregon. """"Nationally, 21 percent (of those with HIV) are undiagnosed,"""" she told colleagues. """"And in Oregon, only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested."""" We thought the second figure was a little surprising, especially given that the Centers for Disease Control recommends routine screening for all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 and annual screening (at least) for """"high risk"""" individuals. According to the CDC website, high risk patients include """"injection-drug users and their sex partners, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of HIV-infected persons, and MSM (men who have sex with men) or heterosexual persons who themselves or whose sex partners have had more than one sex partner since their most recent HIV test."""" Pregnant women are also encouraged to get screened as part of their routine prenatal tests. The CDC doesn’t keep track of testing rates, but its website does link to Kaiser State Health Facts, a huge database supported by the Kaiser Family Foundation. According to that website, the testing figures for Oregon are slightly lower than what Keny-Guyer reported. Less than 37 percent of Oregonians between the ages of 18 and 64 have been tested for HIV. The national average is 40 percent. If you’re talking in the last year, the figures are even lower -- 18 percent in Oregon, 21.5 percent nationwide. The numbers were off slightly from what Keny-Guyer reported on the House floor, so we talked to an aide in her office to see if there was another source we weren’t considering. The aide told us that the representative used numbers from the previous year (2009 rather than 2010) and forwarded us the latest statistics -- the ones we’d already found. We wanted to do our due diligence, so we called up two additional organizations. Michael Kaplan, the executive director of Cascade AIDS project, said Kaiser’s site was the best he could come up with. """"I couldn’t give you a better statistic than they have there,"""" he said. Karynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, told us the same thing. Anything the state had, she said, would be older and less accurate. With that, we turn to our ruling. While speaking about a bill that seeks to raise the rate of HIV testing in Oregon, Keny-Guyer told colleagues that """"only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested."""" The most recent statewide number is actually a bit lower -- 37 percent. But Keny-Guyer used a correct statistic, it was just a year old. We don't consider that significant enough to downgrade our ruling.""",0
"Serge Haroche of France and American David Wineland, both 68, found ways to manipulate the very smallest particles of matter and light to observe strange behavior that previously could only be imagined in equations and thought experiments. Wineland once described his own work as a “parlour trick” that performed the seemingly magical feat of putting an object in two places at once. Other scientists praised the achievements as bringing to life the wildest dreams of science fiction. “The Nobel laureates have opened the door to a new era of experimentation with quantum physics by demonstrating the direct observation of individual quantum particles without destroying them,” said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded them the 8 million crown ($1.2 million) prize. “Perhaps the quantum computer will change our everyday lives in this century in the same radical way as the classical computer did in the last century.”  Haroche said he was walking in the street with his wife when he recognized the Swedish country code on the incoming call to inform him of the award. “I saw the area code 46, then I sat down,” he told reporters in Sweden by telephone. “First I called my children, then I called my closest colleagues, without whom I would never have won this prize,” he said. Asked how he would celebrate, he said: “I will have champagne, of course.”  He told Reuters he hoped the prize would give him a platform “that will allow me to communicate ideas, not just in this field of research but for research in general, fundamental research”. Wineland was asleep at home in Boulder, Colorado, when the phone call from Stockholm arrived before dawn on Tuesday morning, he said at a press conference. (His wife answered.) Physics is the second of this year’s crop of awards; scientists from Britain and Japan shared the first prize on Monday, in medicine, for adult stem cell research. The prizes, which reward achievements in science, literature and peace, were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of Swedish dynamite millionaire Alfred Nobel. “This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes some of the most incredible experimental tests of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics,” said Jim Al-Khalili, professor of physics at the University of Surrey in Britain. “Until the last decade or two, some of these results were nothing more than ideas in science fiction or, at best, the wilder imaginations of quantum physicists. Wineland and Haroche and their teams have shown just how strange the quantum world really is and opened up the potential for new technologies undreamt of not so long ago.”  Quantum physics studies the behavior of the fundamental building blocks of the universe at a scale smaller than atoms, when tiny particles act in strange ways that can only be described with advanced mathematics. Researchers have long dreamt of building “quantum computers” that would operate using that mathematics - able to conduct far more complicated calculations and hold vastly more data than classical computers. But they could only be built if the behavior of individual particles could be observed. “Single particles are not easily isolated from their surrounding environment, and they lose their mysterious quantum properties as soon as they interact with the outside world,” the Nobel committee explained. “Through their ingenious laboratory methods Haroche and Wineland, together with their research groups, have managed to measure and control very fragile quantum states, which were previously thought inaccessible for direct observation. The new methods allow them to examine, control and count the particles.”  Both scientists work in the field of quantum optics, studying the fundamental interactions between light and matter. The Nobel committee said they used opposite approaches to the same problem: Wineland uses light particles - or photons - to measure and control particles of matter - electrons - while Haroche uses electrons to control and measure photons. In one of the strange properties of quantum mechanics, tiny particles act as if they are simultaneously in two locations, based on the likelihood that they would be found at either, known as a “superposition.”  It was long thought that it would be impossible to demonstrate this in a lab. But Wineland’s “parlour trick” was to hit an atom with laser light, which according to quantum theory had a 50 percent chance of moving it, and observe the atom at two different locations, 80 billionths of a meter apart. In a normal computer, a switch must either be on or off. A quantum computer would work with switches that, like the particles in Wineland’s experiment, behaved as if they were in more than one position at the same time. An example is a computer trying to work out the shortest route around town for a travelling salesman. A traditional computer might try every possible route and then choose the shortest. A quantum computer could do the calculation in one step, as if the salesman travelled each route simultaneously. Wineland is a dedicated experimentalist, not bothered by the bizarre philosophical implications of quantum mechanics, such as the notion that reality does not exist until an observer measures it. “You can find debate on this, but I’m not sure we’re so special in the universe” as to have the power to bring reality into being, he told Reuters. His realism extends to applications of his work. “I wouldn’t recommend anybody buy stock in a quantum computing company,” Wineland told reporters, but he said he was optimistic that it might be possible to build one eventually. He plans to be part of the quest. Asked if his science career was nearing an end, he said he had no plans to retire “until they drag me out of here for being too old”.

"""Three of the biggest hot buttons in politics these days are health care, privacy and guns. Put all three of them together and you get an explosive claim. A reader recently asked us to look into a blog post at the website Mr. Conservative, with the provocative headline, """"Obama Quietly Uses Executive Orders For Two New Gun Control Laws."""" """"Just a few weeks ago,"""" the post said, President Barack Obama """"quietly used executive action — one of his new favorite pastimes — that has got gun owners’ feathers in a ruffle. According to Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government. The illegally obtained data is then used as justification for gun confiscation by the federal government."""" Mr. Conservative’s claims don’t have to do with Obama’s health care law. Obamacare explicitly bars the collection of information about """"the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition"""" or the maintenance of """"records of individual ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition."""" Rather, at issue is a proposed rule that would clarify some currently murky interpretations of privacy restrictions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which set limits on who can share and receive private health information about individuals. The provision cited in the blog post is designed to make clear that state authorities are allowed to share certain information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is used to screen potential gun purchasers. Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law-enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Another one -- the one that’s important for this discussion because it intersects with the health care system -- is involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The instant background check system is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. Several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, privacy is a key reason cited by states that haven’t provided data about involuntary commitments. The federal government’s argument is that these states are being needlessly cautious. The government says the kind of data being sought for background checks isn’t subject to HIPAA’s privacy restrictions. The HHS proposal would explicitly clarify that point. Let’s take a look at the claim phrase by phrase. • It’s an """"unconstitutionally enacted law."""" Like the old-timey drink known as an egg cream -- which includes neither egg nor cream -- this provision isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted yet and it’s not unconstitutional. A law is a bill passed by Congress and signed by the president; that doesn’t describe this provision. Nor is it an """"executive order,"""" the term used in the headline. Executive orders are directives written and personally signed by the president. Instead, it’s an administrative regulation. Specifically, it’s a notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. In other words, it’s a policy proposal emerging from a federal agency, with a specified public comment period before the agency decides whether to enact it -- or scrap it. So while it’s fair to say the Obama administration is behind it, it would be incorrect to say it’s already """"enacted."""" It’s currently in the comment phase, and it may not ever be enacted. As for """"unconstitutional,"""" the Supreme Court, for one, doesn’t consider the regulatory process to be problematic constitutionally. """"Some people do question the constitutionality of the administrative state, but as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, it's been settled law for almost 100 years that Congress can delegate rulemaking authority to federal agencies,"""" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. • """"Health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws to submit medical data to the government"""" The information reportable to NICS doesn’t concern physicians’ medical records about diagnoses of mental illness, prescriptions, or treatment recommendations. Rather, the relevant information for gun-buying purposes -- and thus for providing data to NICS -- are decisions by """"a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority."""" As HHS put it when it released the proposed rule, """"Seeking help for mental health problems or getting treatment does not make someone legally prohibited from having a firearm, and nothing in this proposed rule changes that. Furthermore, nothing in this proposed rule would require reporting on general mental health visits or other routine mental health care, or exempt providers solely performing these treatment services from existing privacy rules."""" Importantly, HHS added that """"the proposed modifications would merely permit, and not require, covered entities to report to the NICS."""" That directly conflicts with the blog post’s claim. So, let’s recap: """"Health care professionals"""" is misleading -- it’s courts, boards and commissions, not doctors, who would be submitting to NICS. """"Are now"""" is wrong because, as we noted, this is a proposal and is not in force yet. """"Required"""" is wrong because state entities would be able to submit to NICS, but would not be required to do so. """"To violate HIPAA privacy laws"""" is at best misleading because HIPAA already didn’t block the transfer of this kind of data; the proposed rule simply makes that point extra clear. And """"to submit medical data to the government"""" is misleading because only involuntary commitment data is sought by NICS, not detailed treatment records. • It’s """"justification for gun confiscation"""" The idea that Obama wants to take away Americans’ guns is a durable one among his critics. But it’s unclear the extent to which the HHS proposal would make this scenario more likely. On the surface, all NICS does is prevent ineligible people from newly purchasing a gun. It says nothing about taking away the guns they already own. But if someone is unable to purchase a gun, it also means they’re unable to own a gun. The question is how aggressively this is enforced. Critics of the proposal say that increasing the flow of mental-health information to NICS could promote rise in confiscation. If enacted, the proposal """"would make it clear that the ATF and other federal agencies could troll this database for persons with Alzheimer's, PTSD, ADHD, etc.,"""" said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, a group that has been critical of the HHS proposal. In the group’s official comments to HHS on the proposal, it cited a letter from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that says that 140,000 veterans have been added to the NICS list over the years. Coburn and Gun Owners of America say too many of these veterans are being caught up in the dragnet. In addition, California in 2013 passed a law that allocated $24 million to enforce the confiscation of firearms from people who are not allowed to own them, using a variety of databases; about 30 percent of these people were mentally ill. While NICS only accepts into its database the official determinations of mental incompetency, Hammond warned that there’s no universal standard for incompetency determinations. They may be """"made with little more than a psychiatric diagnosis and perhaps a star-chamber proceeding, in which a supposedly incompetent person is deemed competent to have waived all of his or her rights,"""" Hammond said. """"This would mean that the names of persons who had received little due process"""" might find their information newly added to NICS, leaving them open to confiscation. But even if these are legitimate concerns, others don’t see the HIPAA proposal as a harbinger of massive gun confiscations. Mark Heyrman, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, called any kind of large-scale gun confiscation effort based on the HHS action """"implausible."""" Jay Corzine, a sociologist who studies gun policy at the University of Central Florida, agreed, saying the proposal strikes a """"reasonable"""" balance. Federal law """"proscribes possession of a firearm by persons in these groups and could conceivably lead to seizure of firearms owned prior to their change in status,"""" he said. """"This currently occurs in selected situations -- domestic violence cases in some states for example. Not very many people would be impacted, however, and the idea that this is the opening move in a planned campaign for large-scale gun confiscation is far-fetched at best."""" Our ruling The post we’re checking said that, """"according to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government,"""" which is """"then used as justification for gun confiscation."""" The elements of this claim range from misleading to flat-out wrong. The one area of reasonable concern is that some jurisdictions may lack full due process for declaring someone mentally incompetent, potentially putting some people at risk of seeing their guns confiscated. But this depends on how proactively the authorities enforce gun laws. Experts say widespread gun confiscation is implausible. The rule isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted and it isn’t unconstitutional according to Supreme Court jurisprudence. It isn’t a requirement, and it doesn’t involve routine diagnostic data compiled by """"health care professionals"""" such as doctors.""",1
"""Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman pulls no punches in an ad accusing his Democratic opponent,  Morgan Carroll, of using her role as a state senator to benefit her """"shady interests"""" as a trial lawyer. """"Meet Morgan Carroll, state senator, who’s also Morgan Carroll, personal injury lawyer,"""" the narrator says in the ad that aired Sept. 20. """"Morgan Carroll the lawyer has worked for some of the sleaziest firms in the state. And they love frivolous lawsuits."""" The ad shows photos of Carroll on billboards next to slimy-looking lawyers. The narrator says the state senator’s votes resulted in """"making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."""" Coffman’s radio version of the ad goes further, accusing Carroll of """"using her position in the state Senate to line her own pockets"""" and speaking about an """"odor of corruption,"""" the Denver Post reported. We took a hard look at Coffman’s TV ad claim that Carroll's votes resulted in """"making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses""""to serve her """"shady interests."""" Carroll became an attorney in 2000, and spent the first decade of her career working with her mother. Their firm mostly represented clients with disabilities, Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich told PolitiFact. In an ad of her own, Carroll recalls that she was a girl when her dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and she watched him get sicker as medical costs wiped out his retirement savings. """"It's why I've dedicated my career to fighting for people with disabilities, helping people stay in their homes and receive the care they need,"""" she says. More recently, Carroll worked for two big personal injury law firms whose TV commercials are well-known to Coloradans. She spent two years at the Sawaya Law Firm, then moved to Bachus & Schanker. The Bachus & Schanker website says, """"Morgan Carroll specializes in representing people in personal injury, Workers' Compensation, Social Security Disability and employment law."""" Godinich said Carroll primarily was doing legal research at the firm until about four months ago when she took time off to devote herself to the race against Coffman for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, a crescent-ring of Denver suburbs. The Coffman ad focuses on two bills Carroll worked on. One of them is the Good Samaritans in Health Care Act of 2006, which Coffman says Carroll opposed to make it """"easier to sue""""doctors and nurses. The Republican-sponsored bill granted immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics to help people in need. The Coffman ad is misleading. Carroll, who at the time was a House member, voted against the bill in committee after she and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association raised concerns that the proposed immunity was too broad and could shield a medical professional when a patient was harmed by gross negligence. However, Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to grant immunity to medical volunteers from civil liability when an """"act or omission of a volunteer"""" resulted in injury, except in cases of gross negligence, reckless misconduct and even violent crimes -- acts that would prevent a volunteer from receiving immunity under the federal Volunteer Protection Act. Ultimately, Carroll supported passage of the law that made it harder -- not easier -- to sue volunteer doctors, nurses and other health-medical professionals -- unless there was evidence of gross negligence. Coffman’s claim that Carroll made it easier to sue small businesses, refers to the """"Job Protection and Civil Rights Enforcement Act of 2013. """"Carroll was a primary sponsor of the bill. State law already allowed someone who prevailed in a complaint about employment discrimination or unfair employment practices before the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to sue for back pay, future pay, or to be reinstated or hired if they were improperly fired or denied a job. Carroll’s bill allowed victims of employment discrimination who win a lawsuit to also receive compensatory and punitive damages in cases where it was proved an employer engaged in intentional discrimination. In addition, the bill allowed an employee to be awarded attorney’s fees and costs. But if a judge found a lawsuit was frivolous -- or unjustified -- the court could award attorney’s fees and costs to the employer. The bill capped the maximum compensatory and punitive damages at $10,000 for a business with fewer than five employees, and $25,000 for an employer with five to 14 workers, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council’s fiscal analysis. The bill and the Legislative Council noted that while federal antidiscrimination laws allow compensatory and punitive damages, those laws don’t protect workers who are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or if their employer has fewer than 15 employees. Carroll’s state bill allowed people to seek the increased damages when their employer had less than 15 employees or there was discrimination based on sexual orientation. So the legislation, which became law, didn’t make it """"easier to sue"""" small businesses -- people could already do that -- but it did allow people the opportunity to win greater financial damages. What about Coffman’s accusation that Carroll engaged in a conflict of interest by voting on bills that financially benefited her work as a trial lawyer? We checked the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission’s records and found no evidence of an ethics complaint having been made against Carroll. The Legislature’s ethics rules state that a lawmaker has a personal or financial interest in legislation """"if the passage or failure of such bill, measure, or question will result in the member deriving a direct financial or pecuniary benefit that is greater than any such benefit derived by or shared by other persons in the member's profession, occupation, industry, or region."""" But a lawmaker will not be deemed to have a personal or financial interest in a bill that """"affects the entire membership of a class to which the member belongs."""" In a part-time """"citizen legislature"""" like Colorado’s, this generally allows a doctor/lawmaker to vote on a health care bill, a teacher to vote on an educational bill, and a builder to vote on a construction bill. Our ruling Coffman says Carroll’s votes on state legislation made """"it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."""" Carroll voted in committee against a bill to grant immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics. But Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to shield most medical volunteers from lawsuits — except in cases of gross negligence. Carroll did sponsor and vote for an anti-employment discrimination bill that didn’t make it easier to sue small businesses, because existing law already allowed such suits. But her bill did allow for the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees against employers of all sizes, including small businesses. Coffman accuses Carroll, who has worked as a lawyer handling disability, employment, workers’ compensation and personal injury cases, of being sleazy and shady with conflicts of interest. But there's no evidence she violated state ethics laws.""",1

Previously, only part of the baby’s DNA was thought to be in the mother’s blood. “Now that we know (the) entire foetal genome is in there, you can look for any disease that is genetically inherited.”   The study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Thursday, recruited a couple undergoing prenatal diagnosis for a hereditary blood disorder, beta-thalassemia. “In the mother’s blood, 90 percent of the DNA is her own ... and 10 percent is the baby’s. Half of the foetal genome is from father and half from mother,” Lo said. The team found the fetus inherited a beta-thalassemia mutant gene from the father, meaning the baby was a carrier of the disease. Lo described the process as akin to putting together a jigsaw puzzle with millions of pieces — only in this case, 10 times as many pieces from a much larger jigsaw were mixed in with it too. “The whole genome is fragmented into millions of pieces and by this exercise, we assemble it back,” Lo said. “It’s like assembling a jigsaw puzzle with millions of pieces. But to make it more challenging, you mix in 10 times (the number of pieces) from another jigsaw puzzle, that’s the mother’s own DNA. And you are trying to assemble the child’s.”   Experts who were not involved in the study called for caution. “It is too early to apply the technology widely as we are not yet able to interpret many of the results that can be generated accurately,” said Christine Patch, chair of the British Society for Human Genetics. “We do not randomly test pregnancies for a long list of ... conditions that may only manifest in adult life on the basis that individuals may not want to know that information when they are older.”",0
"""The Sharron Angle campaign calls its ad""""The Wave."""" But you may know it as the ad that prompted Joy Behar of ABC's The View to say: """"I'd like to see her do this ad in the south Bronx. Come here, b----. Come to New York and do it."""" Condemned in some Democratic and Hispanic circles as""""racist,""""the ad portrays Angle's opponent in the Nevada Senate race, Harry Reid, as a friend to illegal immigrants. Here's the text of the ad: """"Waves of illegal aliens streaming across our border joining violent gangs, forcing families to live in fear. And what is Harry Reid doing about it? Voting to give illegal aliens Social Security benefits, tax breaks and college tuition, voting against declaring English our national language twice and even siding with Obama and the president of Mexico to block Arizona's tough new immigration law. Harry Reid....it's clear whose side he's on, and it's not yours."""" In a fact-check of a previouscampaign ad, we dealt with Angle's claims that Reid voted to give illegal immigrants Social Security benefits (Barely ) and special tax breaks (False). Here, we're checking the claim that Reid voted against """"declaring English our national language, twice."""" During a big push for a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2006, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., proposed an amendment (S.AMDT.4064) """"to declare English as the national language of the United States and to promote the patriotic integration of prospective U.S. citizens."""" The amendment would have required all official government functions, including steps toward citizenship, to be conducted in English. It also sought to establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English, unless required by law. Arguing for the amendment, Inhofe said providing multilingual assistance costs the government more than $1 billion per year. Under the Inhofe's proposal, immigrants seeking to become permanent legal residents would have had to prove they had learned English. Reid made an impassioned speech from the Senate floor on May 18, 2006, denouncing the bill as """"racist"""" and """"divisive."""" Here's a sampling of some of his comments to give you a flavor of Reid's position:  -- """"While the intent may not be there, I really believe this amendment is racist. I think it is directed basically to people who speak Spanish."""" -- """"I think we should make sure that people who are 911 operators can immediately switch to somebody who can speak Spanish."""" -- """"Today, as I speak, the language of America is English. We want people to integrate, to learn English, but they need tools to do this no matter what their native language. This amendment takes some of those tools away, and we need all of those tools."""" -- """"The fastest growing component of adult education in America today is English as a second language. This will slow that down. This amendment impacts English speakers, reporting of crimes, reporting of diseases, involvement in commerce. Next, is it going to impact upon the right to vote?"""" -- """"This amendment is divisive. We should be here to unify our country, not divide it by ethnicity or language differences. I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Everyone who speaks with an accent knows that they need to learn English as fast as they can. Success in America means the ability to speak English. That is the way it is now. We don’t need this amendment. Speaking English is critical to the functioning of anyone in our country. It is the language of our government, of our nation, and as I have indicated before, air traffic controllers and diplomacy. This amendment, I believe, is unconstitutional. It raises serious concerns that American citizens could lose some of their rights."""" -- """"This amendment directly conflicts with several provisions of federal law, I believe, that guarantee the right of non-English-speaking students to learn English in our public schools."""" -- """"This amendment conflicts with provisions of federal law that require language materials or assistance to be provided to voters in some areas of non-English languages, where there is evidence of educational discrimination resulting in high illiteracy and low registration turnout."""" -- """"There has been substantial evidence of harassment, intimidation, even violence against language minority voters.

This is divisive, it is mean spirited. I think it is the wrong way to go."""" So tell us how you really feel about the amendment, Senator. Needless to say, Reid voted against it, but with the help of 11 Democrats, the amendment passed 62-35. Interestingly, the Senate also passed a subsequent amendment (S.AMDT.4073) proposed by then Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., """"to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States, and to preserve and enhance the role of the English language."""" Reid voted for that amendment, which passed by a vote of 58 to 39. The immigration reform bill did not pass that year, however, and when a second stab at comprehensive immigration reform was undertaken in 2007, Inhofe again proposed an amendment (S.AMDT.1151) """"to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States, and for other purposes."""" Reid again voted against it, though the measure passed 64-33. But that immigration reform bill never came to pass either. To this day, no """"official language"""" exists at the federal level. The bottom line here is that Reid twice voted against amendments to """"declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States,"""" even as he voted for an amendment """"to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States."""" The ad says Reid twice voted against declaring English our national language. Reid not only voted against the bills, he was quite vocal in his opposition. We rate the ad's claim .""",0
"""Texas women are paid less than men, Wendy Davis stresses. In a March 10, 2014, tweet, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee pointed out that her Republican opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott, passed up a chance to say whether he would have vetoed a Davis-sponsored measure related to ensuring equal pay for Texas women that didn’t make it into law. Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, wrote: """"While @GregAbbott_TX dodges questions on the Texas Equal Pay Act, women are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in Texas."""" We’ll leave it to Abbott and Davis to debate the 2013 measure vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry. But we wondered: Are Texas women still paid 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man? We found that pay gaps persist, though comparisons can be dicey. Comparing women and men doing 'same' job In August 2013, we rated a related Davis claim: """"Texas women make an average of $8,355 less per year than men doing the very same job."""" That’s not necessarily correct for individuals doing the same job. In 2010, $8,355 was the general gap between median salaries of full-time working Texas men and women, according to federal estimates, and the 2012 gap was nearly $500 less than that. Significantly, the research cited by Davis did not drill down to salaries for men and women doing the same jobs. In contrast, 2013 survey results indicated a $2,000 gap between the median pay for Texas men and women with comparable professional experiences holding the same or similar jobs. Annual U.S. Census Bureau surveys But Davis’ recent """"82 cents"""" claim wasn’t specific to people doing the same jobs. Responding to our request for back-up information, Davis spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña pointed us to an April 2013 """"fact sheet"""" from the National Partnership for Women & Families, an advocacy group for workplace fairness and other issues. The sheet opens: """"In Texas, on average, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid $35,301 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $43,160 per year. This means that women in Texas are paid 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to a yearly gap of $7,859 between men and women who work full time in the state."""" That statement is footnoted to the one-year American Community Survey undertaken in 2011 by the U.S Census Bureau and a bureau chart indicating median earnings in the past 12 months by sex by work experience for residents 16 and older. These aligned with the partnership’s fact sheet. Latest available estimate Kliner pointed out, too, that comparable results based on the 2012 ACS were posted online by the bureau in September 2013. The 2012 estimates indicate that median earnings for Texas men who worked full time year-round in the past 12 months were $44,802; for Texas women meeting these criteria, median earnings were $35,453 — or 79 cents for every dollar earned by men who worked full time. Because Davis said women """"still"""" earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, we calculated the comparable figure for previous years, according to the bureau’s surveys. We found the comparable figure to be 80 cents in 2006, 2009 and 2010, 79 cents in 2007 and 78 cents in 2008. Separately, we downloaded a bureau chart showing slightly different estimated median earnings for full-time male and female civilian workers in Texas based on the bureau’s 2012 survey. The resulting chart indicated a median wage for full-time working men of--$45,166 for men, $35,518 for women. By this metric, we calculated, civilian full-time female workers in Texas earned an estimated 79 cents for each dollar earned by full-time male workers. In 2011, a bureau chart suggests, the comparable figure was 81 cents. Kliner told us the partnership relies on bureau estimates not limited to civilian workers because it believes that delivers a more complete view of the workforce. """"It is also the chart that has been used historically, so it allows for comparisons over time,"""" she wrote. Upshot: The latest available estimate is that Texas women working full time earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by such men in 2012. That was a penny better than in one of the previous six years, the same or a penny less than the result in four of the years and three cents less than the 82 cents estimated for 2011 and relied upon by Davis. Experts note caveats Experts we queried agreed with our math while offering caveats. By email, Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, pointed out that any focus on earnings for full-time workers leaves out part-time workers. Women, he wrote, are more likely to be employed part-time. Still, Potter said, """"if we just looked at part-time workers, again, you’d probably find women earn less."""" In our 2013 fact check, we noted there’s a range of how many hours full-time workers log, and men are more likely than women to be on the job for 41 hours or more per week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because more men work overtime, that should translate into higher earnings for them -- because they are paid more, or because their longer hours lead to more job success -- and contribute to the wage gap. Though more nuanced analysis shows that job differences explain much of the pay gap, experts agree that much of it still cannot be accounted for. That’s where sexism comes in, some say. """"Finally,"""" Potter said, """"the differential quoted probably is not adjusted for educational attainment or work experience."""" It is not. """"If it were, we’d probably find the differential would shrink (toward equality) as women tend to have less work experience than men though educational attainment is fairly comparable among adults across sex."""" Austin economist Stuart Greenfield similarly said by email: """"In the aggregate, Sen. Davis’ statement is absolutely, positively correct,"""" though he said that """"when one controls for work experience, education, and other factors, the earnings’ differential is reduced."""" National comparisons Greenfield also pointed out a Dec. 2, 2013, Bureau of Labor Statistics press release summarizing median-pay changes among full-time workers over the years: """"In Texas, the ratio of women’s to men’s earnings trended upward from 1997 to 2004. It then fluctuated from 2005 to 2009 before climbing to a series high of 85.6 percent in 2010. However, in the last two years the Texas women’s to men’s earnings ratio has declined 6.0 percentage points to its lowest level since 2001."""" According to the 2012 survey results, Texas women fared better compared to men in their state than women in 24 states. Arizona placed first; women working full time earned 87 cents for every dollar earned by men. (For more than a decade, the graph indicates, Texas women fared better than their male counterparts in the state compared to women versus men in the nation as a whole, though conditions dipped in Texas compared to the nation in 2011 and 2012. We asked Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to speak to why this was so. See her reply here.) Jennifer Lee, a researcher for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, which focuses on programs serving low-income Texans, said of the 79-cent pay difference estimate suggested by the 2012 survey: """"This is how the ‘wage gap’ is usually calculated. If you expand who you’re looking at to include all employed individuals (whether or not they work full-time or year-round), women earn 71 cents for every dollar that a man earns,"""" Lee said by email. Lee reminded us of a February 2007 paper by Cornell University labor economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, """"The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone Far Enough?"""" The paper states that 53 percent of the gender wage gap stems from variation in job, industry and union status between the genders. According to the paper, major reasons for such wage gaps include: Occupational and industry category (49% of the reason) – Lee said that many women are concentrated in particular occupations. Occupations that are heavily female, such as health care support or personal care and service occupations, tend to pay low wages, she said. For example, home health aides in Texas, who are largely female, earn on average $17,430 per year, Lee said, while women also represent 63% of workers earning minimum-wage or less in Texas. When you break down earnings data by occupation, she said, this gap persists in almost all occupations. Labor Force Experience (10.5%) – A portion of the gap is explained by factors related to work experience, such as interruptions in work for child care, Lee said. Unexplained (41%) – Lee said a large portion of the gap is unexplained by women’s choices. This could be because of conscious or unconscious biases (research shows this is particularly acute against mothers), Lee wrote, while other research shows that different attitudes around wage negotiations may contribute to the gender wage gap. Lee added: """"A lot of people see occupational choices and time off from work as women’s choices. And while this is true, I think it’s important to realize that the choices we make are heavily influenced by the environment in which we make choices, the choices that are available, and how those choices are presented. So while it’s true that more women work in low-wage jobs, there may be reasons why women don’t choose to work in some higher-wage occupations. Similarly, mothers may choose to take time off work to care for young children, but perhaps they wouldn’t if child care were more available or affordable."""" Our ruling Davis said that Texas women are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in the state. Her figure, based on a 2011 federal survey, reflects median earnings for adults who worked full time in the past 12 months, leaving out part-time workers. It’s also outdated in that according to the latest available survey, taken in 2012, Texas women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men (again working full time in the past 12 months), less than what Davis said. We rate this claim as . – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""",0
"For decades, scientists have alleged a connection between aluminum and Alzheimer’s disease, and whether such a link exists has been the subject of a long-standing debate within the scientific community. (Indeed, when silent film great Rudolph Valentino passed away from a perforated ulcer in 1926, rumor held that his demise was caused by his consuming food prepared in aluminum cookware.) The more specific claim about the health dangers cooking with aluminum foil often pops up in viral news stories, such as one published on clickbait site awm.com under the headline “Doctors Now Have Warning: If You Use Aluminum Foil, Stop It or Face Deadly Consequences,” which made the following argument: Simply put, if you cook with aluminum foil, you are playing with your health. The first thing you need to know is that aluminum is bad for your brain. It is a neurotoxic heavy metal that has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease for years. This claim rests on three assertions. First, that cooking with aluminum foil will liberate aluminum and be transferred to your food in a form that can be ingested; second, that this aluminum will reach your brain in concentrations high enough to be significant; and third, that high concentrations of aluminum in your brain put you at increased risk of Alzheimer’s. Will cooking with aluminum foil liberate aluminum? Yes, acids typically dissolve metals, and aluminum is no exception. A 2012 study published in the International Journal of Electrochemical Science, which is often cited in viral news stories because of its more alarmist claims about Alzheimer’s, investigated how much aluminum was liberated through the process of cooking food in foil. Not surprisingly, researchers found the amount varied depending upon factors such as temperature and acidity, but that some aluminum did, in fact, leach into food cooked in foil: Aluminum foil used in cooking provides an easy channel for the metal to enter the human body. The increase in cooking temperature causes more leaching. The leaching is also highly dependent on the pH value of the food solution, salt, and spices added to the food solutions. How much of that leached aluminum would stay in your body? Not much — most research on the topic agrees that it’s much less than 1%. A 2011 report published in the journal Neuroscience stated that “healthy humans and laboratory rats absorb between 0.06% and 0.4% of ingested Al”. Could some of that ~0.4% of leached aluminum make it to your brain? Based on studies that directly injected rats with high doses of aluminum, the answer is yes, but not much. According to the World Health Organization, once the aluminum does make it into your bloodstream, a very small percentage (of an already small percentage of ingested aluminum) actually ends up in your brain: “Approximately 60, 25, 10, 3 and 1% of the aluminium body burden is in the bone, lung, muscle, liver and brain, respectively.” The amount of aluminum you would need to eat on a regular basis to see much of a buildup in your brain is unrealistically large. But, for the sake of argument, let’s say some of that leached aluminum does get into your brain. Will it increase your risk factor for Alzheimer’s? The debate over a connection between aluminum and Alzheimer’s has gone on for decades, originally inspired by the observation that the brains of Alzheimer’s patients have high concentrations of aluminum compounds and that a major symptom of the disease is the buildup of plaque that contains aluminum compounds. At the moment the field remains mixed on the role of aluminum as a possible risk factor for Alzheimer’s. Both the Alzheimer’s Society of Canada and the international Alzheimer’s Association’s official stance is that aluminum is not a risk factor for the disease. A 2008 CDC toxicology report describes the scientific consensus as follows: Although a possible association was proposed over 40 years ago, this association is still highly controversial and there is little consensus regarding current evidence. A number of studies have found weak associations between living in areas with elevated aluminum levels in drinking water and an increased risk (or prevalence) of Alzheimer’s disease; other studies have not found significant associations. In contrast, no significant associations have been found between tea consumption or antacid use and the risk of Alzheimer’s disease; although the levels of aluminum in tea and antacids are very high compared to drinking water, aluminum from these sources is poorly absorbed. The available data do not suggest that aluminum is a causative agent of Alzheimer’s disease; however, it is possible that it may play a role in the disease development.",1
"No cost information was provided, even though the drug is already on the market for another condition. According to GoodRx, one 80 mg auto-injector of the drug costs around $4,700. We are told that “19.5 percent of patients who received only the placebo injections were judged to have met the trial’s specified clinical endpoint — at least a 20 percent reduction in the number of tender and swollen joints — the response rate among those getting the real drug every four weeks was 53.3 percent. Those getting the drug every two weeks didn’t do any better and were slightly more prone to side effects, such as a mild reaction at the injection site.” This is an adequate discussion of the drug’s benefits. We learn that “few serious adverse events were reported for patients receiving the drug, or the placebo” but a close reading of the actual abstract shows that 7 percent of patients taking the drug every two weeks (versus 3 percent on placebo) had serious adverse events. If the absolute effects on benefits are reported why are not the absolute effects of the harms? We think it is important to at least list the major adverse events that occurred during the trial. We learn that this is a randomized, blinded, three-armed, multi-site study that lasted 24 weeks, which is a sufficient description of the quality of evidence. We wish the release had mentioned that it remains uncertain how patients on the drug would fare long-term, beyond the 6 months of the trial. There is no disease mongering. The release provides strong context on the condition as well as how the drug is believed to work. The release states that the manufacturer paid for the trial and the key spokesperson, the principle investigator served as a consultant to Eli Lilly. There was a good explanation about the alternatives — drugs like the TNF inhibitors already on the market such as adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab — but that “only about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better.” We also learn that “another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.” The release notes that the drug has been FDA approved and is available for patients with psoriasis and that Lily has applied for FDA approval for use in patients with psoriatic arthritis as well. The release does an acceptable job of describing the drug’s place in the treatment landscape. It does not make an outward claim of novelty, but it appears to be the first such randomized trial for this type of arthritis. There are no examples of unjustified language.",0
"""Democrats ripping jobs gains under Republican Gov. Scott Walker often point to the post-recession progress in Minnesota, where the jobs recovery has outpaced that of Wisconsin. Walker, meanwhile, prefers comparisons to Illinois and its budget problems and big tax hikes. In September 2013, we rated a Minnesota lawmaker’s claim that the Gopher State is """"kicking butt relative to Wisconsin"""" on employment, school test scores, workforce education and other rankings. But we haven’t, until now, tested claims of an income gap. Gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke proclaimed such a gap in June 6, 2014 remarks to delegates gathered in Lake Delton for the state Democratic Party’s annual convention. """"As you know,"""" Burke said, """"our current governor has made quite a name for himself. His divisive brand of politics may have made national headlines, but those policies have hurt middle-class families right here in Wisconsin."""" She added: """"But the people of Wisconsin, we know Scott Walker. He promised us 250,000 new jobs. But what did we get? We’re 9th out of 10 midwestern states in job growth -- ninth out of 10! And the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota."""" Let’s see if Burke’s statement about a Minnesota advantage in the Walker era holds up. What the numbers show Burke’s campaign cited one source for numbers on earnings. We looked at it and two others. All show Minnesota on top. -- The annual average wage of Minnesota workers was $47,370 as of May 2013 -- $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin, according to survey-based estimates published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2013 data is the most recent available. -- Average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin’s $48,997, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That figure takes in a larger group -- not only workers’ wages and salaries but """"proprietor’s income"""" from self-employment. -- The same data, stripped down to exclude proprietor’s income to focus more on regular salaries and wages, shows a gap of $5,757 in Minnesota’s favor, according to research by Dale Knapp at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. So Burke’s figures are solid. More about the numbers In her convention speech, Burke argued in a general way that Walker’s policies are linked to the wage gap. Given all the factors that influence a state’s economy, experts agree the actions of a governor have a limited effect. Nevertheless, Burke’s claim misses the mark by pinning the gap solely on Walker. The Minnesota-Wisconsin wage gap dates to at least the 1960s, and gradually has grown despite ups and downs. When we asked Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki about that, he argued that Walker's economic policies -- which Walker touts as turning the state around -- haven't improved it or closed that gap. As examples, he cited Walker’s refusal to accept the federal expansion of Medicaid and his opposition to a minimum wage increase. By any of our three measures, the gap did not narrow in Walker’s first two years. It grew significantly based on the average earnings per job data. It held steady if you use the other two methods. The average earnings data shows the Minnesota wage advantage averaged 7.4 percent during the second four-year term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who preceded Walker. So far under Walker the average is 8.8 percent. The gap of 9.1 percent in 2012, Walker’s second year, is the highest since 2000, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was in charge. It’s not that Wisconsin’s average wage has fallen during the Walker era. It’s up 5.5 percent in two years, right around the national average increase. But Minnesota has fared somewhat better, which creates the increase in the gap. In combing through the annual average wage data for the two states, there are some interesting disparities between specific jobs. Minnesota ran up part of its lead on these: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Registered nurse $71,160 $64,460 Management, all positions $107,130 $97,920 Dentist $193,100 $177,430 Police and sheriff patrol officer $58,220 $54,140 Social worker (child/family/school) $59,830 $49,720 School bus driver $32,500 $29,190 Computer systems analyst $81,560 $75,170 Lawyer $126,520 $105,080  Wisconsin holds the upper hand in other categories, including: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Farm, fishing, forestry $30,910 $31,260 Retail Salesperson $23,730 $24,420 Mortician, undertaker, funeral director $58,340 $65,720 Chiropractor $72,810 $90,170 Pediatrician $185,550 $200,480 According to a bankrate.com calcuator, the Minneapolis area’s cost of living is 8.5% higher than that of the Milwaukee metro area. Our rating Burke told delegates at the state Democratic convention that """"the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota"""" under Walker’s policies. The gap is real and Burke hit the mark with her description of it. The gap has grown or held steady in Walker’s time depending on the measuring stick used. Burke didn’t say Walker created the gap, but the disparity is a longstanding one, and one that existed and grew under governors of both political stripes. We rate her claim .""",0
"""At a Los Angeles anti-abortion rally, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said """"folks in Washington"""" have failed """"to protect citizens at every stage in life."""" In President Barack Obama’s first week in office, Perry said, he """"chose to overturn the ‘Mexico City Policy,’ which basically means that your federal tax dollars can now be used to fund abortions all over the world."""" Perry’s June 12 statement landed in national news stories, including reports by National Public Radio and the Associated Press; readers asked us whether Perry was correct. Back story: Obama rescinded what is known as the Mexico City Policy on his third day as president in January 2009, according to news accounts posted online. The policy, first put in place by President Ronald Reagan, requires foreign nongovernmental groups getting U.S. family planning funds to agree that they will not perform or """"actively promote"""" abortion as a method of family planning outside of the United States, even if using money from other sources. Those family planning grants are distributed through the U.S. Agency for International Development and are used to fund a variety of activities, including distribution of contraceptives and training of health care workers. Groups may also use the funds to provide emergency treatment for women who have been hurt by or become ill from an abortion. The Reagan administration announced the expanded restrictions at the 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City (the source of the policy’s name), saying that the United States """"does not consider abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs and will no longer contribute to those of which it is a part."""" Since then, the Mexico City Policy has been in place during Republican administrations and repealed during Democratic ones. According to a 2001 Congressional Research Service report, the policy defined abortion promotion — banned under the Mexico City Policy — as working """"to increase the availability or use of abortion as a method of family planning."""" Prohibited activities included operating a counseling service that includes information on the benefits and availability of abortion, advising someone that abortion is available and lobbying a foreign government to legalize abortion as a method of family planning. The policy allowed for several exceptions. Among them: A group receiving U.S. funds was allowed to perform abortions if a woman’s life was threatened or if a pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. Aid recipients could also continue to treat women who had been injured during legal or illegal abortions So, is Perry correct that the policy’s 2009 removal by Obama means federal tax dollars can fund abortions all over the world? Not so, says Ellen Starbird, deputy director of USAID’s office of population and reproductive health, because regardless of the Mexico City Policy, a 1973 federal law known as the Helms amendment prohibits U.S. foreign aid from paying for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries. A 2010 CRS report says that after 1973 but before the Mexico City Policy came to be, no U.S. funds could be used directly to pay for abortion as a method of family planning abroad, though in countries where abortion was legal, foreign NGOs receiving U.S. aid could use other money to perform them. In those cases, the report says, the groups were required to keep """"segregated accounts for U.S. money in order to demonstrate compliance with the abortion restrictions."""" Once the Mexico City Policy was in place, groups that wanted U.S. family planning aid couldn’t provide abortions, regardless of the funding source. Conversely, now that the policy has been lifted, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning aid. Seems straightforward. But as we’ve learned with other abortion-related fact-checks, it’s not. After learning about the funding restrictions in the Helms amendment, we circled back to Perry’s office. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier stood by Perry’s statement, saying that """"if U.S. taxpayer money is going to groups that provide abortions, regardless of any other services they provide, it’s going toward promoting and funding abortions."""" Likewise, Kellie Fiedorek, a lawyer for Americans United for Life, a pro-life advocacy group, told us that without the policy intact, """"Americans’ tax dollars may still go to NGOs that provide abortions."""" Austin Ruse, president of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, a pro-life think tank, told us that a group’s ability to move its money around is the key to assessing whether Perry’s statement is accurate. """"If you believe money is fungible, then what Perry said is true,"""" Ruse said. That concern also has played prominently in debates in Congress and statehouses over providing domestic abortion providers with funding for other services. Proponents of the Mexico City Policy also say that groups newly getting USAID money for family planning can then free up other funds for abortions. USAID spokesman Nicole Schiegg told us that the agency """"has a robust compliance system in place to ensure that our funds are not used for prohibited activities."""" Starbird told us that if a foreign NGO that provides abortions receives U.S. family planning aid, it is required to keep that money separate from its own. The groups are not allowed """"free rein"""" with the funds, she said. Starbird said each award to a foreign NGO is for a specific purpose, and written agreements specify limits such as the Helms’ restriction. She also said recipients are required to account for how the funds are spent, including any money awarded for overhead or indirect costs, and USAID workers monitor the programs. For longer perspective, we asked Barbara Crane, an author of a 2001 article on the Mexico City Policy for Science magazine, about Perry’s statement and the funding issues raised by the policy’s proponents. Crane, a former USAID employee working for Ipas, an international NGO that supports abortion rights, suggested the government takes a chance on money being misspent whenever it makes an award. Crane said, though, that if the government holds groups accountable for delivering the services for which the aid money was awarded, """"there is little opportunity for … the organization to divert funds to support current or new activities in other areas."""" We unsuccessfully sought independent research into how foreign NGOs have spent USAID family-planning money. Separately, Perry’s office offered no evidence of U.S. family planning funds enabling particular NGOs to perform abortions. We also could not determine how many foreign NGOs receive U.S. family planning aid and also perform abortions. Starbird told us that the agency doesn’t ask groups seeking family planning money whether they provide abortions. But Crane, of Ipas, speculated that most don’t engage in abortion-related activities, and many are working in nations that have strict abortion laws. Where does that leave us? With the policy’s repeal, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning money. However, longstanding federal law bars any aid from being spent on abortions, and USAID polices how its family-planning grants are spent. But Perry’s statement retains a sliver of truth in that it’s possible some aid could be misspent or that U.S. aid could free up other money to go toward abortions. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to .""",1
"On 20 December 2015 a female driver (later identified as a 24-year-old Oregon woman named Lakeisha Holloway) reportedly struck multiple pedestrians with her vehicle on the Las Vegas strip. One individual, 32-year-old Jessica Valenzuela, died in the accident: Woman from Oregon in her 20s is driver of Oldsmobile according to @LVMPD – her 3 y/o was in back. Confirmed intentional act @KTNNews — Jacqui Heinrich (@JacquiHeinrich) December 21, 2015  On 21 December 2015, the notoriously unreliable web site Before It’s News published an article reporting that Holloway had shouted “Allahu Akbar” (Arabic for “Allah is great”) during the incident:  According to one eye witness “As we were walking across the street, this car comes flying through the red light. She ran up on the sidewalk and smashed into a group of people walking accross the street and into the group of people at the corner. She did not slow down and appeared to accelerate as she hit the sidewalk.” According to that witness. there is a huge row of plants and bushes separating the sidewalk and the strip, but the woman driver ran through both, at a speed he guessed to be 40-45 miles per hour. “People were flying off the front of her car and people were smashing into other people as she plowed through the crowd.” The witness went on to say “As this unfolded, the only thing I recall as this happened is the insane sound of her car accelerating and the voice from the car was screaming ‘Allah Akbar!’ I’ve heard the sound enough times on the news that I was waiting for a bomb to blow up or guns to start firing.” This was an act of Islamic Terrorism, perpetrated by an Islamic woman driving a car with a three year old child inside, who INTENTIONALLY rode onto the sidewalk to strike innocent people. Police, however, have been instructed by their superiors to NOT use the word “terrorism” in relation to this incident, because Las Vegas does not want tourists to be frightened away from the city. Witness:Female Killer In #LasVegas Shouted 'Allahu Akbar'As She Ran Over 37 Innocent Pple Last Night https://t.co/g1UeFwVigt #tcot @foxnews — Patty (@littlebytesnews) December 21, 2015  The claim appeared concurrently on numerous questionable websites (all with identical wording), but we found no version of that claim reported by a credible news site. Although Las Vegas police didn’t release any specifics about what motive might have been behind Holloway’s deadly actions, media reports hinted at a non-terroristic impetus:  #BREAKING Strip suspect to police: “I am hurting, and I want others to feel my pain!” Coverage on News 3 Live @ 3 pic.twitter.com/b5DBgzbbrk — NBC KSNV News 3 (@News3LV) December 21, 2015  On 21 December 2015, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) issued a press release [PDF] about the incident which stated that: About 30 minutes after the initial incident was reported, an adult female, later identified as 24-year old Lakeisha Holloway, went to the valet area of the Tuscany Hotel located at 255 East Flamingo Road, and asked an employee to call the police. It was believed Holloway was involved in the incident on the Strip and she was taken into custody without incident. A three-year old female was in the vehicle with Holloway who was believed to be her daughter. The child was uninjured and was turned over to Child Protective Services where they will assist in locating other family members. The investigation indicated this incident was intentional and as a result of the investigation initiated by multiple details of the LVMPD, Holloway was arrested and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department transported to the Clark County Detention Center where she currently faces the following charges: – Murder with a Deadly Weapon – Child Abuse or Neglect (felony) – Leaving the Scene of an Accident (felony) Once the remaining victims’ statements and medical records are put together, it is anticipated that Holloway will face a multitude of other charges. LVMPD published video of a press conference to Facebook on 21 December 2015:  Just heading to Absinthe; the show at Ceasars Palace. Was walking down the strip heading to our show; as we parked at the Paris for dinner and walked down the street to go to the show. As we were walking accross the street, this car comes flying through the red light, we had right of way and walking accross the intersection, she ran up on the sidewalk and smashed into a group of people walking accross the street and into the group of people at the corner. She did not slow down and appeared to accelerate as she hit the sidewalk. There’s a huge row of plants and bushes seperating the sidewalk and the strip, she ran through both, probably 40-45 miles per hour. People were flying off the front of her car and people were smashing into other people as she plowed through the crowd. My friend was walking ahead of us as he was making a joke of the minion characters that were lined up on the sidewalk, wanted to pose for a picture, the car hit a bush and the bush smacked into his legs; he buckled from the impact and fell down in writhing pain. He is listed as one of the 36 injured but I will not name his name. We spent the last 5 hours on the strip giving our report to police and this is the first chance I’ve had to come on here and post. I’ve been following this story HERE as I know this is the only place to get the REAL news! As this unfolded, the only thing I recall as this happened is the insane sound of her car accelerating and the voice from the car was screaming Allah Akbar! I’ve heard the sound enough times on the news and posts on here that I was waiting for a bomb to blow up or guns to start firing. My friends ducked into the Hard Rock Casino which is right by the Paris and waited to see if something else was going to happen. After 30 minutes we went back to the street with total chaos, cops and ambulances shutting everything down and a systematic closure of casinos closely. We were told to leave if able, and not to linger but more and more people gathered to see what was going on. I thought this shit wouldn’t hit Vegas but I am first hand proof that’s it’s here, in Sin City with evil Islam at its roots! This bitch was crazy and was screaming with both windows down! I didn’t notice a kid in the car but after reading the news that a toddler was in there it makes me sick! I’m coming down from an adrenaline rush like I’ve never had. I’m ex-Air Force and I wish I was active duty so I could FRY these fuckin radicals from my country! Watch yourselves people; they come out of no-where and will hit you where you least expect it! I don’t think it’s a coincidence it was in front of the Paris either, fuck these fucking terrorists!! Our attempts to contact the official public information department of the LVMPD have so far been unsuccessful, probably due to the large ongoing investigation into the Vegas strip incident of 20 December 2015. However, an individual in the Homicide division with whom we briefly spoke confirmed that potential ties to Islamic terrorism are not currently a focus of the investigation. The rumor’s credibility deficit was so severe that even an InfoWars article described it as “from a dubious source [which] cannot be considered genuine at this time.” On 21 December 2015, the LVMPD repeatedly addressed iterations of the rumor on Twitter and implored social media users not to spread misinformation about the tragedy: @SuperStation95 In times like these it is irresponsible to spread misinformation. There is no evidence that was said, as it did not happen. — LVMPD (@LVMPD) December 22, 2015  @PatriotBroker This is false and we have addressed the misinformation with @SuperStation95. — LVMPD (@LVMPD) December 22, 2015  @Proud__Infidel There is zero evidence that was shouted as it did not happen.

"Nutrition and weight loss, preventative and personalized health, complementary and alternative medicine, and beauty and anti-aging treatments were the biggest growing sectors, the report compiled by the non-profit research center SRI International showed. “All across the world we have seen, from Asia to Europe to Africa to North America, more and more people are consciously thinking about healthy food, exercising, looking to nature, getting massages and doing yoga,” said Ophelia Yeung, a senior consultant for SRI International who led the study. Spa treatments and products, alternative and complementary treatments and weight-loss programs once considered beyond the means of many people, she added, are becoming more mainstream with a growing middle class. While medical care treats illness and disease, wellness is focused on prevention through a variety of healthy habits, nutritional eating, exercise and treatments. To compile the report researchers looked at wellness sectors ranging from mind and body fitness to beauty and anti-aging, spas and workplace wellness. The global spa industry generated $94 billion last year, according to the Global Spa and Wellness Economy Monitor report, up from $60 billion in 2007. With more than 32,000 spas, Europe had the highest revenue of $29.8 billion, followed by the Asia-Pacific region with $18.8 billion and North America with $18.3 billion. Emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa have been growing the fastest in terms of adding spas. In Asia, China and India are leading growth, while in Europe it is Eastern Europe, Russia and the Baltic states. Thermal/mineral springs generated $50 billion worldwide but the biggest industry sector was wellness tourism, or travel associated with maintaining or enhancing one’s personal well-being and health, which accounted for $494 billion. “Wellness travel is a very fast growing segment within travel. That’s because as people become more conscious about a healthy lifestyle they naturally want to extend that when they travel,” Yeung explained. The report showed that the number of people taking international and domestic wellness tourism trips grew by 12 percent from 2012 to 2013. That was 36 percent faster than overall tourism trip growth, which is estimated at 9 percent. The SRI report was commissioned by the annual Global Spa & Wellness Summit. More than 400 wellness industry leaders from 45 countries attended the 2014 summit in Morocco earlier this month.",0
"On 28 December 2017, a tweet from a man in California focused attention on one of less-reported aftereffects of the damage caused by the massive Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico on 20 September 2017. Ben Boyer’s post criticized the Trump administration’s response to the disaster while describing a recent hospital visit: My wife’s nurse had to stand for 30 mins & administer a drug slowly through a syringe because there are almost no IV bags in the continental U.S. anymore. See, they were all manufactured in a Puerto Rican factory which still isn’t fixed. Meanwhile that stupid swollen prick golfs. This is true. Hospitals in both Puerto Rico and the mainland United States have reported shortages of intravenous fluids and bags since Maria tore through the island — where several medical manufacturing plants are located — in September 2017. According to a Food and Drug Administration analysis released in November 2017, medical manufacturing is a significant part of the island’s economy: Prior to the devastation brought by Hurricane Maria, the medical product manufacturing sector provided, on average, approximately $800 million in local wages over a 12-month period, according to our analysis. This manufacturing industry is a key part of the island’s manufacturing base and is supported by a highly skilled workforce. Among the manufacturers affected was Baxter International, the largest IV bag supplier in the United States; the company says on its website that it ships more than a million units of IV solutions a day. The FDA responded by saying that Baxter and other companies to get priority access to the island territory’s electrical grid. On 28 December 2017, the FDA sent us the following statement: The FDA has been working very closely with industry and local and federal officials to help address the shortage situation for IV saline and other products as a result of Hurricane Maria. This remains a key area of focus for the agency and we expect that the shortage of IV fluids will improve in early 2018 based on the information we are receiving from the manufacturers. In the meantime, we are continuing all of our efforts to increase supplies while concerns remain. Baxter sent us a statement confirming that all of its facilities in the territory are connected to the local electrical grid, with backup diesel generators on tap in case of power outages. The company said it expects to “return to more normal supply levels for products made in Puerto Rico in the coming weeks.” The company did clarify, however, that its Puerto Rican operations did not include manufacture of saline IV solutions, and that production of those products continues to run normally. Baxter added: We are also bringing additional units to the U.S. market through a recent permanent approval from the FDA for IVs produced in one of our North American manufacturing plants. We expect to see this incremental supply benefitting current customers and providing us the opportunity to service other customers in the beginning of 2018. The FDA said in a follow-up statement released on 5 January 2018: FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said a key area of focus is addressing the I.V. saline shortage, which has affected patients, health care providers, and hospitals. He noted that, based on information from the companies, the shortage of I.V. saline fluids is expected to improve early this year. The number of deaths caused by the hurricane remains unclear. Although Puerto Rican authorities initially reported that around 50 people had been killed in the territory as a result of Maria, several accounts have surfaced contradicting that estimate. In early December 2017, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló ordered a recount of the death toll. He said in a statement: We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody. Boyer told us via email that his wife was receiving the treatment as part of her ongoing care for brain cancer; she was first diagnosed in 2009, and her tumor (which is inoperable) became aggressive again in 2015. At the time of his post, he said, he was unaware of the ongoing IV bag shortage: Obviously I knew about the hurricane; I lived in San Juan as a little kid and have been back to Puerto Rico many times. Both my parents worked their whole careers in health care and I knew that was part of the island but didn’t know about the current situation until our excellent nurse told me. At the time he was giving my wife her pre-meds before her chemo infusion – steroids, stomach aids, saline flush, etc. He said of the attention his tweet received: Twitter is very weird in that it’s very hard to tell how something blew up – I know it only had a couple of likes and comments for the first 5 or 6 hours and then clearly some big account RTd it – I wish I knew who it was! After that I started to see lots more RTs including several big names I recognized. As you can see from my account, I mostly tweet dumb jokes, but this was just such a wild thing and I hadn’t heard it from anyone else so I thought it would be informative. Very soon after it started to spread I started seeing lots of nurses and medical professionals jumping on it and I realized that (a) it was a story most people didn’t know about, and (b) it was clearly massively widespread and growing.",0
"""When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called state lawmakers into special session on Sept. 28, 2011, he touted two dozen legislative initiatives he said would put Wisconsin back to work. Reiterating his campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, the Republican governor asserted that more than anything else, """"employers and workers want a sense of certainty."""" Health care advocate Robert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin, was certain he didn’t like what he saw in some of the bills on the table. Kraig’s Milwaukee-based group describes itself as a coalition that works to """"advance progressive values and shape the public and political debate around health care, economic development and consumer protection."""" In a news release and in a blog post on Oct. 3, 2011, Kraig said several bills were """"masquerading as job-creation measures which damage the civil justice rights of consumers who are injured by corporate malfeasance"""" -- in other words, curbing the rights of injured people to sue. """"Shockingly,"""" Kraig added, """"one bill in the current session dangerously grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products."""" Immunity from lawsuits -- even in cases of injury and death? The bill Kraig criticized was proposed by Sen. Rich Zipperer, R-City of Pewaukee. As long as a drug or device is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturer or seller of that drug or medical device would be immune from liability, according to the non-partisan Legislative Reference Bureau. Zipperer spokewoman Hannah Huffman said, however, that there are exceptions. Immunity would not apply if FDA approval were gained through fraud, she said. And although manufacturers could not be sued for a defect in the design of a drug or device if the design had been approved by the FDA, the manufacturer could be sued if it failed to follow the design in the manufacturing process, she said. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families in Washington, D.C., told us she believes the immunity bill would apply to all drugs but perhaps not to all medical devices. Zuckerman, who has done research on the FDA approval processes, said it would depend on how the word approved is interpreted in the bill. Every year, only about 3 percent of new medical devices gain FDA approval, while the rest are """"cleared"""" under a less-stringent process by the agency, she said. So, Zipperer’s bill gives broad immunity, with some exceptions, to drug makers but perhaps less immunity to device makers. We asked Kraig for evidence to back what essentially was a blanket statement that the bill """"grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity."""" Kraig initially said his statement was """"over broad and should have included the qualification that this bill covers drugs and medical devices approved by the FDA."""" Later he argued the statement was fair because most people, when they hear a reference to drug makers or medical device manufacturers, would understand that those companies make products that in the vast majority of cases must be approved by the FDA. Kraig also argued that the bill is dangerous because in recent years the FDA’s regulatory powers have been weakened and therefore its approval of a drug or device does not provide as much protection as it once did. As evidence, he cited a report that is critical of a Michigan law that gives immunity to drug manufacturers and that Kraig said is similar to the drug manufacturers part of the Wisconsin’s bill. And he cited a national report on problems people encountered after using drugs and medical devices that had received FDA approval. But arguing a bill is unnecessary or unwise does not get at the question we are examining: Whether the bill does what Kraig said it does in terms of immunity. Our conclusion  Kraig said a bill proposed by a Wisconsin lawmaker """"grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products."""" He acknowledged that his statement was """"over broad,"""" in that immunity applies only when FDA approval has been granted. The bill doesn’t give blanket protection to drug and device makers. But its primary intent is to give them immunity, with some exceptions. We rate Kraig’s statement .""",0
"The decision could undermine President Donald Trump’s support among farmers, an important constituency in the November 2020 election. Some U.S. farmers have already been hurt by the United States’ prolonged trade war with China. “The Administration is moving forward to finalize the 2020 RVO (Renewable Volume Obligations) in line with the agreement that the President made this fall,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said. Deere confirmed he was talking about a proposal unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency in October, which was intended to compensate the biofuel industry for the administration’s expanded use of refinery waivers, but which the industry has largely panned as insufficient. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners are required to blend some 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol into their gasoline every year, but small facilities can be exempted if compliance would hurt them financially. The Trump administration’s EPA has roughly quadrupled the number of the so-called Small Refinery Exemptions, something corn farmers and biofuel producers say has deeply undercut demand for ethanol. The oil industry says the waivers are needed to preserve blue-collar refining jobs and disagrees with the claim that the waivers destroy demand. The EPA plan, devised after weeks of negotiations with both the oil and biofuel industries to resolve the issue, would raise the biofuels volumes that some refineries must blend in 2020 based on U.S. Energy Department recommendations for volumes that should be exempted. Biofuel interests wanted the regulation to be based on volumes that have actually been waived, since the EPA has routinely waived more blending volumes than the DOE has recommended. On Tuesday, more than 1,700 farmers and biofuel advocates sent a letter to Trump, criticizing EPA’s proposal and asking him to directly intervene in the debate. By then, the decision had already been reached. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told the Iowa Corn Growers Association during a meeting in Washington on Tuesday that the administration was sticking with the EPA’s proposal, two sources familiar with the matter said. The plan is expected to be finalized by Friday, one source said. The final rule for 2020 blending requirements is already past its end-November deadline. “EPA has reviewed all comments received during the comment period from the public and we plan to finalize the rule this winter,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said. Support across key Midwestern states helped propel Trump to the presidency in 2016, a trend he is hoping to replicate in next year’s election. But some farmers have threatened to withdraw support because of his administration’s handling of biofuel policy. The biofuels news, however, comes amid progress in the United States’ trade war with China, a dispute that has been especially damaging to U.S. farmers. It also comes as Congress readies a vote on the nation’s new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, an agreement also expected to boost farmers’ fortunes. Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2019 traded at 12.75 cents each on Wednesday, down from 13.25 cents in the previous session, traders said.",1
"""The story makes no mention of how much all of this equipment costs, or how much it adds to the price of medical treatment. This is a serious–and baffling–omission. The gee-whizness of the story almost immediately begs the question of how much all of this stuff costs. Not a word is mentioned. The established daVinci models cost about $1.5 million. The price of the new Si HD has not been published yet. It is certainly higher than $1.5 million. Analyses have been done that suggest that because surgeries done with daVincis generally produce fewer complications and shorter hospital stays, the devices actually result in lower total costs. This may be true. But again, the story should have mentioned costs. The story does not attempt to quantify the benefits of any of the procedures discussed. Yet it allows interested sources to claim the benefits of better outcomes and fewer side effects. The piece is silent on the potential harms of robot-assisted surgery, which include misapplication [as hospitals that have invested in it seek to use it as much as possible] and exposure to inexperienced users [because this surgery has a learning curve of a reported 18 procedures]. The piece discusses the advantages of belly-button laparopscopic surgery but does not discuss any risks. Being the 9th person in the world to undergo a procedure is not necessarily a good thing. The story presents no evidence that the techniques and technologies profiled are safe or effective. The anecdote at the beginning highlights a prostate cancer patient, who emotionally discusses his desire to live for his family and friends. Yet his case says nothing about the type of surgery he had, trans-navel, and whether that might improve his prognosis. There is no evidence it will. This is therefore a clear case of disease-mongering–using an irrelevant anecdote for nothing more than generating emotions to make the technology seem necessary. The piece at various points says the robot-assisted procedures reduce pain and recovery time and allow previously inaccessible levels of control over minute movements. The segment vividly demonstrates how the device can be used to thread a needle and peel a grape. This all appears to oversell the benefits, another form of disease-mongering. And the host at one point suggests the robotic surgery tools could """"make human hands a quaint artifact of the past""""–a statement that makes accuracy and plausibility look like quaint artifacts too. Sources include: While it does not appear Michael Stifelman of NYU has a standard, disclosable financial conflict of interest regarding the daVinci’s maker, he clearly is an interested party as someone who has devoted his career to use of robotics in surgery. He leads a center that has invested heavily in the technology, needs to generate a lot of patient cases to pay for it, and has ambitions to play the role of leader in the field. There is nothing like balance or context in sourcing here. The segment refers to laparoscopic surgery not done through the navel, and surgery not assisted by a robot, only to assert their inferiority. Several technologies are mentioned in this segment. Navel surgery is presented as cutting-edge–the patient is said to have """"ma[d]e medical history"""" as the ninth to have his prostate removed via his navel. Yet the piece says surgeons are also using the technique to perform a variety of surgeries, including hysterectomies and removal of lymph nodes. In either case, the piece doesn’t say where navel surgeries are being done. The story reports that 930 daVinci surgical robots are in use around the country, but that’s a census of mostly the old da Vinci machines, not the featured daVinci Si HD Surgical Systems, with the newer, finer controls and optics. This machine was introduced in April. It is not clear where these newer models are in use. It is reported that voice-activated robot assistants are being developed at Georgia Tech and Emory University, and it’s clear on the video that the devices are not yet on the market. The new generation of daVinci surgery robots was just introduced in April, so it’s safe to call that novel. Surgery through the navel is not widely practiced yet, and the piece is reasonably clear on this. It would have been useful to explain that laparoscopic surgery–through the navel or not, or with a robot or not–is standard practice for many types of surgery. The life-assistant robots mentioned briefly at the end are clearly just in development. We can’t be sure what motivated ABC to devote so much airtime to this segment at this time.""",1
"The relevant research finding is so far removed from a clinical diagnostic tool — and the story makes that clear — that it’s tough to expect much from the story in regard to cost. The story discusses benefits here: The paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzhiemer’s disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer’s, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. How much higher was the protein, in numerical terms? And how do they know it’s significant–that the higher level means anything? All lab values have normal ranges–how do they know if these measurements were abnormal? Instead of providing insight on this, the story explains that it’s really too early to tell if any of this means anything valuable. So why report on it now? If a story is going to speculate about the potential clinical benefits of a new research finding (and this one does), the story should also discuss the harms. It’s worth pointing out, for example, that any test such as this would produce false-positive and false-negative results. Such results could cause unnecessary concern and anxiety and perhaps the loss of a lucrative career — or false reassurance that nothing is wrong when a degenerative process is underway. The story discusses the number of people involved in the study, their different conditions, and why each group is relevant. However, the story would have been stronger if it had noted that the samples used in the study were from the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of individuals. That would better explain why researchers don’t know if the relevant protein can be found in the blood. As it is, the story tells readers that higher levels of CCL11 were found — but not where. The story also makes it clear that there’s a lot more work that needs to be done. No disease mongering here. The story does incorporate input from one independent source — who raised valuable points about the limitations of this discovery and the amount of work that remains to be done. There do not appear to be any conflicts of interest. The story makes it clear that there is no method for diagnosing this brain disorder in living people, and it mentions that other biomarkers are being tested. However, the information was relayed in a somewhat confusing way. The story notes that a diagnostic approach focusing on CCL11 may only be “one part of a larger process.” It then quotes a researcher from the study as saying: “This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE.” The story then refers to other studies that have attempted to identify other means of diagnosing CTE in living patients. However, it offers little information on those other diagnostic tools. Presumably, they have significant limitations since we are still unable to diagnose CTE in the living. But perhaps other biomarkers have been found, but not yet incorporated into a reliable diagnostic tool. Either way, we wish that had been more clear — as well as the relevance of these previous studies to the CCL11 research. Once readers get past the first couple paragraphs, the story makes clear that this research is far removed from clinical applications. The story quotes one of the researchers involved in the work as saying “This is something new.” What is new is, apparently, the discovery that CCL11 levels are correlated to CTE. Whether other biomarkers have been identified (as discussed above, under “Compare Alternatives”) but not yet incorporated into diagnostic tools is not clear from the story. Because the story uses a word-for-word quote by one of the researchers from the news release — without disclosing the quote came from a news release — the story rates Not Satisfactory on this criterion.",0
"The Deerfield Village Board approved an ordinance banning the possession of assault weapons, including the AR-15, on April 2. After the ordinance goes into effect in June 2018, residents could be fined up to $1,000 per day for possessing a semi-automatic weapon within city limits. The ordinance states “assault weapons have been increasingly used in an alarming number of notorious mass shooting incidents at public schools, public venues, places of worship and places of public accommodation including, but not limited to, the recent mass shooting incidents in Parkland, Florida (Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School; 17 people killed), Sutherland Springs, Texas (First Baptist Church; 26 people), Las Vegas, Nevada (Music Festival, 58 people killed), and Orlando, Florida (Pulse Nightclub, 49 people killed).” The village released an FAQ to summarize the assault weapons ban. Weapons meeting the definition of “assault weapon” under the ordinance are those that are semi-automatic, have the ability to accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition, and have at least one additional feature defined in the ordinance. Police won’t go door-to-door to confiscate assault weapons. Rather, gun owners have been asked to voluntarily surrender the weapons and high-capacity magazines—or to render them inoperable: The Village intends to enforce this ordinance in a manner consistent with other local ordinances. This ordinance will initially be enforced primarily through education and voluntary compliance. A police officer may issue a citation for a violation of this ordinance in the manner provided by law. Weapons being illegally possessed will be confiscated as authorized by the ordinance. Any other enforcement of this ordinance, including search or seizure to effect this ordinance, must comply with the requirements of State and Federal law. Members of the Department will not go “door to door” to ensure compliance. Violators of the assault weapons ban could face a $250 to $1,000 fine for each day that they’re in violation of the ordinance. The National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action announced that it would support a legal challenge brought against the group Guns Save Life. The result of the legal challenge remains to be seen, but the ordinance is based on a similar ban approved in nearby Highland Park. That ban was upheld by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2015 — and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Chicago also has an assault weapons ban on the books. Comments",0
"There is no discussion of cost – not of the new troponin I test nor of any existing test. Explaining sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value is admittedly a task in and of itself. But the difficulty in explaining the concepts and applying them to the results of a study does not exempt a story from trying. The story only referred to the new test being “more predictive than other biomarkers” or “more sensitive than the existing one.” But even those relative references weren’t quantified. No sense of the scale of improvement of was provided. That’s not helpful. Since the sensitivity and specificity of the new test was not quantified, the story provided only a glowing report of progress – of benefit. There was no discussion of potential harms. Most physicians and most organizations would frown on making a diagnosis of a heart attack based simply on a blood test. Up To Date, an authoritative resource suggests that patients with a suspicion of having a heart attack have an electrocardiogram, undergo a brief medical history, have a physical examination and have blood drawn for biologic markers. The story suggests that this new blood test can be used alone to make the diagnosis or rule it out. Exaggerating the benefits of a test without placing it into the context provides the readers with a false impression of the test and its utility. Making decisions on the basis of a single blood test could lead to patient harm. There was no critical analysis of the quality of the evidence. The story didn’t even include the following limitations provided by the researchers in the journal article: Our study had several limitations. First, the final diagnosis of acute MI was based substantially on in-house troponin measurements, which might bias the biomarker evaluation toward troponin assays. Because both the index test and reference standard included a change in troponin levels over time, there is the potential for a type of incorporation bias, which may overestimate the measure of diagnostic accuracy of serial hsTnI levels. However, hsTnI appeared to facilitate identification of patients with non–ST-elevation ACS, a diagnosis independent of troponin values. Second, the number of patients with availability of biomarker values differed, which potentially could affect the results. Third, the proportion of patients with MI was rather high compared with that of other studies involving consecutive patients with chest pain, but the number is in line with different European cohorts.Still, this and the fact that only white European patients were enrolled might limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. There was no disease mongering. The story mentioned that the study was funded by two pharma companies but it did not include any of the individual disclosures included in the journal article itself. And, in terms of sourcing, while the story did include quotes from two independent physicians, neither of them directly addressed the quality of the evidence. One said “we can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test” but it wasn’t clear if she had used the test or if she was commenting on the data reported. So we don’t know why she was used as a source. The other spoke in only very general terms about the ultimate goal of such research and about the need for such a blood test – but nothing about the evidence itself. The only comparisons are very broad and lack substantiation with actual data. The study compared the existing test for troponin l and a more specific test and examined the data using different break points and time. Here’s the authors conclusions, “Among patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, hsTnl (the new test) or cTnl (the existing test) determination 3 hours after admission may facilitate early rule out of MI (heart attack). A serial change in hsTnl or cTnl levels form admission (using the 99th percentile cut off value) to 3 hours after admission may facilitate early diagnosis of AMI.”  The story conclusions don’t seem to match those of the authors. The availability of the new test is left as a mystery by this story. Is it experimental? Is it growing in use already? Is it in widespread use? We’re not told a thing about its availability or use. We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this one for trying to establish the relative novelty of this troponin I test but how it is novel or superior – as already outlined – is not adequately addressed. There’s no evidence that the story relied solely or largely on a news release.",1
"The study, published this week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, reached its conclusion after examining 20 years of published research on the issue. The authors say the medical finding have been largely overlooked and overshadowed by concerns that parents should have the right to determine how their children are disciplined. While spanking is certainly not as widespread as it was 20 years ago, many still cling to the practice and see prohibiting spanking as limiting the rights of parents. That point of view highlights the difficulty in changing hearts and minds on the issue, despite a mountain of accumulated evidence showing the damage physical punishment can have on a child, says Joan Durant, a professor at University of Manitoba and one of the authors of the study. “We’re really past the point of calling this a controversy. That’s a word that’s used and I don’t know why, because in the research there really is no controversy,” she said in an interview. “If we had this level of consistency in findings in any other area of health, we would be acting on it. We’d be pulling out all the stops to work on the issue.”   Durant and co-author Ron Ensom, with the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, cite research showing that physical punishment makes children more aggressive and antisocial, and can cause cognitive impairment and developmental difficulties. Recent studies suggest it may reduce the brain’s grey matter in areas relevant to intelligence testing. “What people have realized is that physical punishment doesn’t only predict aggression consistently, it also predicts internalizing kinds of difficulties, like depression and substance use,” said Durant. “There are no studies that show any long term positive outcomes from physical punishment.”   While banned in 32 countries, corporal punishment of children retains at least partial social acceptance in much of the world. Debates on the issue typically revolve around the ethics of using violence to enforce discipline. With the study, Durant hopes parents will start to look at the issue from a medical perspective. “What we’re hoping is that physicians will take that message and do more to counsel parents around this and to help them understand that physical punishment isn’t getting them where they want to go,” she said. She also hopes that countries that allow the practice - including Canada - will take another look at their child protection laws. Canada is one of more than 190 countries to have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a 1989 treaty that sets out protections for children. The treaty - which has been ratified by all UN member states except for the United States, Somalia and South Sudan - includes a passage stating that countries must protect children from “all forms of physical or mental violence”. “If we had two or three studies that showed that if you took 500 mg of vitamin C a day you could reduce cancer risk, we would all be taking 500 mg of vitamin C a day,” Durant said. “Here, we have more than 80 studies, I would say more than 100, that show the same thing (about corporal punishment), and yet we keep calling it controversial.”",0
"The rabbits were given a supplement. Is this supplement available and if so, what does it cost? We’re not told. The story provided comparative quantified specifics on the benefits of sulforaphane in the three groups of rabbits, in the form of percentage decrease in lipid levels. We’ll call that good enough for a Satisfactory rating, although ideally we’d like to see some discussion of what the results might mean for cardiovascular risk in a human. We’ll address that deficiency below under the Evidence criterion. At first glance, it’s hard to imagine there are any dangers: Chemicals in broccoli are harmless, right? But as revealed by this very study–that sulforaphane has the capacity to significantly change blood lab levels–these chemicals can work like medication. That means they also may carry harms, too. In this case, specifically, it’s for people taking the blood thinner Coumadin (warfarin), who must be very careful when eating broccoli and other vegetables rich in Vitamin K. The story does a good job of describing the experiment, which was conducted on 15 rabbits, and it also offers a helpful link to the research article itself. But it makes little effort to help the reader leap the chasm between rabbits and human beings–a problem exacerbated by the headline, which invites application of the results of this small, basic study to people. The only cautionary note in the story occurs at the very end, when the author inserts a “caveat” warning readers that clinical studies in people have not yet been undertaken. It would have been more useful to warn that these findings might not have any application to humans at all. And although this appears to be a randomized clinical trial, the story doesn’t explain if there was blinding of the researchers who were examining the rabbits’ blood vessels. This is important because a lack of blinding could affect the results of observations. See a more detailed explanation for why this and other study details matter. Given the ubiquity of heart disease in the American populace, anything that reduces atherosclerosis should be of keen interest. The danger with this piece is the hyping of early animal research, implying the findings are for readers to act upon now. This story included no quotes from the researchers or outside sources–both could have provided important context and caveats about this kind of early-stage animal research, and the emerging results of this chemical, which also made recent headlines in cancer research, making us curious about why this study, now. As for conflicts of interest, the article didn’t mention any, and because the study coauthors declare none, we will assume that to be the case. There is no discussion of alternate strategies for minimizing either the accumulation of arterial plaques specifically or heart disease generally. The article offers no information on availability of the supplement, nor does it reflect on the type of intervention that might make sense to people (i.e., eat lots of cruciferous veggies, take sulforaphane supplements). The basic nature of the research likely makes all of that premature, but that then raises the question of why a media outlet would publicize research at such an early stage. And this is an important question to ask, because it’s not hard to envision that based on this story alone, companies that make supplements (which are held to a much lower standard of efficacy compared to medication classified as drugs) could start marketing this supplement, and use this single study and news story to back up its usefulness. The text asserts that this study of sulforaphane’s effects on atherosclerosis is the first to examine that link. We could not locate a news release related to this research article, although it seems implausible that WSJ reporters are scouring obscure research journals such as this one for story ideas. But while we have no evidence that the story relied excessively on any news release, we’re hesitant to give credit because there’s no evidence of original reporting. We’ll rate this Not Applicable.",1
"""Emphasizing the need to bring clean fuel to the world’s poor, James Rockall, CEO of the World LPG Association, recently said that """"more (people) die of indoor air pollution than malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined."""" Rockall’s statement showed up in a tweet from Stanford Energy, a research group at Stanford University, after he spoke there May 9. Rockall confirmed that he did make this claim, and we decided to check it out. Public health researchers have known for some time that in many poorer nations, fumes from dirty cooking stoves pose a health threat. Rockall’s group represents the interests of the liquified petroleum gas industry, but that self-interest aside, there’s no question that gas burns more cleanly than wood or coal. Rockall told us he got his numbers from the World Health Organization. He took a 2016 report on deaths from indoor air pollution and compared that to 2015 estimates of death from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The indoor air pollution deaths, however, were based on 2012 data. To keep the comparison fair, we looked at 2012 mortality estimates for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We consulted three different sources -- UNAIDS, WHO and the Global Burden of Disease Study -- and used the highest available estimate. Here’s what the numbers show:  Deaths in 2012 HIV/AIDS 1.6 million Malaria 0.8 million TB 1.3  million Total 3.7  million Indoor air pollution total 4.2  million As you can see, the total mortality from the three diseases comes to 3.7 million in 2012, less than the 4.2 million people estimated to have died from diseases attributable to indoor air pollution. Rockall used different underlying estimates to reach a total of 2.9 million deaths due to the three diseases. Our total is higher, but we found no estimates from any source that undercut his basic point. Deaths from indoor air pollution are higher than the sum of deaths from the world’s major leading infectious diseases. Counting deaths from indoor air pollution is more complicated than tracking deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Mark Wilson, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said it is easier to identify someone who has HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. """"Much more difficult is defining how one dies from indoor air pollution because it will never be the sole immediate cause of death,"""" Wilson said. """"Rather, a variety of physiological, immunological and toxicological processes would compromise someone’s health, such that the cause might be defined as some sort of respiratory insufficiency, asthma, heart disease, etcetera."""" The WHO study made various assumptions to link diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease to indoor air pollution. Rockall said more people die of indoor air pollution than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. We compared 2012 estimates of indoor air pollution deaths to a range of estimates for the three infectious diseases for 2012 and later. No matter how we did it, the deaths due to indoor air pollution trumped those due to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. But an epidemiologist offered the caveat that the indoor air pollution study relied on assumptions that introduce a greater chance of uncertainty than counts of deaths from the leading infectious diseases. For that reason.""",0
"In July 2018, pop singer Demi Lovato made headlines when she was hospitalized after an overdose. Although she was reportedly recovering well afterwards, one website soon rehashed the news coverage of her overdose and prefaced their write-up with a couple of paragraphs claiming Lovato had passed away:  American pop star and actress Demi Lovato who was rushed to hospital in Los Angeles after a reported heroin overdose has died, spokesman said in a statement. Lovato died at the age of 25 while on admission at the hospital but the statement did not mention the cause of her death. The report of Lovato’s death was false and originated solely with a website called “New York Timely Reports” (whose domain name, nytiwes.com imitates that of the legitimate New York Times). “New York Timely Reports” is a junk news site which has published other celebrity death hoaxes, such as falsely reporting that former president George H.W.

"More than 100 fires are ablaze in New South Wales and Victoria states, many of which have been burning for several weeks and including a single blaze that stretches more than 60 km (37.2 miles) in a national park north of Sydney. Conditions are expected to worsen from Tuesday, when temperatures are forecast to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and winds are expected to start picking up. “We are expecting to see across large geographic areas high fire dangers,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. “Firefighters are doing kilometers and kilometers of back burning operations, containment line establishment and consolidation.”  Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November. Bushfires are common in Australia’s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry. Stoked by strong winds, several fires have combined into a single massive blaze that is threatening the region of Hawkesbury, about 50 km north west of Sydney. Authorities have warned the blaze is unlikely to be extinguished until meaningful rain arrives - which is not expected for at least three months - and forecasts indicate the fire could be pushed towards larger population areas. “The big danger is if the winds come from the west and that’s exactly what is forecast,” Hawkesbury City Mayor Barry Calvert told Reuters. “People are trying to clear their gutters, clean up the leaves on the ground, anything they can do to keep their properties safe.”  Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses. “We’ve opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can’t move them quickly,” Calvert told Reuters. The wildfires have blanketed Sydney - home to more than 5 million people - in smoke and ash for more than two weeks, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks. The city, usually known for its sea breezes, clear skies and beach-dotted coastline, has made several appearances in the top ten lists of the most polluted cities in the world. Severe water restrictions begin in the harbor city on Tuesday. Australia’s worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria state in February 2009, killing 173 people and injuring 414.",1
"Farm-raised, fresh-water Paiche have journeyed from the murky Amazon to restaurants in cities from Houston to Paris. The low-fat, mercury-free white fish may soon be available at select U.S. grocery stores. Paiche, which at up to 220 pounds (100 kgs)is one of the world’s largest fish, fed spear-fishing indigenous peoples for centuries. But their numbers dwindled when nets were introduced in the Amazon and the region’s cities grew and developed. Amazone, a company backed by Peruvian mining and cement conglomerate the Hochschild Group, hopes to save the species from extinction by breeding organic, farm-raised fish for export and releasing some back into the wild. “What really got me most interested was the effort to try to control the commercial fishing of an endangered species,” said Jose Duarte, chef at the Italian Peruvian restaurant Taranta in Boston, Mass. “It’s a really good fish ... it’s almost like a sea bass with a better texture,” said Duarte, who was preparing a daily special of pan-seared Paiche with panca peppers and scalloped potatoes. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has listed Chilean sea bass, also known as Patagonian toothfish, as a fish to avoid because of unsustainable fishing practices and potentially high levels of mercury. Amazone is not yet profitable. It expects to export $3 million worth of frozen Paiche this year, up from $500,000 sold in 2011, when the fish first hit global markets. Paiche, a carnivorous, air-breathing giant also known as Arapaima, can be cut into generous, bone-free fillets. Chefs say it is easy to sear and very difficult to burn due to its high collagen levels. Restaurants such as Robert at the Museum of Art and Design in New York, Area 31 in Miami and Latin Bites in Houston now serve Amazone’s Paiche. It is also sold in Spain, France and Italy. “The idea is to have a supply for global gourmet markets,” said Isaac Gherson, CEO of Amazone. “We don’t want Paiche to become a type of commodity — that would mean exploiting the gain.”   Paiche is also earning a place in Lima, an emerging culinary capital, where celebrity chef Pedro Miguel Schiaffino grills Paiche steaks and marinates the fish with lime to make ceviche, a Peruvian staple, at his upscale Malabar restaurant. Amazone sells the fish in the United States through ArtisanFish, a Florida-based wholesaler that markets hormone-free, premium seafood with the goal of protecting the environment. “We have a strong presence in New York, Philadelphia and Washington and we are expanding very soon into the Midwest,” said founder Adrian Burstein. ArtisanFish has negotiated an agreement to sell Paiche in a U.S. retail chain, but Burstein declined to name the retailer due to contract provisions. “It was hard to replace Chilean sea bass with an alternative that has similar qualities but is truly sustainable,” said Burstein. “Now you have an option — Paiche is that option.”",0
"In March 2017, anti-vaccination blogs presented misleading reports concerning a pair of rejected motions that month by the Swedish parliament, also known as the Riksdagen. Frequent purveyors of conspiracy theories and fake news such as YourNewsWire.com reported variations of the following: The Swedish Riksdagen (parliament) rejected seven motions on May 10 that would have enshrined forced vaccinations into law, stating “It would violate our [Swedish Constitution] if we introduced compulsory vaccinations, or mandatory vaccinations.” Noting also the “massive resistance (by Swedes) to all forms of coercion with regard to vaccinations“, the Riksdag also made reference to “frequent serious adverse reactions” in children who receive vaccinations. A spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the Folkhalsomyndigheten, told us via email on 30 March 2018 that only two — not seven — motions proposing a mandatory vaccination program were rejected in 2017. They added that the proposals were not rejected because vaccinations would be “harmful,” but because “all health care in Sweden, including vaccination programs, is voluntary.” Conspiracy theory blogs also reported that the Riksdagen “banned” mandatory vaccinations. What it did not mention is that the country’s voluntary vaccination program, which covers ten diseases, already dates back decades. While Sweden’s program is voluntary, the vast majority of children are still vaccinated; the Folkhalsomyndigheten spokesperson told us, “More than 97 percent of the 2 year olds have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, for example.” Overall, however, the country experienced an increase in measles cases in 2017. The European Centers for Disease Control reported that Sweden was one of 18 nations where the number of cases reported during the first half of 2017 exceeded that of the same period a year earlier. YourNewsWire.com and similar blogs sourced their stories from a report from an “alternative health” group, the National Health Federation. However, this group has come under its share of scrutiny and criticism. For example, the American Cancer Society excoriated the group in a report concerning “unproven methods” of managing the disease, saying: After study of the literature and other available information, the American Cancer Society has found no evidence that methods of treatment promoted by the National Health Federation (NHF) result in objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings. Lacking such evidence, the American Cancer Society strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment based on the recommendations of the NHF.",1
"On 25 July 2017, the far-right news and opinion web site Freedom Daily posted an article purporting to give an account of a violent Somali Muslim “takeover” of the small town of Shelbyville, Tennessee. Despite its surface resemblance to a news report, however, the post (dubiously bylined “Prissy Holly”) was an ill-informed, opinion-laden attack on the Muslim refugee population of, well … everywhere. It begins: Muslims continue to prove they have little intentions of integrating into modern civilization after fleeing their war-torn countries, as they continue to force Islam and Sharia Law onto unassuming Americans. Cities across America where migrants have been allowed to invade are rapidly transforming into Sharia swamps, just take a look at the startling transformation of cities like Dearborn and Minneapolis. As many Americans were left in shock and horror following the Minnesota woman being violently shot down by a Somali Muslim cop, now Somali migrants have set their sights on another American city to invade. Desperate Tennessee residents are frantically crying out for help, as the small town they once loved and cherished is being completely overrun by hordes of nasty Muslim migrants, who have now started targeting local Christians with violent Islamic crimes. The text becomes more specific as it continues: While it would be wise to keep these terrorists confined to Somalia as much as possible, liberals keep advocating to bring Somali Muslims to America by the thousands, where hordes of Somalis are dumped into American cities annually much to the horror of Americans across the country. And unfortunately for the residents of Shelbyville, Tennessee, a small American town about an hour’s drive from Nashville, they’re now becoming intimately acquainted with exactly what Sharia Law and Islam teaches, after third world migrants were dropped into their town overnight. From reading those paragraphs, one might easily come away with the impression that Shelbyville experienced some massive influx of Somali refugees in recent weeks or months, but that is not the case. Over the past fifteen years, the U.S. has resettled 51 refugees there, of whom 47 were Somali, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center, which tracks refugee resettlement in the United States. The largest number of refugees to resettle in the town in a single year was 11. With a population of around 20,000, these arrivals represent less than one percent of Shelbyville’s total population. Official resettlement isn’t the only way refugees arrive in U.S. communities, however. In the case of Shelbyville, already-resettled refugees began moving there in the early 2000s in order to take advantage of job openings in the local meatpacking industry. Exact counts are hard to come by, although, according to a 2010 U.S. Census estimate, Shelbyville had 446 foreign-born residents originating from sub-Saharan Africa as of that year, amounting to 2.3 percent of the total population. In a small town, that could cause a noticeable cultural shift. But it’s hardly a “takeover.” In point of fact, we learned from Shelbyville Police Chief Jan Phillips that the Somali refugee population of the town has dramatically decreased since that time. A 2015 Census Bureau estimate put the total number of residents of Subsaharan African origin at 166 (less than 1 percent of the population). Needless to say, Phillips dismissed the notion that they had “taken over” Shelbyville as “completely false”. A later paragraph in the Freedom Daily post describes the “culture clash” supposedly happening in the town (emphasis in the original): “They’ve had an impact here. Unfortunately, it’s not been a good impact,” said Brian Mosely, a reporter for the local Shelbyville Times-Gazette stated. “I found that there was just an enormous culture clash going on here,” he said. “The Somalis were, according to a lot of the people I talked to here, were being very, very rude, inconsiderate, very demanding. They would go into stores and haggle over prices. They would also demand to see a male salesperson, would not deal with women in stores. Their culture is totally alien to anything the residents are used to,” Mosely added. But although these remarks by former Shelbyville Times-Gazette reporter Brian Mosely are accurately quoted, they weren’t uttered this year, or last year, or even five years ago. They date from 2009, when Mosely, who had written extensively about the arrival of Somali refugees in Shelbyville during the mid-2000s, was interviewed by the Christian Broadcasting Network. What of the “Muslim migrants” who Freedom Daily says are “targeting local Christians with violent Islamic crimes”? Here’s the one and only example of such a crime they were able to cite (emphasis, again, in the original): But unfortunately for locals, a “culture clash” would soon be the least of their concerns after a series of violent crimes were taken out at the hands of these Somali migrants. Several months ago, the liberal media completely white-washed a series of events where three churches were shot up by Muslims. Jihad Watch was the only one to even report on the story, where AK47’s were used to shatter the windows of multiple churches in the area. They reported: “A Muslim shoots up three churches and nothing is said about his motive or his Islamic identity. Would the same courtesy be shown a Christian who shot up three mosques? Why the coverup? Who is responsible for it? Three churches were shot up in the Shelbyville, TN area starting on the night of Sep 27, 2016. The Horse Mountain Church of Christ was shot 16 more times the night of Sep 29. The Philippi United Methodist Church along with another church was also struck by 7.62 x 39 rounds on the 29th. (7.62 x 39 rounds are consistent with an AK47 or a SKS rifle) The Bedford County Agriculture Center was also attacked with gunfire on the 29th, shattering the front glass. There were also reports of utility boxes being shot during this time.” Although it is based on an actual incident, the Freedom Daily account is a bald-faced misrepresentation of the facts. Contrary to what is claimed, the 2016 Shelbyville church shootings did receive a fair amount of press coverage, in which it was, in fact, routinely reported that the sole suspect, Wendell Tobias Buchanan, was a “recent convert to Islam,” according to his family. What Wendell Tobias Buchanan was not, however, was a Somali refugee. No Somalis were involved or implicated in those attacks in any way. Freedom Daily’s attempt to portray Shelbyville, Tennessee as a community torn asunder by violent foreign jihadists does not hold up to even the most basic scrutiny, trading instead on appeals to emotion and based on false reporting. Even the photographs in the article are fake, Chief Phillips told us. He is correct. An image supposedly showing downtown Shelbyville actually depicts the small town of Bell Buckle, 10 miles away. An uncaptioned photograph showing the police response to a public disturbance was actually taken in the aftermath of the 2015 Dylan Roof church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.",1
"""Crossroads GPS, a deep-pocketed conservative advocacy group that has been running issue advertisements in a variety of key 2010 Congressional contests, recently produced an ad attacking Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., who's running for a Senate seat against former GOP Rep. Pat Toomey. The ad's narration begins, """"Over half a million Pennsylvanians unemployed, and what's Congressman Joe Sestak done? He voted to gut Medicare, slashing benefits for Pennsylvania seniors. The Obama-Sestak scheme could jeopardize access to care for millions."""" In the visuals, the ad says, """"Reducing benefits for 854,489 seniors,"""" a statistic it attributes to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan group that studies health care policy. The ad also says on screen that Sestak """"voted to cut Medicare by $500 billion,"""" citing his vote in favor of the Democratic health care bill that was signed into law earlier this year by President Barack Obama. Focusing on seniors makes sense in Pennsylvania: It's the fourth oldest state in the union, with 15.5 percent of its residents over 65, trailing only Florida, West Virginia and Maine. So we thought we'd check to see whether the ad's claims about Medicare cuts were accurate. Initially, we were puzzled by the reference to """"854,489 seniors,"""" since it seemed like a remarkably specific number. When we contacted Crossroads GPS, a spokesman pointed us to a Kaiser Family Foundation database on Medicare Advantage, which is an option within Medicare -- the federal health care plan for Americans over 65 -- provided by private insurers. The Kaiser table shows that Crossroads GPS correctly cited the number of Pennsylvania seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage. That number accounts for nearly 39 percent of all Medicare enrollees in the Keystone State, which is higher than the national average of 25 percent. Because the ad focuses on Medicare Advantage, we'll begin with that facet of the new law. As we stated in a recent fact-check of a different ad, the Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more private sector efficiency to the Medicare program. But the program's higher costs made it a prime target for architects of the new health care law. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found that, on average, Medicare Advantage programs cost taxpayers 14 percent more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law phased out the extra payments Medicare Advantage programs were due to receive over the next three to six years, with the goal of bringing their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The changes were designed to save a projected $136 billion. Would these changes translate into """"reducing benefits"""" for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, as the Crossroads GPS ad says? The cuts do put in jeopardy some of the more generous benefits that Medicare Advantage plans currently offer, such as dental and vision coverage, enhanced prescription drug coverage, coverage for the beneficiary's Medicare premiums and gym memberships. (The specific benefits differ by plan; indeed, variations in benefit packages are a major way that providers compete with each other for seniors.) """"Many insurers are expected to stop participating in the program, while others will increase the premiums they charge seniors,"""" said Michael Tanner, a health care specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute. On the other hand, the new law makes clear that Medicare Advantage providers cannot cut basic Medicare benefits -- just extra benefits that are not available to people getting traditional Medicare. This doesn't make the cuts any less real, but the ad, by not mentioning this context, might give viewers a skewed impression of the law's provisions. In addition, other parts of the new law expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- the federal office that oversees Medicare -- announced last week that, on average, Medicare Advantage premiums will drop by 1 percent between 2010 and 2011. All of this suggests that there will probably be benefit cuts to Medicare Advantage programs but not to the core program. And the exact shape of these changes is not known yet. """"It is not yet clear how plans will respond to payment reductions enacted in the health reform law, nor what these changes will mean for beneficiaries nationwide or in any given state,"""" said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. So looking back at the ad's claims, do the Medicare Advantage changes """"gut Medicare"""" or """"jeopardize access to care for millions""""? We think """"gut"""" is an overheated way of putting it. There will likely be cuts to Medicare Advantage, but to suggest that these will eviscerate the program seems exaggerated, since basic benefits must be preserved. What about the possibility that the changes could """"jeopardize access to care for millions""""? Setting aside the fact that there are not """"millions"""" of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Pennsylvania, we'll acknowledge that there's a risk that some Medicare Advantage providers will look at their financial balance sheets and decide to pull out of the market. But Neuman said that Medicare beneficiaries have an average of 30 plans available to them in 2010 -- and if they can't find one they like, they can always sign up for regular Medicare. That doesn't seem to us like a situation in which access will be jeopardized. What if you assume that the ad was referring to Medicare as a whole (not just to Medicare Advantage) when it talked about gutting Medicare and jeopardizing access to care? Answering this question brings up the $500 billion cut referenced in the ad. The new law would indeed slow the rate of growth of the broader Medicare program by roughly that amount over 10 years. But it's not a slam-dunk that this represents a cut. The new law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it would slow the program's future growth over 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- in fact, the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' non-partisan arbiter on such matters, projects that Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. Such reductions could certainly squeeze future benefits, especially when inflation in the health care sector is taken into account. But once again, we feel that the use of the word """"gut"""" and the notion that beneficiaries will find their access to care jeopardized amounts to an exaggeration. The changes in the new law """"are not going to cause any hospital, and few other providers, to drop Medicare patients -- they couldn’t survive without them,"""" said Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. So let's recap. The ad is on fairly safe ground in suggesting that Pennsylvania's 854,489 seniors on Medicare Advantage will see a decline in benefits, but it ignores the fact that no basic benefits will be cut. Meanwhile, the ad uses what we consider overheated language. The changes set in motion by the new law don't strike us, or several experts we spoke to, as ones that will """"gut"""" the program or """"jeopardize access to care for millions.""""""",1
"ClientEarth has taken action against the government before, which resulted in a Supreme Court judgment last year ordering it to submit new air quality plans to the European Commission. But ClientEarth says those plans do not go far enough to tackle nitrogen dioxide emissions and has lodged papers at the High Court to seek an order to quash them and order new ones. “Our plans clearly set out how we will improve the UK’s air quality through a new program of Clean Air Zones, which alongside national action and continued investment in clean technologies will create cleaner, healthier air for all,” a Department for Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said in response. Last year the European Commission also began 21 infringement proceedings against EU member nations in breach of existing rules and has proposed more stringent legislation in the face of resistance from some governments. Nitrogen oxides reduce air quality and member states have been flouting EU limits on a range of pollutants associated with more than 400,000 premature deaths per year, according to European Commission data. Under the EU’s Air Quality Directive, member states were supposed to comply with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits in 2010, but could have extended that to 2015 if they delivered plans to deal with high levels of the gas, which is produced mainly by diesel engines and causes respiratory illnesses. UK government data last year showed only five out of a total 43 pollution zones in Britain would comply by the end of 2015, 15 zones by 2020, 38 by 2025 and 40 by 2030. The remaining three zones - Greater London, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire urban areas would not even comply by 2030, the data showed. Under plans submitted to the European Commission in December, “Clean Air Zones” would be introduced in areas of Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton where pollution is most serious by 2020. Vehicles such as old buses, taxis, coaches and lorries have to pay a charge to enter these zones but private passenger cars would not be charged. “The government’s plans were an insult to those being made sick and dying from air pollution and failed to consider strong measures to get the worst polluting diesel vehicles out of our town and city centers,” said ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews.",0
"On 12 January 2017, the United States Senate voted 51 to 48 to approve a budget resolution for the upcoming year. At the time of its passage, many news outlets reported that the Senate was “one step closer” to repealing the Affordable Care Act: The Senate took a crucial step to pave the way toward repealing Obamacare early Thursday morning, passing a budget resolution that would let Republicans’ eventual repeal bill move through the chamber with just 51 votes. The measure passed 51-48, with every Senate Democrat present opposing it, and every Senate Republican except Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) supporting it. If the House of Representatives passes the same measure — and they plan to do so later this week — it will go into effect, and make sure that Obamacare repeal cannot be filibustered by Senate Democrats. Shortly after this budget was approved, a viral message started circulating on Facebook which claimed that the Senate had voted to immediately repeal several individual provisions afforded by the ACA:  In Case You Missed It The Senate voted 51 to 48: 1. To end coverage for preexisting conditions, veterans benefits, and aid to rural hospitals. 2. To remove discrimination protection for women in healthcare. 3. Against the provision allowing children to remain on their parent’s insurance till the age of 26. 4. To cut off funding for the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 5. Against ACA contraceptive coverage and maternity care provision. 6. To direct committees to send budget legislation to defund and repeal the Affordable Care Act. For those who get health insurance through work, no pre-existing conditions. Lifetime caps for coverage are back for everyone. Real actions are being taken that will affect more than just the 20-30 million people who will lose their health care coverage and the 3 million people who will lose their jobs. Despite their assertions of this being an action to “repeal and replace,” no viable alternative plan has been proposed. The House votes Friday. As of this moment, no replacement exists. Apparently, Speaker Ryan has had his phones cut off because of the volume of calls, so here is his mailing address: 1233 Longworth HOB Washington, D.C. 20515 Fax: (202) 225-3393 The message continued to be shared on social media for weeks, making the warning that the “House votes Friday” outdated. On 13 January 2017, the House voted 227 to 198 to approve the budget blueprint: The House cleared the way on Friday for speedy action to repeal the Affordable Care Act, putting Congress on track to undo the most significant health care law in a half-century. With a near party-line vote of 227 to 198, the House overcame the opposition of Democrats and the anxieties of some Republicans to approve a budget blueprint that allows Republicans to end major provisions of President Obama’s health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. The viral Facebook post does list several provisions afforded by the ACA, and the United States government did start passing legislation that could conceivably lead to the repeal of President Barack Obama’s signature health law in early 2017. However, the Senate did not explicitly vote on 12 January 2017 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Another message about a potential repeal also appeared on social media at the same time. While the previous message exaggerated the Senate’s 51-48 vote, the following message attempted to warn people about what could happen if the health care law was repealed:  Friends … just a reminder that even if you are safely covered behind employer-provided insurance, the protections set forth in the ACA (Affordable Care Act), apply to you too. And if those protections are repealed along with the rest (or any part) of the program, you will also be affected. That means you may be trapped in a job, because your pre-existing condition may mean you will not qualify for new insurance offered by another employer, and the cost of private insurance would be prohibitive. If your employer shuts down, lays you off, or even changes insurers, well, you are out of luck. The Senate GOP voted this week that they would not require an eventual ACA replacement to protect against discrimination for pre-existing conditions, which was the standard before the ACA. It means that you (a young adult under the age of 26) or your adult children (over 18) may find yourselves without the protection of insurance, as the Senate GOP voted last night that an eventual ACA replacement will not be required to allow young people to remain on their parents’ insurance up to the age of 26. It means that if you have a high-risk pregnancy, or life-threatening illness such as cancer, you may not be able to afford all the care you need, because you may hit lifetime or annual caps. If you have an infant born with any kind of severe medical condition, or premature, they may hit their lifetime insurance cap before they are old enough to walk. The Senate GOP voted last night that an eventual ACA replacement program would not be required to prohibit lifetime insurance caps. It means that if you are a struggling parent who is uninsured or under-insured, you will no longer be able to count on at least your kids getting the routine medical and dental care they need under the Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP). The Senate GOP voted that CHIP is not required to be protected by an eventual ACA replacement. These provisions of the ACA affect everyone in this country, not just those without insurance through their employers. Much of the focus on repealing the Affordable Care Act has been on the millions of people who will lose their health insurance. However, as noted in the post above, the ACA actually affects many people beyond those who directly purchased insurance through the government marketplace: Much of the recent attention on the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has focused on the fate of the 22.5 million people likely to lose insurance through a repeal of Medicaid expansion and the loss of protections and subsidies in the individual insurance market. Overlooked in the declarations of who stands to lose under plans to “repeal and replace” the ACA are those enrolled in employer-sponsored health plans — the primary source of coverage for people under 65. Job-based plans offered to employees and their families cover 150 million people in the United States. If the ACA is repealed, they stand to lose critical consumer protections that many have come to expect of their employer plan. The ACA also placed limits on out-of-pocket limits, prevented insurance companies from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, and extended coverage to dependents until the age of 26. The Facebook post does list some of the provisions that would potentially be lost with the repeal of the ACA, it does not take into account what will be in the the legislation that is to be written in order to replace it. For instance, President Trump said that he wanted the replacement for the ACA to continue coverage for pre-existing conditions. As Republicans have not yet introduced an official replacement, it is as yet difficult to tell exactly how health insurance in the United States will change as a result, or indeed if it will change at all.",1
"""The story refers to colonoscopies as being “hugely expensive."""" It would have been better to tell readers exactly how much they cost. The story adequately quantifies the mortality benefit from colonoscopy screening. But we wish the story had quantified the benefit in absolute rather than relative terms. The story mentions the risk of perforations, missed cancers and """"unpleasant"""" preparation as the risks/side effects of colonoscopy. The story does a good job of describing the current study as well as placing it in context with other studies. The story does not exaggerate the seriousness or prevalence of colon cancer.

The story should have also mentioned flexible sigmoidoscopy and described the advantages and disadvantages of the different screening methods as well as critically evaulating the idea of doing a fecal occult blood test between colonoscopies (rather than just the """"one MD likes it, one doesn’t"""" approach that was taken). Clearly colonoscopy is available. Clearly colonoscopy is not a new idea. Because the story quotes multiple experts, the reader can assume the story does not rely on a press release as the sole source of information.""",0
"Billy Caldwell, 12, had traveled to Canada with his mother, Charlotte, to get the cannabis oil after Billy’s doctor was ordered to stop prescribing it, but when they flew back into London on Monday customs officials confiscated their supplies. The boy was hospitalized on Friday after suffering several seizures. His case has stirred debate on the therapeutic use of cannabis, with politicians from different parties backing the family and campaigners calling for changes to the law. “This morning, I’ve used an exceptional power as Home Secretary to urgently issue a license to allow Billy Caldwell to be treated with cannabis oil,” the minister, Sajid Javid, said in a statement. “My decision is based on the advice of senior clinicians who have made clear this is a medical emergency.”  Charlotte Caldwell, who says Billy was free of seizures when he was using the cannabis oil, made a statement to reporters outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where her son was being treated. She called for the law to be changed. “No other family should have to go through this sort of ordeal, traveling halfway around the world to get medication which should be freely available to our desperately ill children,” she said. “This is a wake-up call for our country. In the 21st century we need to have a more humane policy, not panic measures. I hope the government reflects upon what happened and what they’ve put our family through these last few days.”  The Home Office had previously said that while it was sympathetic to the child’s plight, it had a duty to stop banned substances from entering Britain. Under British law, cannabis is listed as a schedule 1 drug, meaning that it is not recognized as having a therapeutic value. Schedule 1 drugs can be used for research purposes and clinical trials, but only under a Home Office license. The Caldwell family, who normally live in Northern Ireland, have received support from several members of parliament from different political parties, including Dan Poulter of the ruling Conservative Party. Billy Caldwell had been receiving medicinal cannabis oil on prescription by his family doctor for over a year, but supplies ran out after the Home Office ordered the doctor to stop prescribing it.",0
"This story was more precise on costs than the LA Times, saying, “The devices cost up to $35,000, versus the roughly $25,000 cost of a standard defibrillator. Hospital and doctor fees can raise the total cost over $50,000.” Both stories said, vaguely, that “the cost” of the disease every year is $40 billion. This is confusing to readers for two reasons. One, there is no single payer shelling out $40 billion every year to treat heart failure, and so that number is likely not much more than a very good guess. Two, it leads people to believe that the device, at $50,000 per person, may be a bargain if heart failure right now costs $40 billion to treat. We applaud the Journal for at least raising this issue high in the story. The story cites Eric J. Topol, cardiologist and chief academic officer at Scripps Health, saying, the reduced rate of hospitalizations in the study “may actually present a net reduction in costs from a societal standpoint.” That’s a big what if. As explained above, the story analyzes the benefits in both relative and absolute terms. The story says, “But the study showed an increase in the number of device- or implantation-related complications within 30 days of implant: 118 among 888 patients with the new device, compared to 61 of 898 in the standard defibrillator group.” This is beyond what the LA Times did, and we think it is adequate for this score. The story, in most ways, does a better job than the LA Times in evaluating the quality of the evidence. It mainly accomplishes this by providing more data. For example, it says, “Overall in this study, mild-to-moderate-symptom patients had a 25% relative reduction in death or heart-failure hospitalization with the pacemaker-defibrillators, compared with a standard defibrillator. (This was also a 7.1 percentage point “absolute” reduction in death and hospitalization—33.2% compared with 40.3%. )” By giving readers both the relative reduction and the absolute reduction, the story provides a more complete picture of the findings. The one missing element was something we almost never see in a story that the LA Times provided, which is the number needed to treat (NNT). The Times story says “Fourteen patients had to be treated with the $35,000 device to prevent one death.”  Perhaps this is a smart investment. Providing that NNT figure, though, gives people the right perspective on the findings. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. It did make it sound like heart failure exacerbations happen rapidly, with minor changes in diet. This is not supported by the science. But this is a minor quibble. The story does a good job quoting outside sources, but we wish it had done a better job identifying how many of these folks have conflicts. The story did not adequately explain the comparison between the device and alternatives. For example, research has shown that patients with mild heart-failure can undergo training to take better care of themselves and reduce their number of hospitalizations, too. The story makes it clear that the device studied is in clinical trials for the targeted patient population and that a similar device is on the market. “Just over a month ago, Boston Scientific won federal approval to treat mild-symptom heart-failure patients with such devices. Medtronic is seeking such approval, but already sells it for more severe heart failure patients.” We would have liked to have seen some estimate of how many people have these devices implanted every year. The story makes it clear that there are multiple companies pursing a similar device and that one is already on the market. The story does not rely on a news release.",0
"This story discussed costs in the context of overall sales figures. “Deciding how best to get smokers to quit for good is a public health challenge. Sales of the nicotine replacement products have risen, Connolly says. Sales totaled $45 million in 1984, when nicotine gum was introduced. Since 1997, sales have totaled more than $800 million annually.” We wish the story had included some examples of the costs of the individual products compared to cigarettes. The cost of 8 weeks of the nicotine patch is approximately $160-200. The story, like the others, provides no hard numbers for quantifying the benefits, but we thought it did an adequate job explaining what the study found. Unlike the NY Times and LA Times stories, this one provided accurate information about the number of subjects who started and completed the study. All three of the stories have the same problem of not explaining whether ultimately two-thirds of the study participants relapsed or the same one-third relapsed at two different intervals. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt with a satisfactory score on this. None of the stories mentioned the potential harms from taking nicotine, as opposed to quitting cold turkey. Nor did they mention the additional risks associated with continuing to smoke instead of making use of a more successful smoking cessation program that would actually help a smoker quit. As the leading risk factor for early death, smoking should be stopped as quickly and effectively as possible. The story, like the others, did a fair job explaining the study design. This one excelled by explaining a key fact about the study. “Most did not use the products. For instance, at the first interview, 77% did not use them. Those who did use them did so for various time periods. At the first interview, the 33% of those who used the products did so for more than six weeks.” This gets to both a potential problem with how comprehensive the study might be and whether it is a good measure of the products’ effectiveness. This isn’t just a question of whether people were compliant. It’s a question of whether the study could adequately judge the products’ effectiveness given the size of the cohort and varying lengths of time people took the drugs. The New York Times story indicates that the lengths of time did not matter, but none of the stories fully addressed this point. No disease mongering. We give the story a pass here because it includes one independent source with good perspective on both the study’s strengths and drawbacks. Half of the people quoted in the story, though, either work for Glaxo or receive funding from Glaxo. The story gave a good, independent perspective about the fact that the preponderance of evidence is leaning toward a combination therapy of drugs and counseling. We like that this story was very specific on what types of nicotine products were studied. “The participants told whether they had used a patch, gum, inhaler, or spray. They told how long they used the product continuously.” The story says that the new study gives a more “real world” picture of nicotine replacement therapies. The story did not rely on any press release.",0
"On 8 July 2015, Change.org user Ryan Koch of Des Moines initiated a petition on that site seeking to “Change the name of Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel.” That petition appeared at a time of heightened racial controversy in the United States: in particular, while debate was ongoing about whether display of the Confederate flag should be retired to primarily historical contexts in the wake of a racially-motivated shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina, church on 17 June 2015. The petition facetiously suggested that the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store chain of restaurants and gift shops employed an “offensive slur” in its name: I say all of us European Americans start protesting C****er Barrel. It uses an offensive slur and it is deeply offensive and mocks our long and proud heritage. The name is offensive, their logo stereotypes European Americans as people who sit on chairs and lean against what appears to be a bourbon barrel, claiming we are all a bunch of alcoholics. Sure, they’ll SAY it’s a “cracker” barrel but everyone knows crackers don’t come in barrels, they come in bags and boxes! Change the name C****er Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. After all, white people should have something to be offended by, too! The petition was popular on social media sites, where some users found it clever (and others claimed the joke as their own): I demand that Cracker Barrel immediately change its name to Caucasian Barrel because I am offended — Jamey McMahan (@jameymcmahan75) July 10, 2015 Since @Redskins name is offensive, we should change the @CrackerBarrel name next. #RedskinsNation pic.twitter.com/v9rWHs61YD — David (@dpartenio) July 10, 2015  We need to change the name Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. I find the word ‘cracker’ highly offensive. — Tyler Lovett (@DontYouLovett) July 10, 2015  The petition suggested the name “Cracker Barrel” was suspect, as “everyone knows crackers don’t come in barrels.” However, an obituary for Cracker Barrel founder Dan Evins published in the Washington Post in 2012 gave the following explanation for the chain’s nomenclature: To distinguish his station from others, he added a small restaurant and gift shop and called the outfit Cracker Barrel — a reference to old-time country stores where people played checkers atop barrels used to carry crackers and other wares. According to NPR, the pejorative term “cracker” was essentially “reclaimed” by poor white people well before the Cracker Barrel chain existed: By the early 1800s, those immigrants to the South started to refer to themselves that way as a badge of honor and a term of endearment. After his tongue-in-cheek petition garnered a good deal of attention, Ryan Koch clarified that it was not meant to be regarded as anything other than a form of satirical expression: I started this satirical petition in lieu [sic] of constant media reports of various groups and organizations constantly wanting to change things throughout the country because they claim they are offended. The petition was meant to shed light on how ridiculous all of the political correctness currently going on in the country is, and how we should focus on real issues such as crime, unemployment, veteran suicide, and corrupt politics rather than cater to everyone who feels they need to be offended. I do not in any way feel the need for, or want Cracker Barrel to change their name. I do not have any ill feelings towards the restaurant chain, and I enjoy dining at their locations frequently. I am not expecting a response from Cracker Barrel in regards to this petition, as they were not involved in the creation of it. Neither Cracker Barrel nor anyone who reads the petition should take its purpose of changing the name seriously. The petition is strictly for satirical and comedic purposes to show how ridiculous political correctness is getting in America. Cracker Barrel themselves said of the issue that: Cracker Barrel is aware of this satirical petition and recognizes that individuals have the right to express their opinion on all types of things. At Cracker Barrel, our mission is Pleasing People. While we respect the opinions of these individuals, our brand is well-known as a home away from home so we have no plans to change our name as it is synonymous with great food and great service. Thousands of people have since signed the “Change the name of Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel” petition, but it doesn’t seem many (if any) considered the missive anything other than a critique of a culture that detractors feel has become too sensitive. On 15 September 2016, a web site covered the ancient nontroversy and revived the rumor that “liberals” sought to change the name of Cracker Barrel, but the petition on which that claim was based remains purely a satirical one.",1
"The news release makes no mention of the potential cost of the device. A potential source of comparison is Ab toner and waist trimmer electronic belts of various brands sold at Walmart. They vary from the $21.25 Healthmate Forever AB Muscle Stimulation Multi Belt, to the $149 Ab Transform Pro Abdominal, Arm and Leg Training System. The release provides quantification of the benefits of the device but would have been a lot stronger with a better description of what some of the numbers mean. It states: “The reduction in the visceral fat area was 5.37 sq. cm in the 2 treatment per week group, 14.24 sq. cm in the 4 per week group and 16.45 sq. cm in the 7 per week group. Declines in HbA1c were 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.65% in the 2, 4, and 7 treatment-per-week groups respectively.” It also stated, “About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes” in reference to the first study. (HbA1c refers to glycated haemoglobin (A1c), which identifies average plasma glucose concentration.) But the release doesn’t explain the relationship between lowering of HbA1c and improvements in heat shock protein, an important underpinning of the research. The information detailed in the graphic, while related to the basic research, is confusing since it relates to the animal and not the human research described in the release. A statement from the lead investigator appears premature. Dr. Kondo commented: “Even in patients who have difficulty exercising, such as those who are overweight, elderly, or have some form of disability, this device can be expected to provide acceptable treatment in addition to conventional diabetic medical care.” The belt device is claimed to be well tolerated, but no details on potential harms are given. The release notes: “The team found that a suitable combination of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) activated HSP72 more efficiently.” What is the electrical stimulus and how uncomfortable is it? Exactly what is a delivery of heat shock? What temperature is used? And finally is the device battery operated or is it a plug in? All of these unanswered questions seem relevant to understanding the device. The release describes the study methods — the number of participants, the length of treatment, and the results. But the release would have been stronger with a discussion of the study limitations. According to the published study, limitations included its “relatively small sample size and no setting of appropriate placebo control because this apparatus simultaneously delivers heat and mild electric stimulation, both of which are easily recognized by subjects.” No disease mongering here. The release provides a good description of the mechanics of Type 2 diabetes. The release might have been improved with a brief discussion of the prevalence of the disease. The news release notes that the study was funded by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research. The journal article in Scientific Reports also acknowledges the belt device was provided by the Tsuchiya Rubber Co., Ltd. (Kumamoto, Japan). The release mentions exercise and a drug commonly prescribed in Japan to treat Type 2 diabetes, and notes that using the device “One can expect the effects to be similar to exercise therapy.” It also quotes a researcher who suggests the belt could be an add-on to conventional diabetic medical care. But the release provides no indication of how the device actually compares with these existing treatments in terms of outcomes. Even though the researchers advanced from theoretical thinking to animal and human trials there is no discussion of when the device might become available to patients. Heat shock protein has been explored as an important factor in Type 2 diabetes by other researchers. The researchers have taken the basic research and moved it one step closer to patients. The news release doesn’t employ sensational language.",1
"In December 2017, a viral video left millions of people saddened and horrified by the sight of an emaciated polar bear forced to scavenge in trash cans for food on Canada’s Baffin Island. Photographer Paul Nicklen posted the video on Facebook, garnering almost 30,000 shares within a week, as well as the attention of the national news media. Nicklen, who is also co-founder of the environmental nonprofit group SeaLegacy, wrote: My entire Sea Legacy team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear. It’s a soul-crushing scene that still haunts me, but I know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy. This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It’s a slow, painful death. When scientists say polar bears will be extinct in the next 100 years, I think of the global population of 25,000 bears dying in this manner. There is no band aid solution. There was no saving this individual bear. People think that we can put platforms in the ocean or we can feed the odd starving bear. The simple truth is this — if the Earth continues to warm, we will lose bears and entire polar ecosystems. The video was subsequently shared by National Geographic, which reported: Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear’s back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. The footage is real. Nicklen says it was captured “a few months” before December 2017, at an abandoned Inuit camp on Baffin Island, the enormous land mass southwest of Greenland in the Canadian Arctic. There appears to be no doubt that the animal is suffering from starvation, as National Geographic wrote: The bear’s thin frame and protruding bones are clear indicators of this, and its atrophied muscles suggest it’s been starving for an extended period of time. However, the causes of the bear’s condition were a little bit more complicated. Polar bears live only in the Arctic and eat only meat, their main source being seals. They rely on Arctic seawater to freeze into ice, where they can gain access to seals. But climate change means that these Arctic ice sheets are reducing in size, lowering the number of seals available to polar bears and ultimately, causing them to starve. The risk is higher in places like Baffin Island, where polar bears depend on seasonal ice. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the issue is likely about to become dramatically worse: Recent predictions suggest that warming seawater and air will melt 20 percent or more of the Arctic’s ice cover in the next 40 years — a scary statistic for the many species in the Arctic that rely on seasonal ice cover for vital activities such as breeding and eating. However, Dr. Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for the non-profit Polar Bears International, said in a blog post that climate change may not have been the direct or sole contributing factor in this particular animal’s demise:  Polar bears have few natural predators. Although they normally live a long time, they are not immortal. All eventually die and most do so because they have not been able to capture enough food. This means that malnutrition is a major cause of death for polar bears. Young bears that have not learned well enough how to catch seals, old feeble bears, and bears that have injured themselves, all can succumb to malnutrition under some circumstances. The starvation leading to the event shown in this video could be related to old age, injury (like a broken jaw or teeth that prevent it from catching food), disease, or other factors limiting its success in obtaining prey. However, Amstrup points out that the continued diminishment of sea ice that is expected will make it harder for polar bears in this region to find seals to eat, and therefore make starvation much more likely for sick, lame, very young or very old animals who might otherwise have survived: The problem is that an ever-warmer future means polar bears will have less and less access to their seal prey, so the rate at which bears die from malnutrition/starvation will increase. So, regardless of the proximate cause of this bear’s condition, this heart-wrenching footage provides us with a warning about the future. Hunters from Inuit communities on Baffin Island were also skeptical over whether to link the bear’s condition with climate change; Eric Ootoovak, the vice-chair of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization, said of the bear: You can really tell he’s sick. He’s not starving. If he was starving, he’d be able to move a bit more than that. Nick Arnalukjuak, who leads a similar group in the island community of Nunavut, called it part of a “normal cycle” for some bears to suffer injury or illness, adding:",0
"Alarmed by images of the Greenland ice sheets melting and the Amazon rain forests burning, students and workers abandoned schools, shops and offices in nearly every corner of the globe, aiming to stop what they see as a looming environmental catastrophe. The protests started in the Pacific islands, where rising sea levels threaten a way of life, and followed the sun across Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and on to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. The coordinated student “strike” culminated in New York’s Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry. Massive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, chanting “Save our planet!” while anticipating an address by Thunberg, an international figure who sailed across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht ahead of next week’s climate summit at the United Nations. “Right now we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,” Thunberg told tens of thousands of people gathered at a park with a view of the Statue of Liberty. Once she took the stage, the crowd chanted her name, then went silent to hang on her every word. As she paused between sentences, people erupted into applause. “If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you. Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not,” she concluded. Demonstrators in Paris raised a painting of Thunberg as the Virgin Mary, a halo around her head reading, “Our house is on fire.”     “She’s like the icon of our generation,” New York protester Fiamma Cochrane, 17, said, highlighting the leadership role of young people in the international movement to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. Four million people participated worldwide including 300,000 in New York, organizers with the anti-fossil fuels group 350.org said. Reuters could not verify the crowd sizes. Concern has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the international Paris Accord on climate change and took a series of steps to dismantle environmental protections, including moving on Thursday to block stricter vehicle emissions standards in California. Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are among the world’s only national leaders who publicly question the science of climate change, and they are not taking part in next week’s U.N. climate summit. Thousands gathered across Brazil to take aim at Bolsonaro, who they say is allowing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest to clear space for soy beans and cattle ranching. In August, fires there surged to their greatest level since 2010. “The policy of the Bolsonaro government is the policy of environmental destruction and deepening the climate crisis ... this is why we’re on strike,” said Marcela Pimentel Miranda, an organizer for Youth for Climate’s affiliate in Brasilia. One protester in Sao Paulo held up a picture of Bolsonaro and Trump beneath the hand-written “Abolish fossil fools!”   Demonstrators in Thailand stormed the environment ministry and feigned death, while activists in Berlin and Munich stood on  melting blocks of ice with nooses around their necks to symbolize the earth’s fate when the polar ice caps melt. Protesters in Warsaw staged a performance of people drowning in a sea of plastic waste. “The planet is getting hotter than my imaginary boyfriend,” read a poster held by a teenager in Thailand. “Make love, not CO2” signs were spotted in Berlin and Vienna. While Europeans filled the streets, students in the Solomon Islands gathered at the rising ocean water’s edge wearing traditional grass skirts. The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels. Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, according to scientists. “There is no Planet B,” read a sign hoisted by a young woman in London. In Kenya, around 500 activists marched to demand that the government cancel plans for a coal plant and investigate corruption in hydropower dams. “In Samburu there is a lot of heat, the grass has dried up, there is little water,” said Francis Lentel, a young herdsman in traditional beads, holding a picture of the Earth weeping. The protest movement is putting increasing pressure on governments and companies to respond. German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition during all-night talks. Private industry has also responded. Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos on Thursday pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon neutral by 2040. Hundreds of workers from Google, Amazon and other technology companies on Friday criticized their industry for being slow to tackle climate change and joined marches in San Francisco and Seattle calling for action.",0
"""During a July 10, 2011, appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty about the origins of homosexuality. Here’s their exchange:  Gregory: """"Let me ask you about social policy. You've notably said that you're a big fan of Lady Gaga, and even the song Born This Way. There's a lot of debate about a gay marriage pledge in Iowa. And related to that, I wonder, do you agree with some of those who are behind that, that being gay is a choice?"""" Pawlenty: """"Well, I have two teenage daughters who listen to Lady Gaga, so I'm subjected to it. And it has some good qualities to it. But as to, as to gay marriage, I'm in support of traditional marriage as between a man and a woman. I have not supported the issues of allowing gay couples to have the same benefits ... as traditional couples. And so this is an issue in Iowa and across the whole country. But I've stood in favor of traditional marriage and traditional relationships in that regard. Gregory: """"Is being gay a choice?"""" Pawlenty: """"Well, the science in that regard is in dispute. I mean, the scientists work on that and try to figure out if it's behavioral...""""  Gregory: """"Right."""" Pawlenty: """"...or if it's partly genetic."""" Gregory:""""What do you think?"""" Pawlenty: """"Well, I defer to the scientists in that regard."""" Gregory: """"So you, you think it's not a choice."""" Pawlenty: """"Well, there is no....""""  Gregory: """"That you are, as Lady Gaga says, you're born that way."""" Pawlenty: """"There's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic. We don't know that. So we don't know to what extent, you know, it's behavioral, and that's something that's been debated by scientists for a long time. But as I understand the science, there's no current conclusion that it's genetic."""" We decided to rate two of Pawlenty’s statements separately. In another item, we’ll look at whether scientists are """"in dispute"""" about whether being gay is a choice. In this item, we’ll look at Pawlenty’s claim that """"there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic."""" Pawlenty’s word choice -- """"genetic"""" -- is pivotal for rating the accuracy of his claim. The way he phrased it, he’s pretty close to accurate. But if he’d said instead that """"there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is biological,"""" he would have been incorrect. Since the significance of this distinction may not be obvious at first glance, we’ll explain it in detail here. If a trait is """"genetic,"""" it means that it comes from the genes encoded in your DNA. Furthermore, arguing that something is genetic suggests that there’s a single, or at least a well-defined, genetic source -- what has sometimes been called a """"gay gene."""" By contrast, if a trait is """"biological"""" in origin, it means that it can stem from any number of factors, such as hormone levels or how a fetus develops in the uterus. It would not, however, originate primarily from environmental factors such as childhood experiences -- what one might call the """"nurture"""" part of the nature/nurture divide. The typical way of figuring out whether something is caused by genes is through twin studies. Since identical twins share 100 percent of their DNA, any observed differences in traits would be presumed to be influenced by environment rather than genetics. So if being gay was truly, and exclusively, a genetic trait, every set of identical twins should either be both straight, or both gay. In fact, that’s not the case. Even the studies with the strongest linkage show about a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins. Other studies have shown lower rates. Based on these findings, scientists agree that being gay is not caused exclusively by genes. However, being gay does appear to have a genetic component -- just a weaker one. The same study that showed roughly a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins also showed weaker correlations for fraternal twins, who share only 50 percent of their genes on average. That’s pretty much what you’d expect to see if genetics played a role, but not a dominant one. """"Pawlenty is surely right that a genetic explanation has not been proven, and indeed genetics is likely a modest influence on sexual orientation,"""" said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who undertook the twin study that showed a 50 percent correlation, as well as another that showed lower correlations. But if being gay is not primarily determined by genes, it doesn’t mean that its origin isn’t biological. Bailey and others find some of the most convincing evidence of the inherent nature of sexual orientation in long-term studies of the rare cases in which hormonally normal boys are reared as girls due to either accidents or certain medical conditions that have left them less obviously male. He said there have been six published cases of hormonally normal males reassigned early as females, and invariably, their sexual orientation was toward females. That’s consistent with their prenatal gender, not with their rearing as girls. The point of these studies is that sexual orientation -- one’s attractions and impulses -- runs very deep and is resistant to social and environmental factors. """"If you can't make a male attracted to other males by cutting off his penis, castrating him, and rearing him as a girl, how likely is any social explanation of male homosexuality?"""" Bailey asks. Scientists freely acknowledge that the precise pathways for imparting sexual orientation are not yet understood. """"Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation – heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors,"""" the American Psychological Association has put it. However, just because scientists don’t know the specific mechanisms that cause sexual orientation doesn’t mean that they aren’t confident that they are biological in nature. """"We do not really know in any definitive way the mix between biological and other explanations, but the evidence for biological contributions is as good or better than for any other factor,"""" said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office. """"Some have suggested that it’s how you were reared or a failure in bonding to the same-sex parent. But the research to support that is abysmal."""" Jack Drescher, a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, added that """"you’d be hard-pressed to find a reputable scientist who would exclude some aspect of biology"""" from the causes of homosexuality. Drescher is a member of the working group on sexual and gender-identity disorders for the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM 5-- the authoritative reference work in the field. At this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we’ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research has been much less extensive. We struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings. So where does this leave us? Pawlenty said """"there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic."""" On that specific question, we found broad agreement that Pawlenty was correct. Scientists told us that genetics may play a role in determining sexual orientation, but the current evidence suggests that it’s not the dominant factor and may ultimately be shown to play just a modest role. But a modest role is still different from no role. And we also think that viewers of the interview might be led to believe that because homosexuality is not primarily caused by genes, there’s no biological cause. In reality, most scientists do believe that sexual orientation is caused by biology, rather than by choice.""",0
"""A bill requiring physicians to treat infants who survive abortion attempts is moving through the Legislature without the usual partisan fight, though some lawmakers have questioned whether it addresses an ongoing problem. An anti-abortion activist used a specific figure in a recent committee hearing to reassure lawmakers HB 1129/SB 1636 is necessary. """"The tragedy of infants born alive following attempted abortions is real,"""" said Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, on April 9. """"It is not the hypothetical that is sometimes reported. In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year."""" Yoest said without elaborating there are two cases in Florida. After the meeting, reporters asked Yoest about the number she used. Yoest told them the figure came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC, which collects data from most state health departments on the number of legal induced abortions performed each year, does not collect data on infants who die after surviving abortion attempts. Neither does the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports women’s access to abortions and collects abortion data. Neither Guttmacher nor the CDC has published its 2010 data for abortions. """"We have no idea where this number comes from,"""" said Rebecca Wind, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman. A committee analysis says there is no federal requirement to report the number of infants born alive during an attempted abortions. So Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, included in his legislation a requirement for physicians who perform abortions in Florida to report cases of infants born alive to the state. """"If in two years time or four years time we find that there are zero cases, it’s a prayer answered,"""" Pigman said at an April 4 committee hearing of his bill. """"If we find in two years time that there’s a half dozen cases a year, then we have some issues."""" If there are no statistics or reporting requirements, where did Americans United for Life find this figure? We dug in. Twenty-eight states have laws protecting infants born alive. """"Infants Born Alive"""" mirrors a federal law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Supporters say it is necessary to enact a state law so there is no doubt that an infant """"born alive"""" -- defined as an infant who breathes or has heartbeats or muscle movements, regardless of whether the extraction method was natural or induced  -- must be taken to a hospital for treatment appropriate for gestation age. A failed abortion could result in a live birth in a late-term abortion, which can only be performed if two physicians agree the mother's life is at risk, or if the mother was further into her pregnancy than thought. Physicians under the Florida proposal would have to provide medical care for an infant born alive after an abortion or face a first-degree misdemeanor charge. Pigman, an emergency physician, has referenced similar or exact figures as Yoest in committee hearings, but he characterized them differently and stressed the lack of exact data. In the bill’s first hearing, Pigman mentioned CDC data on deaths for infants from 22 weeks of gestation to seven days after birth called """"other perinatal conditions."""" This category -- which totaled 1,270 deaths in 2010 -- is further broken down into categories of international medical codes for causes of death, including cardiovascular disorders (838 deaths), digestive system disorders (92 deaths), undefined cerebral problems (183 deaths) and """"other conditions originating in the perinatal period"""" (130 deaths). """"I don’t know which portion of that 1,270 were due to abortions or some other rare circumstances,"""" Pigman said in the April 4 committee. Inside that latter subcategory -- """"other conditions originating in the perinatal period"""" -- is a designation called """"termination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn."""" The CDC doesn’t have numbers for that designation for 2010 yet. In 2008, the CDC reported 33 deaths using that designation. Whether the abortion was elective or performed to save the life of the mother is unclear. Americans United for Life spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick said any number is problematic because abortion data is always incomplete. California, for instance, is one of a few states that does not report the number of abortion procedures that happen there. Hamrick directed us to a blog post written by the group's legal team about limited CDC data and anecdotal evidence of infants born alive, including two Florida cases of infants surviving abortion procedures (one died, one survived with catastrophic injuries) and the trial of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell. The post does not support Yoest's specific claim about 1,270 infants who die after abortion procedures, offering instead the more nuanced breakdown for the 1,270 figure that we heard from Pigman. Our ruling Yoest said 1,270 infants in 2010 """"were reported to have died following attempted abortions."""" The figure is based on an """"other"""" category of perinatal deaths, but it does not mean what she says it means. Included in this category are babies who die of various other issues, mainly heart problems. We rate her statement .""",1
"""In the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Gov. Rick Perry again defended his foiled 2007 attempt to require Texas girls to be vaccinated against a virus that can cause cervical cancer. Perry, responding to U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann’s charge that his Feb. 2, 2007, order intended to mandate the shots for human papillomavirus, or HPV, was an inappropriate result of lobbying by his former chief of staff, said: """"I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage 4 cervical cancer. I spent a lot of time with her. She came by my office, talked to me about this program."""" Did a cancer patient urge Perry to issue the order later nulled by Texas legislators? Nearly three weeks after Perry issued the order, it was widely reported that a Houston woman with late-stage cervical cancer had visited with him. As reported in the Feb. 20, 2007, Austin American-Statesman, Heather Burcham of Houston spoke to reporters summoned by Perry as numerous legislators were indicating they would try to cancel the order. Burcham said then: """"The vaccine has done its job if it saves one person from cancer, let alone knocks out cervical cancer altogether."""" She also signed up to testify at a Texas House hearing, the Statesman reported, but left before she was called to speak. Earlier in the day, she said she wanted to spend the time she had left sharing her story: """"It's my wildest dream come true that I get to maybe reach one person, that my life would not be in vain, that I have lived for a purpose and that I won't die and never have done anything,"""" she said. Fast forward. Shortly after the Sept. 22 debate, ABC News said Perry did not meet Burcham until after he’d issued his order. Its news article says Perry """"met Burcham while she was lobbying the Texas legislature to uphold the governor’s executive order. The Legislature ultimately ruled against Burcham and Perry and did away with the vaccine mandate."""" The network, crediting a recent report by Houston’s KTRK-TV, said Perry and Burcham """"struck up a friendship despite the Texas Legislature revoking the governor’s mandate. Perry invited Burcham to a ranch, rode motorcycles with her and even sat at her bed during her final days. Burcham died in July 2007."""" A pre-debate ABC News post, dated Sept. 15, 2011, specifies that Perry and Burcham struck up the friendship after he issued the order. According to a Sept. 23, 2011, Houston Chronicle blog post, Perry spokesman Mark Miner confirmed that Burcham met Perry when she began lobbying the lawmakers to uphold his order. The post quotes Miner saying: """"It was a very inspirational passionate story that he heard from her and he met with her away from the cameras and really built up a relationship with this young girl. Yes, he had (already) signed it, but it was still going through the legislative process. It had a heavy impact on him."""" As noted Sept. 17, 2011, by Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Bud Kennedy, Perry’s YouTube posts include a video of Burcham, in a hospital bed, shown at a May 2007 Perry press conference. Seated in a bed, Burcham says: """"I want to change as many people’s lives as I can because I know there is nothing I can do for my own life, but there is something that I can do for others ... It is so important that parents get their children this vaccination."""" Finally, we interviewed Houston developer Craig Wilson, who said Burcham lived with his family off and on for about a decade before she died. Wilson said he doesn’t recall the exact date that Burcham met Perry, though they developed a relationship when she was urging legislators not to unplug the order. """"He did everything he could to make her life better,"""" Wilson said, ultimately spending three hours at her bedside before she died and later delivering a eulogy. """"This shows his character as a human being."""" Our ruling: Perry had an ally in Heather Burcham in 2007, but only after he issued his order. In the debate, in contrast, Perry brought up Burcham’s heartfelt advocacy while not speaking to criticism he had been lobbied into the order by a former aide representing a drug company. His statement misled by creating the impression Burcham swayed him to proceed with the executive order. In reality, by all accounts, that just didn’t happen. We rate Perry’s statement .""",1
"""The story fails to indicate how much a Pap test costs, or whether the new guidelines would cost or save money.

"The cost of adding these foods to your diet would be negligible for most people, although taking supplements over long periods could pose a significant cost. The news release mentions only potential benefits for human beings. There’s no data on how much of these substances might need to be consumed over what period of time and in what quantity to offer cancer protection or tumor shrinkage. A researcher’s comment that “we were able to inhibit tumor growth in mice without toxicity” sheds no meaningful light on these questions. Also, the news release seems to contradict itself by suggesting that eating a diet containing cancer-fighting substances could offer a benefit, but later quoting a researcher saying, “We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.” This comment seems to suggest people would have to take a supplement in order to get a benefit. Plant chemicals are generally considered safe, but there’s potential for toxicity if they’re consumed in combination with certain drugs or at high concentrations. There’s added risk for consumers who buy these substances in the form of dietary supplements, which are not tightly regulated by the FDA. The news release neglects to caution that studying how compounds perform in mouse and human cell lines and in animals doesn’t predict how they will perform in human beings. Extensive human trials are required before any conclusions can be drawn about safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the release touts the potential benefit of these dietary factors: “These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body.”  However, it is a huge leap to think even if these compounds could reduce inflammation to a clinically important degree that it would also provide better cancer control. The release doesn’t engage in overt disease mongering. It describes prostate cancer as “the most common cancer afflicting U.S. men.” That’s true, if you don’t count skin cancer. It’s No. 2 to lung cancer when it comes to causing male deaths. The news release states that funders include that National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas System, and there were no conflicts of interest that we could find. While there’s no proven strategy to prevent prostate cancer, there is general advice for reducing overall cancer risk such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising, and eating a variety of plant foods. Current treatment options include watchful waiting, active surveillance, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. These aren’t mentioned. Speaking of prevention and treatment in the same release really oversimplifies the issues. There are studies showing that chemoprevention with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although the FDA will not allow manufacturers to suggest these compounds prevent cancer because these agents were associated with an increased risk for high-grade cancers. Treatment options completely depend upon the stage of the cancer–thus range from conservative management to aggressive attempts at curative therapy to palliative care. The role of these substances in any of these settings is obviously completely unknown. These foods can be obtained at most grocery stores; availability is not a question. The release could have lent more clarity by telling readers whether supplements are available. For example, resveratrol supplements are available and have been extensively studied for diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. The news release provides perspective, stating that the research “uses a novel analytical approach to screen numerous plant-based chemicals instead of testing a single agent as many studies do, discovering specific combinations that shrink prostate cancer tumors.” The claim of novelty seems appropriate regarding the approach to screening. It also states that the research “demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together. Combining ursolic acid with either curcumin or resveratrol prevents cancer cells from gobbling something that they need to grow, glutamine.” Finally, it acknowledges previous research that has “highlighted the potential therapies found in plants, including chemicals found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and green tea.” We rate this as unjustifiable for the over-reaching headline: “Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner.” That’s exacerbated by the lead: “When you dine on curry and baked apples, enjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving — or even preventing — cancer.”",1
"""In a Republican primary, it's often hard to find major policy issues where the candidates disagree.That's why Rick Scott, the former health care CEO running for governor, is trying to make the most of a perceived policy difference with Attorney General Bill McCollum.In new direct mail pieces, Scott is claiming that McCollum supports embryonic stem cell research. Scott, meanwhile, says he would work to ban any embryonic stem cell research in Florida. """"Career politician Bill McCollum -- Testing stem cells. Testing our values,"""" the mailer reads. """"Bill McCollum supports embryonic stem cell research. Bill McCollum holds the same position on this issue as Barack Obama, who recently lifted a ban on funding for embryonic stem cell research. """"McCollum disputed Scott's mailer, calling it false (and Scott """"ruthless"""") in an interview with the Associated Press on June 7, 2010. """"That's just absolutely not true. I don't know where he got that from,"""" McCollum said.Sounds like a case for PolitiFact Florida.For this fact-check, we're going to detail to McCollum's public position on embryonic stem cell research, and then President Obama's. Then we'll see if they're the same, as Scott claims.McCollum's positionEmbryonic stem cells are harvested from embryos that are four or five days old. In almost every case, the stem cells are extracted from left-over embryos created by women attempting to get pregnant through invitro fertilization. Scientists say embryonic stem cells hold great potential, and can be used to test new drugs and have unique regenerative capabilities that could unlock treatments for heart disease, diabetes and other diseases. The embryos are destroyed in the process.To best understand McCollum's position on embryonic stem cell research, we need to start back in 1996 when McCollum was a congressman from Central Florida.That year, Congress attached an amendment to an appropriations bill that limited or banned federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. The Dickey Amendment -- named for Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey --- said that the federal government could not fund the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes or fund research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death.The appropriations bill -- and the amendment -- passed 371-42. McCollum voted for the measure.The Dickey Amendment hardly ended the discussion, however, nor ultimately clarifies McCollum's position. The NIH produced a legal opinion that essentially created a loophole in the proviso. The federal government could not use tax dollars to create embryonic stem cells, the NIH said, but it could fund research on privately-created stem cell lines.Former President Bill Clinton's administration began crafting policies to fund embryonic stem cell research, but control of the White House changed before the new policies were implemented.Enter President George W. Bush.In August 2001, Bush essentially restated U.S. policy with an executive order.Bush gave a nationally televised speech, outlining his position -- that the federal government could and should fund research on the 60 or so embryonic stem cell lines already in existence, but that it would not fund research on new or future embryonic stem cell lines.Now, jump to the elections of 2004.Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry promised if elected to open new embryonic stem cell lines to federal funding. Bush maintained his opposition.The dichotomy between Kerry and Bush trickled down the Florida Republican Senate primary that year between McCollum and Mel Martinez.Martinez supported Bush's restrictions and pressed McCollum to stake out a position. Throughout 2004, newspapers generically said McCollum favored increased embryonic stem cell research, but provided little context.In July 2004, McCollum said: ''I think appropriate funding for embryonic stem cell research is a pro-life position. It conforms completely with my faith and my belief in the unborn and my belief of when life begins. And I'm one with my conscience and with my Lord. ''Then, in an August 2004 debate, Martinez fired a second bullet on the stem cell issue.According to the Miami Herald accounting of the debate, Martinez said:""""What you should do is define yourself. Do you support President Bush on stem-cell research or do you not?"""" Martinez said. """"Or will you continue to side with John Kerry on this very important issue, and one, frankly, that's becoming a dividing issue in the presidential contest? """"McCollum interrupted, the Herald reported.""""Mr. Martinez, you know that I do not believe in stem-cell research that takes a life. """"McCollum then pointed out that other conservatives support the research, and the Herald reported that McCollum has said that test-tube-fertilized embryos that are to be discarded at fertility clinics are not technically human life. He said they should be used for scientific experiments to cure diseases. McCollum lost the primary, and his position on embryonic stem cell research was not questioned again. Until now.Spokeswoman Kristy Campbell explained his current thinking. """"The general has been consistent on this issue,"""" Campbell said.

"""On Thursday – which was the unofficial stoner holiday of 4/20 – supporters of legal marijuana and opponents of the U.S. """"war on drugs"""" took to the internet to make the case for their causes. One widely shared image made an unexpected implication – that decriminalizing drugs could be a pro-police move. It features images of police destroying liquor bottles and marijuana plants, with this text: """"Did you know? More American police officers died during prohibition of alcohol than any other time in history. 300 died in 1930 alone. After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs."""" A quick Google search showed us the image has been popping up on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other websites – and that it has been making the rounds since at least 2015. The message is clear: When the government bans popular substances, like liquor or marijuana, black market trade makes life more dangerous for those enforcing the ban. We wondered, however, if the data actually supported that message. The war on drugs Marijuana and other drugs had been illegal in the United States for years before the federal government – under President Richard Nixon, as the image correctly states – launched what we now call the """"war on drugs."""" In June 1971 Nixon declared """"a full-scale attack on the problem of drug abuse in America."""" He called for harsher drug laws and millions of dollars in extra spending, and Congress complied. Today, spending on the drug war has continued to grow, and the United States has either the largest or second-largest prison population in the world. Yet marijuana remains popular. A CBS poll released Thursday found 61 percent of Americans favor legalizing pot and 33 percent are opposed. It also found 88 percent of Americans support medical marijuana. A 2015 National Institute on Drug Abuse survey reported that 22.2 million people – 7 percent of the U.S. population – had used pot within the last month. That’s about twice the rate at which people are abusing the second-most popular drug, illicit prescription painkillers (see fact-checks on opioids here, here and here). A deadly job? Comparing Prohibition with the drug war is common in American culture. Just listen to the popular 1988 country song """"Copperhead Road"""" by Steve Earle, about a man from an Appalachian moonshining clan who switches the family business to weed. But is it also fair to compare police deaths during the two periods? That’s a little iffy. It’s correct that 1930 was the deadliest year in U.S. history for police. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officer deaths going back to 1791, says 307 officers died in 1930. It’s also correct that police deaths decreased sharply after Prohibition. But the numbers behind the claim that """"police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs"""" are a bit off. Nixon began the war on drugs in 1971, but police deaths actually topped 200 the year before that in 1970. And that wasn’t any sort of a spike – the number of deaths had been just below 200 all throughout the late 1960s. And that’s not the only thing wrong with this claim. Not all deaths are violent The image clearly uses the violence associated with organized crime to make its point. However, not every officer who dies in any given year is killed by someone else in the line of duty. Many officers die from car crashes, illnesses and other causes. Yet the data this viral post cites on police deaths includes all deaths of police officers each year – violent and non-violent, on-duty and off-duty. In 2007, according to the memorial group, 202 officers died. According to FBI data, 57 of those officers were killed by a criminal while on duty. That means nearly three-fourths of the deaths that year were not the kind of violent deaths this image is alluding to. And even while on duty that year, an officer was more likely to have been killed in an accident than by a criminal. Fewer police deaths We focused on 2007 for a reason. In the last 36 years, only 2007 and 2001 (due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks) have had more than 200 officer deaths. Yet the typical person who sees this image might very well believe that 200 or more police officers are continuing to die each year during the war on drugs. In reality that’s only happened 12 times, and only twice since 1981. Nicholas Kristof wrote in 2015 that toddlers are killed by guns more often than on-duty police officers are. And whatever the cause of officers' deaths in a given period, the war on drugs still doesn’t compare to Prohibition, when for 14 years an average of 252 officers died every year. Since Prohibition ended more than 80 years ago, however, there have been more than 250 officer deaths only twice – in 1973 and 1974. In fact, during most years from the 1990s until today, the number of officer deaths has been roughly the same as 100 years ago, when there were far fewer officers. Our ruling A viral image making the rounds on 4/20 compared the number of police officer deaths during Prohibition to the drug war: """"After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs,"""" the image said. Those numbers aren’t totally accurate, and the comparison itself is misleading. For one, it counts many officers' deaths that had nothing to do with the prohibition of drugs or alcohol, like an officer who dies of cancer or in a car crash on vacation. And despite the direct comparison between the deadly years of Prohibition and the war on drugs, police deaths have largely been on the decline for decades even as the drug war continues and the number of officers has grown significantly. Since the image uses a semi-accurate statistic to make a misleading comparison.""",1
"The article does an outstanding job of noting the cost of surgery, although the article could have been stronger if it had pointed out the estimated costs of drug therapies, hospitalizations and sometimes institutionalization of children and adults who are severely disabled by some forms of seizure disorders. Although there is some quantification of benefits, the article doesn’t specify the actual number of children who had the primary outcome — a year without seizures. And thus the statement in the lead that brain surgery in the study group can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure free after one year will be difficult for readers to put into perspective. And as noted above, the article does not specify how many operations or what types of surgery were performed on what ages of children. Editor’s note: While the story doesn’t state the absolute amount of children who experienced improvement after surgery compared to the control group, the story does give readers enough information to understand the measured benefits. For this reason, we changed our initial rating from Not Satisfactory to Satisfactory. Seventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery. Harms are explained but again without much quantification. The article describes the general level of evidence but it would have been a much stronger article had it specified the specific types of cognitive and other tests used to evaluate the outcomes in the children. Other details were needed, too: how old the children were; what kind of neurosurgery they had; and what the major limitations of the study were. No mongering. The article does quote a Boston specialist who was not a part of the study, which was conducted in India. The article does note that drug therapies are standard of care, but does not specify what drugs are used. More significantly, because the article does not specify in any real detail what kinds of surgeries were performed on the study group, it is difficult for readers to compare alternatives. Beyond noting that costs are a frequent barrier in India to getting the surgery, the article does not say anything about general availability of the operations, or define categories of candidates. The article notes this is the first trial of its kind in children. This appears to be accurate. There have been very few randomized trials (a recent Cochrane review found only four, and only one compared surgery to medical therapy); there is a recent trial (ERSET) that went down to age 12, but was almost all in adults. One point that’s important to note: There is nothing in the study to support the statement that the earlier surgery is done, the better; only that this shows that it appears to substantially decrease seizure frequency in children, as it has been shown to do in adults. The article quotes outside sources.",0
"The “love bug,” a fly in the Bibionidae family (also known as the honeymoon fly, telephone bug, double-headed bug, united bug, and March fly), is a nuisance any Florida motorist is unhappily more than passingly familiar with. Though these bugs neither bite nor sting, at certain times of the year their sheer numbers transform these innocuous insects into airborne hordes seemingly determined to devil anyone fool enough to take to the road. The adults splatter on windshields, lights, grills, and radiators of motor vehicles, and their dried remains can be difficult to remove. Suicidal pairs of love bugs have been known to cause overheating of motors when large numbers of them are drawn into the cooling systems of liquid-cooled engines. Every May and September these sex-crazed critters become an annoyance bordering on intolerable as the air teems with mating pairs. But the “love bugs” haven’t always been part of the Floridian landscape, thus we’ve seen an abundance of “mad scientist” stories about how the state came to be infested with them. (Love bugs are not solely a Floridian plague; they range throughout the Gulf states and into Mexico and Central America, as well as up into Georgia and South Carolina. But they seem particularly enamored of Florida.) Truth is, Mother Nature is far more to be feared than any mad scientist and is far more capricious. In this case, she inspired some of her children to migrate to a new area, and in doing so prompted the creation of a number of rumors which attempt to explain why these critters came to take up residence in places where they weren’t found before:  Love Bugs are actually man-made. Scientists were genetically engineering females of a species of insect that would mate with the male mosquito, but be sterile and produce no offspring. Unfortunately, they accidentally also created a male Love Bug, and a pair somehow escaped into the wild. Since the bugs had no natural predators, their numbers quickly exploded into the millions. Back when I was a student at Florida State, I was told that love bugs were accidentally released from a biological experiment station at the University of Florida. Supposedly, the lovebug was “created” in a lab at UF by crossing a fly and a mosquito in an attempt to create an enemy for mosquito larva. It supposedly got loose and now populates the whole southern US. Love bugs are not the result of a genetic cloning experiment gone wrong, nor were they unwittingly loosed from a research facility charged with studying exotic insects. They also weren’t bio-engineered as a natural solution to the mosquito problem, as love bugs do not eat mosquitoes. These overly amorous critters are native to Central America; the best guess as to how they came to these United States places them as undiscovered stowaways who arrived by ship in Galveston or New Orleans around 1920. They migrated into Florida in 1947 from Louisiana, looked around, liked what they saw, and decided to stay. Their natural capacity for reproduction took care of the rest. Or, as an academic quoted by the Orlando Sentinel observed (with tongue firmly in cheek): Decades ago, with the mosquito population out of control, the University of Florida’s mad scientists decided to fight back. That’s how the red and black lovebugs were created — or at least that’s how an urban legend says it happened. Philip Koehler, an endowed professor in UF’s entomology department, wasn’t sure how the myth started but said it’s impossible. “If we’d created them, they would be orange and blue,” he said.",1
"""When key state legislators approved a multifaceted amendment to cut the budget and make other high-profile changes to the University of Wisconsin System on June 3, 2011, little attention was paid to item number 27. Labeled """"Liability Protections for Scientific Researchers,"""" the amendment dealt with changes in the state statute regarding """"crimes against animals."""" About a week later, the Wisconsin Humane Society urged its supporters to protest the move, which university researchers said was necessary to protect vital research from the chilling effect of possible lawsuits or criminal prosecutions urged by animal-rights activists. In a news release on June 13, 2011, the Humane Society said the state legislation would """"exempt scientific researchers from all state animal cruelty laws."""" """"Wisconsin law already exempts bona fide scientific researchers from the statutes prohibiting animal mistreatment … and poisoning,"""" the group’s  executive director Anne Reed wrote. """"The budget bill amendment is broader and would exempt researchers from the entirety of Chapter 951, the criminal laws relating to animal cruelty."""" That’s a provocative claim about an apparently major change in state law --  and one that was inserted without public hearing or discussion into a lengthy budget bill. That’s right up our alley. First, a bit of background about the legislation. It grew, in part, out of university concerns about legal liability for researchers in the wake of criminal investigations into the use of sheep and mice in experiments, said Eric Sandgren, director of the UW Research Animal Resources Center. For three decades, UW-Madison used sheep in U.S. Navy-funded experiments related to decompression sickness in divers, Sandgren said. The sheep are euthanized at the end of the experiments. In 2009, Dane County District Attorney Brian Blanchard found that UW-Madison researchers violated the crimes against animals law. He  declined to prosecute, saying it was not intentional or negligent. In 2010, the Alliance for Animals and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) went to court seeking criminal charges against UW officials in connection with 26 sheep that died as a result of decompression experiments, the Madison Capital Times reported. In that case, a Madison special prosecutor appointed by a judge in May 2011 determined university employees broke no laws, but he """"scolded university officials for not having a better system in place for keeping track of state and federal laws,"""" the Capital Times reported. All right, let’s examine the proposed changes. To back up her claim that the budget amendment would exempt researchers from the whole criminal statute, Reed pointed to the proposed amendment approved on June 3 by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. The committee did the preliminary work on the budget, which then went to the Assembly and Senate. The bill markup document creates a new section in Chapter 951, the criminal statute that deals with dognapping, decompression, instigation of fights between animals, nutrition for confined animals and other acts. Under the amendment, the statute would read: """"This chapter does not apply to an animal that is being used for research or experimentation at an educational or research institution or to an animal that is being used for research or experimentation that is regulated under (federal laws)."""" The change, as proposed, affects state criminal prohibitions on animal cruelty written into the statutes decades ago. That sounds sweeping, and, indeed, it is accurate to say that the amendment would exempt university researchers from the state statute providing criminal penalties for animal cruelty, Sandgren said. Sandgren defends the proposal and says it will not lead to more abuse. He points to a federal law, the Animal Welfare Act, that is enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture. That law, another federal law, and UW’s own ethical standards, are enough to keep research within legal standards, Sandgren and other supporters of the change contend. One co-sponsor of the multifaceted budget amendment for the university system, Rep. Patricia Strachota (R-West Bend), said a coalition of bioscience researchers sought the liability protection. A Medical College of Wisconsin spokesman said the members of the statewide coalition addressing the issue are: BioForward, Covance, the Medical College of Wisconsin, UW Health, UW Madison, UW System, Wisconsin Alumni Association, and Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. The proposed change """"removes the cloud of criminal prosecutions"""" for bona fide researchers, said Medical College spokesman Richard Katschke. Reed says that is one cause for concern, among several. She said the federal law was not as meaningful, because local district attorneys would be more inclined to listen to complaints than federal authorities. """"That’s why we have state statutes,"""" Reed said. Reed also pointed out a potential loophole in the amendment language. While the intent of the budget amendment appeared to be to exempt only bona fide research at educational/research institutions, we found the actual language in the bill markup does not make that distinction. Strachota said legislators were planning to clean up the language to make it clear that only public educational institutions would be exempt. One more issue before we take stock. Sandgren took issue with the wording of a Humane Society e-mail alert to its supporters that said the proposed change means researchers """"can do anything without worrying about any legal protections for animals at all."""" That e-mail alert did not make it explicitly clear, Reed acknowledged, that the society was talking about state legal protections. But the news release published by the group, as well as its website, covered that point. How does it all stack up? The Wisconsin Humane Society says a proposed state statute change will exempt researchers from all the state’s criminal prohibitions against animal cruelty. There’s disagreement about the real-world impact of the change, but the exemption itself is clear. The disagreement is related to federal laws and ethical standards, which would not be affected -- and were not mentioned by the group.""",0

"The jury in Humboldt County Superior Court in Eureka, California rejected claims by Carla Allen who said that her mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, was caused by the company’s talc products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder. J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. Plaintiffs in the litigation allege that J&J knew of asbestos fibers in its cosmetic talc and concealed risks associated with the products. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company faces some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, according to an October regulatory filing. More than 9,700 of those cases involve claims over ovarian cancer, recent filings in New Jersey federal court, where most of the cases are consolidated, showed. The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J’s talc caused them to develop mesothelioma. J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it was pleased with the jury’s decision in the case of Allen. “While we deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from any form of cancer, the science and facts show that her disease was not caused by her use of our talcum-based products,” the company said. The California jury reached its decision following a roughly seven-week long jury trial, court records showed, but further details were not immediately available. Lawyers for Allen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J to date has been cleared of liability in three mesothelioma cases. It has lost two mesothelioma cases in New Jersey and California, with juries awarding a total of $142 million in damages. Both cases are under appeal. Four additional mesothelioma cases resulted in a mistrial because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died.

"Thousands of people were trapped for more than a week in submerged villages without access to clean water after Cyclone Idai smashed into the Mozambican port city of Beira on March 14, causing catastrophic flooding and killing more than 700 people across three countries in southeast Africa. With tens of thousands of displaced people moved to makeshift camps, relief efforts have increasingly focused on containing outbreaks of waterborne and infectious diseases. David Wightwick, a senior member of the WHO’s response team in Beira, told reporters that seven clinics had been set up in Mozambique to treat cholera patients and that two more would be ready soon. “We have 900,000 doses of oral cholera vaccines which are coming in on Monday, and we will start a vaccination campaign as soon as possible next week,” Wightwick said. Cholera is endemic to Mozambique, which has had regular outbreaks over the past five years. About 2,000 people were infected in the last outbreak, which ended in February 2018, according to the WHO. But the scale of the damage to Beira’s water and sanitation infrastructure, coupled with its dense population, have raised fears that another epidemic would be difficult to put down. Wightwick could not confirm whether there had yet been any deaths from cholera in Mozambique. A Reuters reporter saw the body of a dead child being brought out of an emergency clinic in Beira on Wednesday. The child had suffered acute diarrhea, which can be a symptom of cholera. In nearby Malawi, which was badly hit by flooding and heavy rains in the leadup to Cyclone Idai, the government said arable and livestock farming had been badly affected and that irrigation infrastructure had been damaged. Agriculture ministry spokesman Hamilton Chimala said around 420,000 metric tonnes of maize had been lost, representing roughly 12 percent of the country’s forecast output of 3.3 million metric tonnes in the 2018/19 farming season. Impoverished Malawi is regularly hit by food shortages, so the damage to the country’s staple grain is a cause for concern. Zimbabwe’s Local Government Minister July Moyo said on Wednesday the government would spend another $18 million to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone. As of Wednesday, 713 people in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi had died in the tropical storm and in the heavy rains before it hit.",0
"India banned the sale and import of e-cigarettes this month, warning of an “epidemic” of vaping among young people. The action has affected users nationwide and the plans of international companies including Juul Labs Inc and Philip Morris International, as well as triggering court challenges by local firms. Protesters convened on Saturday to call for vaping devices to be regulated rather than prohibited. But organizers Association of Vapers India said only about 400 people turned up across six cities, adding that some opponents of the ban feared being targeted by police. At one protest in the capital New Delhi, several people used vaping devices. Among them sat a child with a poster that read: “I don’t want my dad to be a smoker”. The government argues the ban is essential to protect people as vaping can lead to nicotine addiction and push users toward consuming tobacco. Vapers say the devices help them stay away from more harmful tobacco cigarettes. More than 900,000 people die each year due to tobacco-related illnesses in India, the government estimates. But the country has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, making it a lucrative potential market for companies selling both tobacco and vaping products. An Indian health ministry official said the government was determined to stick by its ban, despite the protests and court challenges. “There is no question of a rollback or anything like that,” the official said. Two court challenges that could be pivotal for whether the ban can continue to be enforced are under way in the eastern city of Kolkata, including one by e-cigarette importer Plume Vapour. The company, in a court filing seen by Reuters, argues that the ban will allow cigarette companies to flourish while putting e-cigarette firms out of business. New Delhi protester Aryaman Chaudhary, 25, said he stocked up on vape refills ahead of the ban, but was worried he would eventually run out. “I just want this regulated, not banned ... Everybody has an addiction.”",0
"China's first cloned pig, stuffed and displayed, is seen in front of a researcher working at the Beijing Genomics institute in Shenzhen July 23, 2010. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu The 20-odd hogs at this farm in Guangdong province in southern China are no ordinary pigs, but rather surrogate sows carrying cloned piglets. With a population projected to grow to 1.44 billion by 2030 from 1.33 billion in 2009, according to World Bank figures, Beijing is hunting for cutting-edge technology to provide better quality food. Du’s colleagues are cloning pigs at a laboratory an hour’s drive from the farm. They remove DNA from skin cells taken from the ear of a prized boar and transfer them into pig egg cells cleared of their nuclei. The resulting embryos are surgically implanted into surrogate sows. “Now we import valuable boars from Denmark and the United States. They are costly to buy, transport and susceptible to a lot of disease during transportation,” said Du, head of cloning and genetic engineering at the Beijing Genomics Institute. “With this technology, we can import small numbers of pigs and mass produce them in China.”   And international experts believe China can take a leading role in promoting the eventual acceptance of cloned animals and even transgenic — or genetically modified (GM) — produce. Ingo Potrykus, the retired, Swiss-based co-inventor of vitamin A-packed “golden rice,” said China could fill a void in securing widespread use and recognition. “To revolutionize regulation ... it needs a lead country to do so, which is politically and economically independent of the GMO-hysteria of the West,” Potrykus, whose invention has proved essential for rice-dependent countries, wrote in an e-mail. “China would have this potential and China could benefit a lot because China has a lot of food security problems ahead.”   Potrykus knows a great deal about the difficulties of winning acceptance for GM and cloned products. His variety was withheld from the market for 10 years because of regulations surrounding transgenic food. At the institute’s laboratory, another geneticist, Zhang Gengyun, is working with colleagues on flasks containing rice saplings — another Chinese staple. They want to identify gene segments in rice that are behind high yields and better root systems, so that more rice may be produced using less land and water. “Now a lot of fertilizers are used and rice cannot totally absorb them. Extra fertilizers are dumped into our water system, which damage our environment,” Zhang said. China has few conventional tools. It needs to feed 22 percent of the world’s population but has only 7 percent of the world’s arable land. Its agriculture minister said in July that China faced a formidable task in meeting demand for grains such as rice, wheat and corn over the next 10 years. Its water resources are meager — amounting to 25 percent of the per capita world average. And a quarter of its water is so polluted it is unfit even for industrial use. China’s grain harvest stood at 530 million tons of grain in 2009 and it will need to increase annual supply by 4 million tons over the next 10 years. Beijing imported U.S. corn for the first time since 2006 and is the world’s top buyer of soybeans. “In China, rice is the most important crop and it uses 50 percent of the freshwater China has each year,” Zhang said. China’s per person consumption of meat is 70 kg (155 pounds) a year, of which 54 percent is pork. That will soar with rising incomes reflecting more affluent areas like Hong Kong, where per capita meat consumption is 120 kg a year, according to Rabobank. “The government wants to secure food supply. The demand is for fresh meat,” said Jean-yves Chow, senior industry analyst at Rabobank in Hong Kong. “It doesn’t want to rely on meat imports.”   The problem is not China’s alone. Leading economist Jeffrey Sachs published articles in Nature magazine in July calling for serious preparations to feed a global population that will grow to 9.1 billion in 2050 from 6.8 billion now. “Climate change and other environmental risks, combined with a still growing population expected to reach around 9 billion by 2050 all spell serious trouble,” Sachs, head of the Earth Institute at Columbia University in New York, wrote in an email. Genetic modification technology will help, he said, but its consequences on human health and the environment must be closely monitored. The United States is a world leader in producing GM crops and the Food and Drug Adiministration has already approved the sale of food from clones and their offspring, saying the products were indistinguishable from those of non-cloned animals. It is yet to rule on whether genetically engineered fish is safe to eat. But genetic modification of food and products from cloned animals meet with resistance in Europe. In China, Du’s department has set up a unit to commercialize cloning and she expects that meat from the offspring of cloned pigs will be on the Chinese market in “a few years.”   Her department is working with China Agricultural University on more muscular and less fatty transgenic pigs — genetically modified rather than cloned — by knocking out the MSTN gene that inhibits muscle growth. “We hope to get pigs with obvious traits of good muscles and faster growth ... a lot of lean meat and less fat,” she said. Zhang’s team hopes to identify the genes they want and transfer them into target rice species in three years using conventional breeding. That, he believes, will skirt whatever fears Chinese consumers may have. “That is not genetic modification. It is conventional breeding ... within 10 years, we can have environmentally friendly species that are water and fertilizer saving,” he said. China’s Agriculture Ministry declined comment on how stringent new regulations on cloned animals or transgenic products are likely to be. It has, however, suggested an open approach in certificates issued for experimental planting of transgenic rice in recent years, according to Chinese press reports. Du said China’s State Food and Drug Administration will need to approve products derived from cloned pigs and any transgenic produce before they are allowed on the market. While experts say meat from cloned animals is no different from naturally conceived animals, Du said more safety assessments were needed for transgenic products. “Transgenic animals have potential risks. It needs a long time to evaluate before they can get into market,” she said.",0
"On 8 July 2018, social media users began sharing a report attributed to television station WLKY in Louisville, Kentucky, about a deadly viral outbreak that was supposedly ravaging the city: The university of louisville hospital has already confirmed 16 deaths within the past 8 hours from a rare strain of hr3211virus Dr hemiln head of internal medicine said this could very will be the biggest outbreak we have ever seen in the united states he warned if you have any symptoms headaches blurred vision bleaking from the ears or rectal area or ringing in your ears to go inside and stay there till medical help arrives again stay indoors do not come in contact with anyone it is known to be spread by airborne go to center for diseases control for further information and atay up to date on wlky for further details as we learn more about This deadly disiease Among the suspect features of that report were its horrendous grammar and misspellings, not to mention the fact that despite its prominent use of the WLKY logo, it was not published on WLKY‘s web site. Outbound links from the social media posts went instead to React365.com, a well-known prank web site that offers tools for users to create their own fake news articles. Within hours of the story’s dissemination, a post on the Louisville station’s Facebook page branded it a fake: PLEASE SHARE: We are aware of a false report from React365.com alleging a “deadly virus outbreak” in Louisville.

"Pets that are genetically engineered and manufactured to order may be a dream (or nightmare) of the future, but they aren’t here quite yet:  There is a website, www.genpets.com, that claims to have made genetically engineered “pets” that are part-human and part-animal and are “living, breathing” creatures. Although the web site Genpets.com puts on a good show of spoofing an outlet for the sale of “pre-packaged, bio-engineered pets,” no such product exists. One common giveaway: prospective buyers couldn’t actually order anything through the (since-removed) Genpets store, with the excuse given that “Bio-Genica is still developing its connections and relations with resellers while we get the various approvals needed to sell Genpets worldwide.”  Like similar items we’ve been asked about, Genpets are actually artworks — in this case plastic and latex sculptures (including circuitry and robotics) created in 2005 by then 24-year-old Canadian commercial artist Adam Brandejs. As the artist explained in conjunction with an exhibition of his work, the point of Genpets is to get the public thinking about the concept of bioengineering and how they feel about where that science might lead us:  I’m not against bioengineering, I’m simply hesitant towards where and how and by whom the technology will be used. That’s what this art sums up. I don’t ever want to be confused for as a crazy activist, nor do I want to appear as endorsing this technology. Bioengineering could lead to medical breakthroughs that save lives, but will it? This is more a critique of corporate ethics than of technological ethics. If you’re still caught up on whether they’re real or not, that’s ok, a lot of people are, but that’s not the point of the work. Slow down, stop, and think. Think about why it is that you probably, like most people seeing the work, find it highly disturbing on some level, and yet, still want to buy one. Why is it that you’re so inclined to buy things, no matter what? And what is it that makes this concept so disturbing, or not disturbing to you? Consider both sides of the issue, and consider how we treat animals in farms, and pet stores today. How does that relate? This sculpture is the physical representation of a question. Bioengineering, like any new technology promises a great deal of positive effects. We as a race however tend to put a great deal more faith into technology as a saviour than it necessarily has earned. Through Genpets I question the negative effect that bioengineering can have, for we all know that when it all comes down to it, profit is the bottom line. The question surrounding bioengineering is not in its positive or negative ramifications, or where it can take us; it is whether or not we are responsible enough to go there. When Genpets were exhibited in a Toronto storefront, they created a reaction much like the one now being prompted by the Genpets.com web site:  Genpets seems to create a reaction wherever they go. While in the store window of Iodine Toronto, the shop owner began sleeping in the store as many nights, people would bang at the windows furiously. Some in protest of the small Bio-genetically engineered creatures trapped in plastic, some wanting to wake them up or buy them. Hordes of teens wanting a bioengineered pet met confused, baffled, or even shocked looks from parents. For an upcoming generation, through our own marketing techniques, life and the idea of life are quickly becoming viewed as disposable commodities. Adam Brandejs’ other works include the animatronic flesh shoe and a prosthetic zipper.",1
"On 23 August 2017, the American Badass Facebook page posted a widely-shared message about Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell: This is Isaiah Crowell! He plays for the Cleveland Browns and this is the picture he posted on Instagram! As long as he is allowed to remain in the NFL I will not watch or attend another game! He is a piece of dog shit! The post was accompanied by a photograph of Crowell and a screenshot of an artist’s rendering of a hooded man cutting the throat of a police officer. We received several enquiries from readers wanting to know whether Crowell did, in fact, post this image to his Instagram account. He did, on 6 July 2016. He deleted the image after a few minutes and later apologized repeatedly, to the satisfaction of local police. There has been a certain amount of skepticism on social media about the story because the post is no longer on Crowell’s Instagram feed — but that’s because it was removed, not because it was never there. However, many took screenshots of the image, which Cromwell posted with the brief message: “They give polices [sic] all types of weapons and they continuously choose to kill us. #Weak.” On 11 July 2016, Crowell released the following apology via the Cleveland Browns and on his own Twitter account, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. He explained that in the days leading up to the post, he had been emotional about the deaths of two black men: Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota. Crowell posted the image before five police officers were shot dead in Dallas, Texas, not afterwards. Last week was an emotional and difficult week as we saw extreme acts of violence against black men across our country as well as against police officers in Dallas. I posted an image to Instagram in the midst of that emotion that I shouldn’t have and immediately removed it. It was an extremely poor decision and I apologize for that mistake and for offending people. My values and beliefs do not match that image. I am outraged and upset by the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile along with so many others. I am also outraged and saddened by the attacks in Dallas and the deaths of the five honorable police officers (Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Michael J. Smith, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa) who were providing protection while trying to keep peace. We have to be better as a society, it’s not about color, it’s about what’s right and wrong. I was very wrong in posting that image. Every single life matters, every death as a result of violence should be treated with equal outrage and penalty. As of 24 August 2017, the apology is no longer on Crowell’s Twitter account or on Cleveland Browns web site. We asked the club why the apology appears to have been removed, but did not receive a response in time for publication. According to the Plain Dealer, Crowell also posted a video apology to his Facebook account on 13 July 2016 — which has also since been removed. However, the video is available on YouTube, where the Baby Baby account uploaded it on 13 July 2016:  Crowell again cited his frustration and upset at police violence against black men, and again apologized for posting the image. …I knew I was wrong. I’m sorry, and I hope you will understand that is not who I am. I would never wish violence on anyone, especially a police officer. Crowell also pledged to donate his first game check of the season ($35,294, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer) to the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation. We asked the Cleveland Browns why this apology video is no longer viewable on Isaiah Crowell’s Facebook page, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. The next day, Crowell personally apologized to Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams, who told the press that the running back had been “contrite” and “apologetic.” He wanted to personally apologize to myself and law enforcement here in northeast Ohio. A young man, in the heat of the moment, made a bad choice, made a bad decision and he’s apologizing for that. The Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association (CPPA) rejected Crowell’s first apology and threatened to refuse to provide security at home games unless Crowell made a “grand gesture” of contrition. However, after Crowell’s follow-up video message and pledged donation, the CPPA accepted his apology. CPPA President Stephen Loomis said the group “appreciated” the running back’s video statement and that he had “made things right.” I appreciate the apology and we accept it. People are allowed to make mistakes in life. Our problem was that first apology. It wasn’t sincere. But Isaiah stepped up to the plate to make a personal apology, and we definitely appreciate his donation to the Fallen Officers Foundation. I’d love to work with Isaiah in the future. How cool would it be if Isaiah and I attended community events together to really make a difference in the city? We are missing opportunities that we should be seizing as law enforcement and athletes in the city. I’m glad we didn’t have to go the route of boycotting Browns games. We would not have enjoyed that. We wanted to give Isaiah the opportunity to make things right, and he did. It’s not entirely clear why this episode has been given renewed attention more than a year later, but it could be related to the start of a new NFL season, as well as particular focus on the Cleveland Browns, amid an ongoing controversy over the national anthem.",0
"False reports of a 7-year0ld girl who got breast implants can be traced back to a well-known fake news website. The story appeared at World News Daily report under the headline, “7-year-old Girl Receives Breast Implants for Christmas,” in early February 2017. The report claims that a woman named Dana Mason took her 7-year-old daughter, Juliet, to China have the breast implant procedure done: They left for China on December 22, and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic, the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup, and her mother says she’s “extremely happy about her about her new breasts”. The story was widely shared on social media and re-reported by other fake news outlets (in one version Juliet was supposedly 8-yeas-old when she got breast implants). Many people reacted to the story without checking its source, which its disclaimer clearly states is a fake news website that “assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.” The rouse about the 7-year-old girl wasn’t a new one, either. In 2014, well-known fake news website Empire News reported that a 10-year-old girl had traveled to Mexico to receive breast implants. That report was also fake. In 1998, there was a factual report published by the U.K.’s Independent newspaper about a 12-year-old girl receiving breast implants. But the procedure was scheduled to correct a deformity in the girl’s chest that had caused her a lot of distress, her surgeon said: “One breast has not developed. On one side she has an A cup and on the other a D cup. She has a problem that she is very upset about,” said Douglas McGeorge, who works for both the public and private sector. “She won’t go out. She won’t go into changing rooms at school. She won’t do sport. She won’t undress in front of friends. Another U.K. family drew scrutiny in 2001 when they made plans for their 16-year-old daughter to get breast implants for a birthday present, the Guardian reports: Jenna, of Warsop Vale, near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, said she had been thinking about breast enlargement since she was 12. She insisted yesterday: “You’ve got to have breasts to be successful. “Every other person you see on television has had implants. I used to pray that my boobs would grow. Then I just thought, what’s the point when I can have implants when I want?” She will be 16 in August. “I just want to be happy with my body and I think having my breasts enlarged will give me more self-confidence.” Her father Martin said he and his wife had been in the plastic surgery industry for a number of years, “so all our children have grown up with plastic surgery. They don’t see anything wrong with it and neither do we”. So, over the last 20 years, stories about children getting breast implants have generated plenty of controversy and attention. That’s probably why clickbait and fake news websites have used false reports like the one about a 7-year-old girl getting breast implants to generate traffic. Comments",1
"While the article did not specifically state how much it costs to do a 12 minute yoga session everyday, one can assume it is relatively inexpensive and cost is not really an issue here. Where it becomes an issue is when yoga practitioners attend expensive classes, feel compelled to buy expensive yoga accessories, travel to India to spend time with yoga gurus, and generally spend lots of personal time practicing it, all which could lead to considerable costs. The story notes, “The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.” [emphasis ours] What exactly does that mean? How much did bone density improve? Did all 227 subjects see improvement or was the improvement seen in aggregate? There is a big difference between the two and the common take away would be that all saw improvements, which is far from the reality. We also would like to know why only 227 out of 741 original enrollees are reported on. How many of the remaining 500+ participants dropped out? Research study dropout is an important factor as it gives us some idea of the tolerability or acceptability of the ‘treatment.’ The story provides insight into the downsides of bisphosphonate therapy but says nothing about the potential dangers of yoga. It is true that, done correctly, yoga is not likely to produce significant injuries. However, the subjects in the study were not supervised nor was their positioning for each of the poses determined. Incorrect alignment can cause joint strain and joint and injury. In fact, the Times itself has previously reported that yoga can wreck your body! Appropriate caveats about the lack of control group and the fact the study was among self-selected volunteers (perhaps a hint of ‘healthy-people bias’) were helpful. Other limitations of the research, such as the dependence on self-reporting of the participants’ daily yoga practice (people often either forget or give socially appropriate responses in surveys) could have been discussed. No evident disease mongering in this story, except to say that osteoporosis and it’s precursor osteopenia are often heavily mongered diseases simply because bone density is one of many risk factors for hip fractures (that is treatable with drugs) but it is not the most important one. In fact, some argue that bone density is such a low predictor for hip fractures it is worthless as a measure of bone health and simply shouldn’t be employed. Dr. Fishman invested a ‘significant chunk’ of his own money into the research and we appreciate that the story put that financial interest out in the open. Apart from the selling of the DVDs used, it hard to imagine how there could be a significant financial gain from the study. However, given that investment, it wold have been valuable to have comments from others in the field speaking to the study results and the basic premise entailed. This kind of research might be more influenced by more subtle intellectual conflicts of interest, where the researchers are intellectually identified with an idea (yoga=good) and would have difficulty accepting alternative hypotheses. The lack of a control group becomes somewhat problematic as it is possible that a similar group of non-yoga performing people would also see increases in their bone density. The article mentions the tolerability of osteoporosis drugs, though the study wasn’t a comparison between the two. While the study didn’t examine this, comparing yoga’s effects against alternative weight-bearing exercise forms (running, walking) might merit a mention. Yoga is everywhere (the phrase ’12 important yoga poses’ gives 6.2 million hits on google). The report doesn’t make any claims for novelty where none exists. The overall benefits of yoga are fairly well-established, even if those benefits may not be strictly ‘evidence-based’. What is ‘new’ is the research trying to demonstrate effects of yoga on a single parameter (bone density) and we think the researchers should be lauded for trying to apply some rigor to answering these kinds of specific questions. There is no evidence of reliance on a news release",0
"There is no mention of the costs for the compounds referred to in this release. Nor are the compounds themselves identified which might give some idea of the cost of acquiring them. The release suggests an over-the-counter drug was being developed but no information was provided on what the cost might be to patients. Given that this is pre-clinical research, we have no idea about what the process of isolating the active compounds would be, which would impact cost. The release states that, “compounds in thyme and oregano have demonstrated a greater than 37 percent increase in exercise tolerance and a 15 percent increase in muscle mass of certain body muscles.”  But there is no information as to how these measurements were acquired, or to which of the “certain body muscles” they were referring. And again, there is no mention of what these compounds actually were. Simply throwing out some percentages without providing an adequate context isn’t helpful for readers. If the release had transparently claimed that the benefits listed above applied to the “sedentary mice” finally mentioned at the end of the release, we’d still rate this criteria as Not Satisfactory. The mice were not noted to have cancer, COPD, heart failure, and other conditions which brought about wasting sickness. The findings, as such, are specific to non-human species without any of the conditions that are purported to be creating the setting for wasting. There is no mention of harms from these mysterious, unnamed compounds. And without their identification, readers are left clueless about any risks that might be involved. The inference is that since oregano and thyme are common, edible spices that they would present no harms once prepared in over-the counter products. Where to begin? The cardinal error in this release lies with the fact that it isn’t until the sixth paragraph out of eight paragraphs that we learn the research was done in mice, not humans. The first two paragraphs of the release refer to cachexia, a condition in humans, suggesting to readers that this is what the research was about. The release also says that the experiments were done in “sedentary mice” which may or may not have been an adequate and appropriate animal model for studying this human illness. Readers have no way of knowing, based on the information in the release. Additionally, there is no information in the release revealing where — or if — it was published in a peer-reviewed journal, or presented at a scientific meeting, two standard ways that research institutions insure readers that the science is above board and open to scrutiny. (An email to the media relations staff confirmed that the study hasn’t been published and they declined to provide any further information about the study.) The quoted source in the story, one of the researchers, claims the “discovery was a serendipitous finding,” which raises a red flag, suggesting it might be merely an observation and not a conclusion based on experiments. The researchers do offer a theory as to how this alleged anti-cachexia effect might work, but that’s really just conjecture at this point. We’ll give the release the benefit of the doubt in this category. Cachexia often accompanies serious diseases — including cancer — and effective treatments are needed. But suggesting that an over-the-counter drug, based on commonly used spices tested only in mice, might alleviate this challenging condition seems to be misleading readers hoping for simple answers. There is no mention in the release of who funded this research, nor is there a journal paper which we could find that might offer that information. The release does say that the “discovery” has been licensed to a pharmaceutical firm that plans on developing an over-the-counter drug, and quotes a company official praising the work. There is no information that suggests the researchers are free from any potential conflicts of interest, with that company or other firms. A search of the Google Patents database shows that the lead investigator and the University of Iowa Research Foundation have applied for a patent for the compound. The final paragraph of the release states that, “The treatment of cachexia just doesn’t exist,” but that’s not the case. The medication megase is used in HIV related wasting and it’s often offered to cancer patients as well. Some other interventions used to reduce the effects of cachexia include resistance exercise and a high-protein diet. Psychological interventions are often used, as are other approaches which are aimed at both the cachexia and the underlying disease which causes it. We’ll give the release a Satisfactory in this category since it states that a company has been licensed to develop a drug based on this research, and therefore readers know that it isn’t available yet. If combating cachexia were as simple as using compounds from ordinary spices, then this would be adequately novel. But neither the release nor the research as yet are available tend to bear that out. The work is done in animals, not humans. The compounds are not identified. And the explanation of benefits from those compounds is inadequate for readers to have confidence in these claims. The release uses the word “cure” in the headline, which is unjustified.",1
"The Federal Trade Commission won agreements from L’Occitane, Inc.; Sensa Products LLC; HCG Diet Direct LLC; and LeanSpa LLC. The settlements required them to drop unsubstantiated claims from their ads and, in some cases, return money to consumers. The FTC also urged media outlets to scrutinize advertisements more carefully to avoid publishing potentially misleading ads, noting that some of the advertisements for the products - from food supplements to skin creams - appeared in mainstream publications. The commission provided guidance for publishers and broadcasters on how to screen weight-loss claims in advertisements. The FTC’s action, codenamed “Operation Failed Resolution,” was timed to coincide with the vows to lose weight so often made, and quickly abandoned, in January. Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, warned that the only slim element of the products is their chance of success. “Resolutions to lose weight are easy to make but hard to keep. And the chances of being successful just by sprinkling something on your food, rubbing cream on your thighs, or using a supplement are slim to none,” Rich said. One agreement was with Sensa, which said that its powder sprinkled on food would cause weight loss and peddled it on television infomercials, magazine advertisements and online ads. The company said the powder “is clinically proven to cause substantial weight loss without dieting or exercise, averaging 30 pounds in six months,” the FTC said in a court filing. In contrast, a study of the product by a Sensa company executive found that users lost an average of 5.6 pounds over six months, the FTC said in its court filing. A one-month supply of Sensa’s powder cost $59.00, plus shipping and handling, the FTC said. Sensa agreed to return $26.5 million to consumers, the commission said. Sensa said in a statement that the company had admitted no wrongdoing and that the FTC did not challenge the product’s safety. “Sensa is incorporating changes to its advertising to comply with the FTC’s consent order and continues to support the brand with new advertising and marketing materials,” the company said. In a separate court filing, the FTC said L’Occitane sold two skin creams that promised “clinically proven slimming effectiveness” and would “visibly reduce the appearance of cellulite.” L’Occitane agreed to pay $450,000 to reimburse customers. There was no evidence that the cream slimmed thighs or reduced cellulite, the FTC said. L’Occitane said it had cooperated fully with the commission, and had implemented “even more rigorous policies and procedures that will guide future clinical testing and ensure that our marketing and advertising comply with FTC regulations and guidelines.”  A third company, HCG Diet Direct, sold liquid drops that it said contained a hormone produced by human placenta that would help people lose weight. Under a settlement, the company agreed to an order requiring it to pay $3.2 million. The judgment was suspended because the company could not pay it. The FTC also reached a settlement with LeanSpa, which had used fake news websites to advertise the acai berry as a weight-loss miracle product until the company was shut down by the FTC and Connecticut attorney general’s office in 2011. Boris Mizhen, a LeanSpa executive, will surrender $7 million in cash and property while his wife, who did not participate in the scheme, will surrender $300,000. Attempts to reach the other two companies by telephone, email or by Twitter were not successful.",0
"""San Antonio’s growth was coupled with an eye-popping statistic during the latest Texas Tribune Festival public policy conference. Robert Puente, CEO of the San Antonio Water System, said during a Sept. 20, 2013, panel discussion that the city-owned utility has seen """"67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used."""" San Antonio has been called a """"poster child"""" for water conservation. As it has risen to become the seventh-largest city in the United States, its leadership has used multiple approaches to tackle the water worries facing all of Texas, where the population is rocketing and the future looks dry. But did 67 percent more customers settle in without using more water? By phone, Puente said the percentages he aired """"need to be updated."""" The water system’s vice president for public affairs, Greg Flores, told us by email that Puente’s rates covered 1984 through 2009. During that period, according to a chart Flores sent us, the population served by the utility rose from 800,627 to 1.34 million while water produced fell from 191,431 acre-feet to 186,112 acre-feet (an acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre to a depth of 1 foot, equal to 325,851 gallons). That’s a nearly 68 percent increase in population served and a 2.9 percent decrease in water produced. Then again, the cited period wasn’t the latest 25-year time span when Puente spoke. Flores said the chart was generated from the utility’s 2008 statistics. Flores sent a web link to the most recent edition, the utility’s """"2011 Stat Book,"""" and gave us the numbers for 2012, which we used to check the six most recent 25-year spans for which data is available. The 2012 data was not available when Puente spoke at the conference, Flores said, though data through 2011 was. """"Compilation of data for a particular year is typically not completed until the end of the following year,"""" he said. The 25-year spans showed fluctuations partly explained by the weather: Flores noted that 2011 was """"the single hottest, driest year in Texas"""" and said water use remained atypically high through the 2011-13 drought. 2007 was a very wet year for San Antonio, he said. 25-year span Population served Acre-feet used 1987-2012* Up 55.2% Up 23.4% 1986-2011 Up 51.8% Up 21% 1985-2010 Up 55.6% Up 5% 1984-2009 Up 57.6% Down 0.6% 1983-2008 Up 59.9% Up 21.5% 1982-2007 Up 69.1% Down 7.3% *2012 data were unavailable when Puente made his claim. The oldest span we checked, 1982-2007, showed more dramatic change than Puente’s statement: 69 percent growth and a 7 percent drop in water use. But the most recent span for which data was available when he spoke, 1986-2011, saw a 52 percent increase in customers alongside a 21 percent increase in water used. That’s still not bad, a long-time Sierra Club leader told us by phone. Ken Kramer, water resources chairman for Sierra’s Texas chapter, told us, """"It’s still very significant. Especially as compared to other major cities around the state. … It is great that San Antonio is doing this, and it does provide a model for other cities that haven’t had that success yet."""" The trend statewide is toward less water use, Kramer said. State and federal standards, with such requirements as water-efficient showerheads and toilets, have reduced Texans’ per-person water use. Texas as a whole averaged out to about 151 gallons used per person per day in 2007-11, according to the Texas Water Development Board, with the state’s nearly 26 million people using 169 gallons apiece a day during hot, dry 2011. Flores said, and the utility’s stats confirm, that San Antonians reduced per-person water use from around 200 gallons a day in the 1980s (the utility’s stats show the decade averaged out at 197 gallons per day, to be precise) to about 140 gallons a day now (2007-11 average out at 137 gallons per day). Daily water use per capita for 2011 in Texas’ six largest cities shook out this way, according to the water board: Houston, 191 gallons; San Antonio, 148 gallons; Dallas, 197 gallons; Austin, 156 gallons; Fort Worth, 166 gallons; El Paso, 143 gallons. What got San Antonio saving? """"A big federal hammer,"""" Puente told us. """"Back in the early 1990s, a federal judge actually was going to lay down pumping rules, limit our ability to pump water out of our aquifer, and gave us till the end of the legislative session to pass certain rules that we would impose on ourselves,"""" he said. San Antonio and nearby areas, he said, were hit by the federal deadline because of endangered species that relied on the Edwards Aquifer. Flores outlined some of the Alamo City’s approaches: Smarter use of water pulled from the Edwards, including the nation’s largest direct recycled water delivery system, routing treated wastewater to users such as golf courses, the River Walk and local industry. Pumping all the Edwards water it’s allowed to every year, and storing what it doesn’t use in the Carrizo Aquifer -- which isn’t porous like the Edwards, but hard-packed sand, Flores said. The Edwards water sits there, in fact barely commingling with the Carrizo water, and San Antonio has been extracting it as needed for the past three years. New sources such as a $145 million desalination plant set to start tapping a deeper, saltwater aquifer in 2016. Not pumping as much water in the first place, aka conservation. The water utility educates users and subsidizes ways to use less, both in residential and commercial systems. Flores said the utility has approved conservation projects based on the $400 price to buy rights to an acre-foot of Edwards water for a year. If the project was cheaper than buying the water, the utility implemented the plan. Giving away 325,000 low-flow toilets, even hiring plumbers to help low-income residents install them, cost less than the unsaved water would have, Flores said. Same for helping Coca-Cola retool to clean bottles with pressurized air. Last year, though, mindful of the rising cost of water from the Edwards and other sources, the utility raised the ceiling: Now a project has to save more than buying the water at $1,100 per acre-foot, he said. Outdoor water usage, Puente said, is the next area of focus, with the utility offering rebates to water customers who want to convert a parched part of their lawn to a deck or patio. Our ruling Puente said San Antonio has seen """"67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used."""" Those are cherry-picked, out-of-date stats, vintage 1984-2009. Up-to-date figures available when Puente spoke, covering 1986-2011, show that as the population served grew 52 percent, water usage increased 21 percent. San Antonio may outpace other cities in water conservation. This claim still washes out as . – The statement is not accurate.""",1
"""The story focus is the increased cost of 2nd or 3rd-line chemotherapy drugs aimed at advanced cancer. The story notes that patients are often forced to choose between these treatments and their financial savings. The story appropriately notes that cost should be discussed as an additional side effect of treatment. The story notes via an American Cancer Society rep that it """"costs a billion dollars"""" to bring a drug to market; however, we are not told of the typical profit made from these drugs once they are available to patients. A terrific book by Merrill Goozner, """"The $800 Million Pill,"""" also pokes holes in the claim of that much in drug R&D. This is an oversight in reporting about cost. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt. The story only discussed costs and side effects. Why were data on benefits left out? The story does not discuss how these newer drugs work or how much quantity and quality they add to patients’ lives. The story does not discuss if newer drugs add months or years to patients lives and if they are any better than older drugs for treating cancer. We are told that some drugs have fewer or different side effects. The story discusses the side effects of certain chemotherapy drugs. While the story is about chemotherapy in general, there was a nice example near the end about a newer regimen that is far more expensive but associated with fewer side effects. The story focuses on the burden of cost, which oncologists have begun to consider with patients as another downside or side effect of chemotherapy regimens. The story notes that there are now guidelines for discussing and planning for the cost of treatment with patients. The story focuses on cost of cancer treatments and provides price estimates for certain chemotherapy drugs. The story does not do a good job explaining how these drugs  treat cancer or extend a patient’s life. The story notes that patients should weigh the benefits of these drugs, but they do not explicitly discuss what this means. The story provides some qualitiative evidence via family stories that these drugs are cost-prohibitive for many patients. It is not necessarily helpful to discuss costs without discussing benefits in absolute terms. The story didn’t give us that evidence. Cancer is of course a prevalent disease; this piece did not hype that fact. The story discusses the small number of people who would be eligible for newly approved and/or experimental drugs to treat advanced cancer. The story includes perspectives from families, patients and oncologists who discuss weighing the benefits of newer chemotherapy drugs with the increased cost. It would have been useful to interview a pharmaceutical manufacturer for a quote on the typical profit of chemotherapy drugs  after recouping money for the development of these drugs. The story provides information on alternative older drugs that may be an option for cancer treatment. The story notes that the tradeoff may be the type of side effects. The story also provides some resources for patients who may qualify for free or reduced-cost medicines. The story focuses on newer chemotherapy regimens that may be unavailable to some people as they are too expensive. The story explains that because the market for chemo certain drugs is small and focused, the cost of the drugs is higher. The story also notes that some patients may qualify for need-based help via hospital and drug-company sponsored assistance. The story discusses newer chemotherapy drugs and the consistent increase in cost–about 15 percent a year. The story contains a great deal of independent reporting and information does not appear to be taken from a press release.""",0
"The story reports that the existing version of this test costs over $4,000. It puts this cost in context by reporting that one of the researchers says some women could still save money if the test results prompt them to skip radiation therapy that can cost more than $21,000 (as well as exposing them to some risks and harms). The story comes very close to meeting this criterion. It reports that this new test put 75 percent of women with this type of breast tumor into a low-risk category and that this information could support a decision to skip radiation therapy… and that the predictions are more accurate than what clinicians usually rely on today. It also notes that for this type of tumor (ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS), radiation therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of a recurrence in the same breast, though it does not alter survival rates, thus adding valuable context to the decision that this new test is supposed to help women make. However, this story fails to alert readers to a central point: the study did not examine whether this test actually improves outcomes for the patients. In other words, while the researchers can say women with certain test results are less likely to have another DCIS in the same breast, further trials would be needed to determine whether or not changing treatment based on the test results improves the outcomes the women care about, including reserving radiation therapy for those women most likely to benefit. The story does include a comment from an independent expert who says more study is needed before making changes in usual treatment recommendations; but the story would have been even better if it had plainly and prominently stated that this study did not look at whether making treatment decisions based on the results of the new test makes a difference in the long-term health outcomes of women with this sort of DCIS. Although the overall tone of the story presents this test as a clear advance in providing treatment guidance to women with DCIS, it does spell out that 5 percent of women classified by the test as “low-risk” still developed an invasive cancer within 10 years… and that over 80 percent of women labeled as “high-risk” did not develop an invasive breast cancer within 10 years. So readers are told that even with this test, physicians cannot predict the future with certainty. Overall, the story does a good job of describing the study and putting the results in context. But as noted above, it fails to clearly alert readers to the fact that this study did not look at the effect of changing treatment recommendations based on the test results. Many readers may believe the study accomplished more than it actually did. Also, this study was presented at a medical meeting. We like to see stories point out that meeting presentations are not subject to the same level of peer review as articles published in leading medical journals. The story states near the top that this test is intended for the 45,000 women in the United States who are diagnosed each year with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in one of their breasts. The story includes two independent experts who help put the study results in context. It also identifies one source (Shak) as an employee of the company that sells an earlier version of the test. The story would have been better if it had addressed the relationship between the lead researcher and the company, but since it appears (based on other reports) that Dr. Solin did not disclose any conflicts of interest, we will give the story a satisfactory rating on this criterion. The story lays out the conundrum facing women diagnosed with DCIS: that clinicians generally can’t predict which women will ultimately develop invasive disease and which ones will be fine even with little or no treatment. As the story reports, these women and their physicians may decide to opt for conservative treatment, but that many choose to undergo radiation therapy in hopes of reducing the risk of a recurrence. Overall, the story describes this new test as being able to narrow the uncertainty somewhat. The story reports that an earlier version of this test is already on the market and that the company plans to make the new version available within weeks. Since it appears that updating the way this test is used does not require regulatory approval, it seems adequate to rely on the company’s statement about its marketing plans. As mentioned above, the story describes this new test as a refinement of an existing test. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.",0
"""Opponents of Ohio's estate tax say it hurts the state by driving away wealthy residents. State Rep. Jay Hottinger, a leader of the drive to repeal the tax in the General Assembly, said a """"shockingly high number"""" of Ohioans leave because of the tax. But, the Newark Republican acknowledged on the """"Sound of Ideas"""" on WCPN 90.3 FM there is no actual number to cite. """"When an individual decides to leave my home community in Licking County, believe it or not, they don't take out a press release,"""" he said. """"They don't send it to the news media and say, 'We're leaving the state of Ohio because we want to preserve our assets for our heirs."""" He pointed to individuals instead, naming the founder of Wendy's restaurants as one example. """"Dave Thomas left the state literally on his deathbed to avoid the estate tax,"""" Hottinger said. PolitiFact Ohio was stirred. We imagined a dramatic dash for the border in a souped-up medical van. Wanting to know more, we called Hottinger's office for details. When they didn't get back to us, we searched on our own. We found a less dramatic story. Thomas died in 2002, after a decade-long battle with liver cancer, at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He had lived there since 1982, when he moved to Florida after retiring as CEO of Wendy’s at age 49. Prior to that, he had lived in Ohio for 20 years. If his primary goal at that time of his move was to limit the tax exposure his estate would have after his death, he must have been pleasantly surprised to discover that he also gained the year-round ability to play golf (which he loved) and to cruise on his 90-foot yacht, the I. Lorraine (named for his wife), which he was able to dock behind his home. A generous philanthropist, particularly in the interests of children's welfare, medicine and education, Thomas supported (and established) a number of organizations and causes in Florida, as he continued to do in Ohio and elsewhere. He said his greatest regret was not finishing high school, and in 1993 he hired a tutor and passed the G.E.D. exam. Coconut Creek High School in Fort Lauderdale made him part of its senior class, and awarded his high school diploma. He and his wife were king and queen of the senior prom, and Thomas was voted """"Most Likely to Succeed."""" Legal residency is not something that can be established by deathbed conversion. Nor is it determined solely by physical presence. The point is that Thomas, an adoptee who was born in New Jersey and moved constantly as a boy, spending significant periods in Michigan, Tennessee and Indiana, was no mere Florida visitor or latecomer. Though he still had Ohio homes at Buckeye Lake and in the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington, he registered to vote in Florida, not as an absentee in Ohio, in 1988. There’s also evidence that Thomas (who was survived by his wife, five children and 16 grandchildren) knew a thing or two about taxes, making us doubt that he would have left tax and estate planning to the eleventh hour. Gov. Bob Taft credited his support for getting passage of a $500 adoption credit on Ohio income taxes in 1999, and President Clinton gave him credit in 1996 for a federal law giving parents a one-time tax credit of $5,000 when they adopt a child. There are other reasons to be skeptical of the claim about Thomas. In examining claims about estate taxes elsewhere, PolitiFact Rhode Island found research reporting that estate taxes have little or no impact on the flow of people from one state to another. The National Tax Journal in 2006 published """"State ‘Death’ Taxes and Elderly Migration -- The Chicken or the Egg?,"""" whose authors found no evidence that the elderly were responding to changes in estate taxes. Kail Padquitt, staff economist for The Tax Foundation, a think tank that studies federal and state tax policies, told PolitiFact he hasn’t seen any proof that the prospect of paying estate taxes drives people to move. And if all this wasn’t enough, there’s another key fact to consider. Hottinger’s claim was that Thomas fled the state """"literally on his death bed, to avoid estate tax."""" That clearly isn’t the case, unless he lingered 20 years before passing. And at that, it would have been three years too soon. Until 2005 (three years after Thomas’ death), Florida also had an estate tax. Hottinger’s statement isn’t just inaccurate, it’s also ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, it’s worthy of flame broiling.""",1
"""Every year, millions of average Americans legally buy guns in this country. But have thousands of people on the FBI’s Terrorist Watch List also legally purchased guns, and other weapons, on U.S. soil? That’s the claim Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, made following the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Thompson and others in Congress called for a ban on weapons purchases by anyone on the watch list. The U.S. Senate struck down a bill that sought to accomplish that earlier this month. """"Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States,"""" Thompson said on floor of the House of Representatives on Dec. 7, urging passage of the bill. Was this true? We decided to fact-check the eye-opening statement. But first, we wanted to learn more about the list itself. The list, which includes the smaller No Fly List, is a database comprising information about """"those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity,"""" according to the FBI. National security officials consider it a key tool in preventing future attacks. Civil liberty groups and some elected leaders have called it unconstitutional, citing a lack of due process and vague standards for inclusion on the list. It’s caused headaches at airport security checkpoints for people with similar names to those on the list, including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Elk Grove. The database is believed to include hundreds of thousands of individuals, including roughly 10,000 Americans. But being on the list as a """"suspected terrorist"""" does not mean the person has a criminal record, or has ever been charged with a crime. It just means they’re """"reasonably suspected"""" by a federal official of being involved in terrorist activity. Our Research We know it’s legal for suspected terrorists to buy weapons — specifically, guns — because that’s the right Thompson and even President Obama have said they want to take away. But how are purchases by suspected terrorists tracked? And how can anyone know for certain that """"more than 2,000"""" have legally bought weapons over the past decade in the U.S.? Enter the FBI. The federal agency conducts instant criminal background checks on people seeking to buy firearms at licensed gun stores. In 2004, these checks began examining whether an applicant was on the terrorist watch list. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio In March, the U.S. Government Accountability Office published an analysis of FBI data showing that from February 2004 through December 2014, 2,043 out of 2,233 weapons applications by people on the terrorist watch list were allowed to proceed. Nearly all applications were for firearms. Three were for explosives, all of which were approved. When we contacted Thompson’s office, a staffer pointed us to the GAO analysis to back up the congressman’s claim. The GAO found an average of about 200 successful weapons purchases by the group of people on the list, each year, during the timeframe. Experts we spoke with told us there’s no way of independently verifying information on the list, as it’s not public. They referred to the GAO analysis as the best estimate available. """"I have no means of independently confirming who is a reasonable suspect even if I knew the names. I imagine this is true of most average persons. We have to go on trust,"""" Martha Crenshaw, Stanford University political science professor and expert on terrorism, said in an email. The FBI has declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000. A 'plausible number' Two experts who helped oversee the watch list told us the congressman’s claim of """"more than 2,000"""" suspected terrorists legally buying weapons over 10 years is realistic. """"That’s certainly a plausible number,"""" said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. The screening center maintains the watch list. Reardon, who now works for an intelligence consulting firm, estimated the number of Americans on it is currently no more than 10,000. Another expert knowledgeable about the list agreed. """"Two thousand, over such a long period of time -- 10 years -- does not actually strike me as being overly large because there are a lot of people in this country that are purchasing firearms,"""" said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. """"So it’s not surprising that there’s been a fairly substantial number of encounters with people who are on that terrorist watch list for one reason or another, over the past decade."""" The data show weapons applications, not the number of individuals making those requests. So presumably, the same person could have made multiple applications. Even so, the experts said, the number cited by Thompson could be much higher. Suspected terrorists could have legally bought weapons at gun shows, where transactions are not subject to federal background checks. Faulty list? While there’s data to back up Thompson’s claim, it’s also important to consider the accuracy of the names on the terror watch list. How do we know, for example, that the people on the list really are """"suspected terrorists?"""" In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General released an audit  that found that 35 percent of the identities on the watch list at the time were """"associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorism or domestic terrorism designations."""" Many of the records were for people who had originally """"been appropriately watchlisted but should have been removed from the watchlist after the case had been closed,"""" the audit said. The American Civil Liberties Union has repeatedly criticized what it calls the """"unconstitutionally vague"""" standards for inclusion on the terror watch list. It repeated a call earlier this month for major reforms of the database. Edgar and Reardon both acknowledged the list is """"not perfect."""" Edgar added, however, that many of the early problems with the list, which caused some people with the same name as a suspected terrorist to be stopped at airports, have been resolved. Even if a large chunk of the names on the list are outdated, we presume a majority truly are """"suspected terrorists,"""" based on our research and that of the experts we spoke with. Our Ruling Rep. Mike Thompson said recently on the House floor that: """"Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the U.S."""" He backed up his claim with FBI data that show 2,043 people on the agency’s terror watch list successfully applied for weapons at licensed gun shops over the past decade. There’s no way to track how many people on the list legally bought weapons at gun shows, as those transactions aren’t subject to federal background checks. But it makes sense to assume some did. The congressman left out the fact that a federal audit in 2009 found 35 percent of the identities on the list had no ties to current terrorism cases. The audit said many of the names remained on the list when they should have been removed. But given the large size of the terror watch list — with perhaps 10,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners — it’s reasonable to assume that 200 or more on the list made legal weapons purchases each year over the past decade. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.""",0
"On 26 February 2019, an Idaho couple shared a cautionary tale on Facebook that had garnered over one million shares by the time of this reporting. The post detailed a strange mark on their son’s face and the ultimate diagnosis of a form of strep throat that infects the sinuses:  It is true that a form of strep throat is capable of infecting the nasal passage, sinuses, face, and even other organs. Clinically known as invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease, or iGAS, it occurs when the bacteria responsible for common strep throat infect other organ systems or the bloodstream, as described by the Middlesex-London Health Unit of London, Ontario, which experienced an outbreak of iGAS cases in 2017: Group A streptococcus (GAS) are common bacteria which can cause skin and throat infections, including strep throat and cellulitis … While the majority of GAS infections cause relatively mild illnesses like strep throat and impetigo, sometimes the bacteria can become invasive and can cause more serious and potentially life-threatening infections when they get into muscles, blood and other organs. Symptoms of an iGAS infection depend on the site of the infection and may include fever, chills, sore throat, dizziness, confusion, severe pain, redness or swelling around a wound or injured area. In its most severe form iGAS can result in life-threatening conditions, including necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as a “flesh-eating disease”), myositis and myonecrosis (muscle inflammation and a “muscle eating” disease, respectively) and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (StrepTSS), which can lead to total organ failure. Though it is extremely rare, when the latter occurs a person is at extreme risk and requires medical treatment immediately, as described by Canada’s Globe and Mail in response to the 2017 outbreak: “When strep A gets into tissue or bone — usually because a person has an open wound — it can turn deadly, and quickly. In a matter of hours, an infected person can go from having a mild fever to having flesh-eating bacteria spreading so relentlessly that the only way to stop the infection is by amputating limbs.” iGAS infections often occur in clusters and affect groups more likely to be immunocompromised, but more recent research suggests that adults and children of any age and in any medical condition can contract the disease. Nevertheless, severe iGAS infections remain quite rare, as described in the 2016 book Streptococcus Pyogenes: Basic Biology to Clinical Manifestations: [iGAS outbreaks] were first described in the United States and Europe during the mid- to late 1980s. Since then, reports of StrepTSS in adults and children have emerged worldwide. Most cases have occurred sporadically, though some clusters have been reported. The highest incidence of invasive streptococcal disease occurred in a small Minnesota community, where 26 cases/100,000 population were recorded. In addition, outbreaks have occurred in closed environments, such as nursing homes and hospitals. … Although many of the initial reports described StrepTSS in adults, children are also affected. In 2010, the incidence of invasive infection in children in Utah reached 14 cases/100,000 population. Thus, persons of all ages can be afflicted and, although some have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and alcoholism many have no predisposing medical condition and are not immunocompromised.",0
"That’s a question safety experts and activists are putting to regulators after the devastating fire at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) refinery in June, worried more disasters are waiting to happen in an industry reliant on old equipment. Last year, U.S. refiners processed nearly 17 million barrels of crude oil every day, the most in the country’s history as it cashes in on a boom in shale oil. But many have decades-old infrastructure, risking outages that could cost the industry billions. The PES refinery is one of nearly 30 in the United States that are more than a century old, while a Reuters review of over 100 operating U.S. refineries that process more than 10,000 barrels of crude oil a day showed they are on average 80 years old. [GRAPHIC: Aging U.S. refineries: tmsnrt.rs/33guhA8]  Refineries frequently update their systems and replace old parts, but the PES fire, along with incidents in Washington state and California earlier this decade, stemmed from equipment installed in the 1970s that had been allowed to run to failure, according to U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) reports. The suspected cause of the PES explosion has raised fears about future incidents because of the leeway given to refiners for inspecting parts, and because some older equipment is exempt from more stringent standards for newly installed parts. “A lot of these refineries around the U.S. are quite old now,” said former CSB managing director Daniel Horowitz, who left the agency last year. “That doesn’t mean that every single piece of equipment dates back to the founding, but they are old and eventually all sorts of components can fail.”  The June 21 Philadelphia blaze was linked to corroded piping that had not been checked since it was installed in 1973, according to the CSB’s initial findings. The fire is still under investigation by the CSB and other public agencies. It caused a fuel leak and explosions that sent toxic hydrofluoric acid (HF) into the air and hurled debris the size of a tractor-trailer across a nearby river, the CSB’s report said. Shortly after the fire, PES filed for bankruptcy protection. Failing, decades-old equipment also sparked a 2010 Tesoro refinery explosion in Anacortes, Washington, that killed seven people, and a Chevron refinery blast in Richmond, California, two years later, according to past CSB reports. In all three cases, the failed equipment contained metal components or designs that were no longer up to industry standards, but their use did not necessarily violate regulations. Regulators offer exemptions for older components, and do not require all pieces of plant machinery to be checked. “That’s a huge problem in this sector, that a lot of codes allow grandfathered equipment to be used even if later standards would have prohibited it,” said Horowitz. The CSB report spurred a letter from top law enforcement official in 13 states, including Pennsylvania, to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), arguing against a proposed rollback of regulations aimed at preventing accidents involving chemicals such as HF. Regulators overseeing U.S. oil refinery safety, primarily the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the EPA, and code-setting industry groups allow some refinery components to keep being used even if they don’t meet newer standards. The EPA and OSHA were not available for comment. The ruptured PES pipe contained levels of nickel and copper that were permitted when installed, but not under recommendations made two decades later by the American Society for Testing and Materials, now called ASTM International, that still stand, according to the CSB. That pipe elbow corroded at a faster rate than other pieces of the system. Oil industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) has about 175 recommended codes that act as the refinery industry’s standards. The API inspection standards for HF alkylation units used in about one-third of U.S. refineries do not call for every piping component to be inspected. API spokesman Scott Lauermann said that its standard for HF units was recognized as the safest way to operate those units, having been recommended by the CSB. PES said it monitored other parts of the piping system according to industry standards, including an examination of a metal elbow near the one that ruptured, and the testing did not show high levels of corrosion. “PES would not have expected the piping to corrode at different rates because the elbows were installed at the same time and the construction specifications indicated that they were the same materials of construction,” PES vice president of strategy and business development Mark Brandon said via email. The CSB findings added to existing concerns by workers about maintenance at the PES refinery, which was already struggling financially, and in January cut back the scope of a planned large-scale maintenance project days before it was scheduled to begin. PES business agents and managers told union officials and major contractors the work would require between 1,500 and 1,800 contract workers, but that was slashed to just 300 contractors, according to five sources familiar with the plan, while pipes and other materials delivered to the plant were never used. Maintaining and inspecting equipment at refineries is required by the OSHA and EPA, but those agencies don’t tell refineries how or when to inspect. Those details are filled in by industry standards that may not have the enforcement of law. The CSB found that prior to the California and Washington fires, as well as the BP Texas City blast in 2005 that killed 15, internal and external instructions for keeping plants operating safely were either ignored or not followed correctly. That regulatory approach makes rules difficult to enforce and allows problems at refineries to go undiscovered, said Jeff Ruch of environmental advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. In the aftermath of the Washington explosion, a judge dismissed $2.4 million in fines against Tesoro because the state could not prove the refinery failed to comply with enforceable rules for inspection and maintenance of equipment. “In terms of, are we making sure in some sort of holistic way that these refineries are safe, there’s nothing there,” said Ruch. “There’s sort of a vacuum.”",1
"People love to hear and pass along bits of secret information that supposedly enable them to gain advantage by manipulating “the system” to their favor — whether the prize to be won is something as potentially significant as beating a breathalyzer test or keeping points off their driver’s licenses, or as trivial as being able to zip through traffic a little faster than other motorists. That in many cases people are passing along rumors about schemes that don’t work (and that they’ve never had occasion to try for themselves) doesn’t seem to slow their proliferation. A slightly different dynamic is at work in the claim that flashing your high beams at a traffic signal will cause it to change from red to green more quickly:  Many motorists have tried it and discovered that it seemingly performs as advertised, thereby documenting the validity of the claim. What they don’t realize, however, is that they’ve stumbled upon another example of the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy. This strategy works, drivers assume, because stop signals are equipped with sensors that respond to the flashing of strobe lights mounted on emergency vehicles. These traffic pre-emption systems automatically interrupt normal traffic light cycling to allow ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars to pass through intersections more quickly and safely by providing them with a steady stream of green lights while keeping opposing traffic halted with red lights. The adventurous motorist thus tries to trick these sensors by rapidly flashing his car’s high beams as he approaches a red-lighted intersection, and voilà — the light turns from red to green. It works! Of course, in many cases the perceived results are nothing more than coincidence — the light was already about to cycle from red to green, and the flashing high beams had no effect. Also, in many places advance sensors are placed in the road well ahead of controlled intersections. When these advance sensors detect the passage of an automobile, they place a “call” to the next traffic signal; if others sensors detect no vehicles waiting at the next cross street ahead, the signal changes from red to green to allow the oncoming car to flow through the intersection smoothly. Since advance sensors are generally placed at a point about the same distance away from intersections as the point where drivers start flashing their high beams to influence upcoming signals, it can easily appear to the unknowing that such flashing does indeed cause lights to change. A problem with a cause-and-effect belief in this scenario is that many intersections aren’t equipped with strobe-detecting sensors, so motorists end up flashing their lights at traffic signals that don’t care. And even when drivers happen upon strobe-enabled signals, the sensors are set to detect lights flashing at a rate so rapid (in the neighborhood of 14 flashes per second) that a human working a manual headlight switch couldn’t possibly imitate it. Moreover, some traffic pre-emption systems are now activated not just by an on-off alternation of lights, but by a specific pattern of flashing.",1
"In early February 2017, various web sites began posting stories regarding a piece of legislation recently passed in the state of Arkansas. Those stories were typically published under misleading headlines such as “New Arkansas Law Allows Rapists to Sue Victims Seeking Abortion” and “Arkansas passes law allowing rapists to prevent victims who want an abortion”: A pregnant woman’s husband will be able to sue to prevent his wife from having an abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, under a new law that could come into effect as early as spring. The new law, Act 45 — the Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, will also allow husbands to sue doctors who carry out abortions for civil damages, as well as block terminations using injunctions. Parents and legal guardians would also be able to sue to prevent minors from having abortions, raising concerns for victims of sexual abuse and incest. The law in question, titled the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act, essentially bans what lawmakers term “dismemberment abortions” (which the medical community refers to as “dilation and evacuation,” or D&E) by making the provision of such a procedure a felony crime. Although the law precludes family members or rapists from suing pregnant women, it does grant spouses, parents, or legal guardians the ability to sue physicians who perform the procedure for damages and obtain injunctions preventing those physicians from performing additional such procedures. JR Davis, spokesman for Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, pointed to a section of the law that prevents damages from being awarded when a terminated pregnancy was the result of a criminal act: “Civil damages shall not be awarded to a plaintiff if the pregnancy resulted from the criminal conduct of the plaintiff.” Thus, a rapist cannot sue his victim and reap any benefits from doing so. Furthermore, the law excludes a woman “who receives or attempts to receive a dismemberment abortion” from civil liability. Davis also pointed out that the language in the law doesn’t enable a woman’s relatives to halt an abortion; rather, it allows them to seek an injunction that prevents “the abortion provider from performing or attempting to perform further dismemberment abortions …” The law, Davis said, was geared toward prosecuting physicians who perform the procedure rather than targeting pregnant women. The thrust of the law is that it makes it a felony for doctors to perform dilation and evacuation abortion procedures, except in cases where such a procedure is necessary to prevent death or physical maiming of the mother. Critics note that the law doesn’t allow an exception for patients to obtain the specified procedure even in cases of rape or incest. According to Davis, the law is “not a prohibition on abortion in the second trimester,” but rather a restriction on a specific abortion method. The ACLU, which plans to challenge the law in court, called it “blatantly unconstitutional” because it bans the most common — and advocates say the safest — method of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy. Bettina Brownstein, ACLU Arkansas co-counsel on the matter, noted in a statement that: The law effectively bans abortions after 14 weeks by making the safest, medically approved procedure a felony. It interferes with best medical practices by substituting safe, evidence-based practices with political ideology … The law imposes an undue burden by placing a substantial obstacle in the way of a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion. It is clearly unconstitutional. According to the Associated Press, the new Arkansas law is similar to legislative actions taken by West Virginia and Mississippi, while related bans in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma are on hold due to ongoing legal challenges.",1
"Despite the vital role automobile seat belts have played in saving thousands and thousands of lives over the last several decades, there is still a group of drivers and passengers who are determined not to wear them, for any number of reasons: because they find them too uncomfortable or confining, because they don’t believe in their efficacy, because they’ve heard that wearing seat belts might actually cost them their lives in certain types of accidents, or because they resent as an unwarranted intrusion of government into private life the plethora of laws now requiring motorists to buckle up. In this vein, we note with a sense of both sadness and irony a couple of articles recently called to our attention. The first is a 17 September 2004 editorial published in the Daily Nebraskan and entitled “Individual Rights Buckle Under Seat Belt Laws,” by Derek Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in which the writer inveighed against mandatory seat belt laws, opining that “Uncle Sam is not here to regulate every facet of life no matter the consequences,” and that “Democrats and Republicans alike should stand together to stop these laws that are incongruous with the ideals of both parties.”  In the midst of his editorial he noted:  As laws become increasingly strict for seat belts, fewer people will respond positively by buckling up in response to the laws. There seems to be a die-hard group of non-wearers out there who simply do not wish to buckle up no matter what the government does. I belong to this group. Evidently his words were far more prescient than any of us might have wanted, as an article in the 4 January 2005 Lincoln Journal Star reported that Mr. Kieper not only died in a car crash, but the tragic mishap that claimed his life was the very type of accident in which seat belts have proved so effective in saving lives by preventing passengers from being ejected from vehicles:  Derek Kieper was a smart, funny, intense young man who relished a good debate and would do anything for his friends. Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died early Tuesday morning when the Ford Explorer he was a passenger in traveled off an icy section of Interstate 80 and rolled several times in a ditch. Kieper, who was riding in the back seat of the Explorer, was ejected from the vehicle. Two others in the vehicle, including the driver, Luke Havermann of Ogallala, and the front-seat passenger, Nick Uphoff of Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, sustained non-life threatening injuries. Havermann and Uphoff, both 21, were being treated at BryanLGH Medical Center West. Derek, who was thrown from the vehicle, was not wearing a seat belt, [Capt. Joe Lefler of the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office] said. He said Havermann and Uphoff were wearing seat belts at the time. In a similar vein, in July 2011 a helmetless motorcyclist participating in a ride to protest mandatory helmet laws was killed when he was thrown over the handlebars of his motorcycle in Onondaga, New York:  Philip A. Contos, 55, of Parish, New York, was on a ride organized by the Onondaga chapter of American Bikers Aimed Towards Education (ABATE). Contos hit his brakes, began fishtailing and lost control of his 1983 Harley Davidson. He shot over the handlebars, hit his head on the pavement and was taken to Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, New York, where he was pronounced dead. State police say evidence at the scene plus information from the attending medical expert indicated Contos would have survived had he been wearing a helmet as required by state law.",0
"""Term limits for Florida's state representatives and senators result in a lot of turnover in Tallahassee after an election. So after the Nov. 2, 2010, election, just how many freshmen House members will there be in 2011? Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon quantified it this way in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times, which was posted on its political blog The Buzz on Dec. 8, 2010. The paragraph starts with a paraphrase:  """"Cannon pointed out that freshmen lawmakers account for one-third of the 120-member House, and that two-thirds of the chamber have two years or less experience,"""" The Buzz wrote, and then quoted Cannon: """"One of the things I'm really focused on is trying to put people where they can best get up to speed and hit the ground running once we start committee meetings in January."""" If Cannon's math is right, that means the majority of the incoming House would have two years of experience or less -- a high number. Those are the numbers we're checking. First, some background on term limits. A Feb. 7, 2010, article in the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald contains some useful background about milestones in Florida's political history, including the vote in favor of term limits in 1992:  """"A string of scandals in Congress spurred a national movement known as term limits aimed at driving career politicians from office. The Florida campaign is known as 'Eight is Enough' and limits Cabinet members and legislators to eight years in office; it passed with a whopping 77 percent in favor. (Ironically, it does not apply to members of Congress). The full effect wouldn't be clear until eight years later, when the eight-year clock kicked in and the state House saw rampant turnover -- 63 of its 120 members were freshmen. Term limits are blamed today for an assortment of ills, from myopia among legislators to the exaggerated influence of special interest money, lobbyists and even the media."""" We should note here some benefits to term limits: fresh faces may provide new ideas and at least initially could be more in touch with constituents back home. For some national perspective on term limits we turn to the National Conference of State Legislatures that provides this background on its website:  """"Proposals to limit the terms of state legislators have been the subject of public policy debate since 1990, when citizen initiatives limiting the terms of legislators were passed by voters in California, Colorado and Oklahoma. Subsequently, 18 other states adopted term limits, but in four -- Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming -- term limits were thrown out by the state supreme courts, and they have been repealed by the legislatures in Idaho and Utah. That leaves 15 states with term limits for legislators. See our current list of states with term limits for legislators."""" Now back to the new faces -- and relatively new faces -- in the 2011 Legislature. First we turned to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta on Dec. 20, 2010, who told us she counted 82 freshman or sophomore legislators -- 44 of those freshmen -- among the 120 state representatives. Betta directed us to the state House website to check her figures. We clicked on the page of each of the 120 members of the House. Each page has some basic biographical information -- heck, even an occasional interesting tidbit such as the recreational interest of newly elected Republican member James W. """"J.W."""" Grant of Tampa: """"Most sports and anything in the woods or on the water."""" The pages also state when each member was first elected to the House, including past service. Here are the totals we found that we will explain in more detail below:   Elected in 2007: 5 Elected in 2008: 33 Elected in 2009: 1 Elected in 2010: 43  That puts the total elected between 2007 and 2010 at 82, so we're at the same starting point as Betta's number. Of the 43 elected this year, three had served in the House previously: Dennis Baxley (R-Ocala), 2000-2007; Gayle Harrell (R-Stuart), 2000-2008; and Irv Slosberg (D-Boca Raton), 2000-2006. Also, two of the 43 were elected in special elections: Janet Cruz (D-Tampa) on Feb. 23 and Matt Gaetz (R-Fort Walton Beach) on April 13. (Cruz and Gaetz then won re-election to full terms this fall.) We define """"freshmen"""" as """"first-year beginners,"""" like high school or college. If we count as freshmen all 43 members elected at any time in 2010, we get a freshmen class that represents about 36 percent of the House. If we don't count Baxley, Harrell and Slosberg as freshmen -- since they've already worked through several sessions each -- then the freshmen class represents 33 percent. But wait, how should we count Cruz, who was elected Feb. 23 just before the regular two-month session started in March? And Gaetz, who was elected April 13 when that regular session only had about two weeks to go? Should they be counted as freshmen in 2011 even though they participated in votes and had their names attached to several bills in 2010? If we omit both of them as freshmen -- as well as the three who had previously served -- that would drop the percentage to about 32 percent. (For the record, Betta says Cannon also counts Mack Bernard (D-West Palm Beach), who won a special election on Sept. 22, 2009, as a freshman, even though he was active in the 2010 session -- bringing her total to 44, or about 37 percent.) Using any of those four figures -- 32 percent, 33 percent, 36 percent or 37 percent -- we are at or very close to the one-third cited by Cannon. Now what about the other part of Cannon’s description, that two-thirds of the members have two years of experience or less? We counted 33 who were elected in 2008, one elected in 2009, and 43 in 2010. That brought our total since 2008 -- two years -- to 77 members, or 64 percent. (Again, if we don’t count the three lawmakers who served previously and easily have more than two years of experience, the percentage drops to 62 percent. Either way, that's close to two-thirds.) Betta wanted us to count five lawmakers who won special elections in 2007 as sophomores because they would be starting their second two-year terms in 2011. But those five have already worked through the legislative sessions of 2008, 2009 and 2010, and we don't see them as sophomores. So is Cannon correct? He was paraphrased as saying that one-third of the 120-member House are freshmen and two-thirds have two years or less experience. We can split hairs on the experience level of  a few of them, but not enough to change his math.""",0
"Back at the end of 2012, the notorious conspiracy-mongering WhatDoesItMean.com web site published a fabricated article holding that then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been injured, and a “top US Navy Seal Commander killed,” when her military plane crashed while she was on a secret mission to Iran to meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad:  A new Foreign Military Intelligence (GRU) report circulating in the Kremlin today is saying that United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was injured, and a top US Navy Seal Commander killed when their C-12 Huron military passenger and transport aircraft crash landed nearly 3 weeks ago in the Iranian city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border. Iranian intelligence agents quoted in this GRU report confirm that the C-12 Huron aircraft is still in their possession in Ahvaz, but will only admit that the plane was “forced to land because of technical problems.” The US Navy Seal member reported killed in this bizarre incident, this report says, was indentified as Commander Job W. Price who as a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit protects high-ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones. As usual, this was just more of the typical WhatDoesItMean.com conspiracy nuttery, spun around the recent tragic suicide of Commander Job W. Price, the 42-year-old leader of U.S. Navy SEAL Team 4, who had killed himself with a pistol while deployed in Afghanistan a few days earlier. And, as usual, the equally notorious and unreliable (but more professional looking) conspiracy-mongering European Union Times web site reprinted WhatDoesItMean.com’s fabricated article about the secret plane crash. The European Union Times‘ version of the fake article gained enough traction that it was eventually shared by a few U.S. military personnel and U.S. Department of State staffers via e-mail, prompting some confusion and chuckles among its recipients: That likely would have been the end of this fake article’s brief lifespan, except for the fact that its having been forwarded via the Department of State’s e-mail system meant it ended up being included among the archive of 30,322 e-mails sent to and from Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server while she was Secretary of State that were released online by WikiLeaks on 16 March 2016. Shortly after Hillary Clinton collapsed at 9/11 memorial service and spurred the renewal of rumors that she was suffering from, and concealing, a major medical ailment (purportedly of a neurological nature), several fringe political sites picked up on the confluence of the 2012 article’s having recently appeared in a State Dept. e-mail leak and ran with the notion that the original four-year-old WhatDoesItMean.com fake news piece was true, that it proved that Clinton was covering up a serious plane crash injury that had left her “unconscious and bleeding profusely,” and that all of this had been “verified” by WikiLeaks: For years we have been given the story over and over again that Hillary Clinton is fine and she is perfectly healthy. The story line gradually morphed into Hillary “fell” and suffered a concussion, which then, in turn, led to brain clots. Well, color me NOT surprised but apparently that was all a lie told by a couple that wouldn’t know the truth if it bit them! WikiLeaks has released another round of emails exposing some MAJOR bombshells surrounding Hillary. In this latest batch of emails, WikiLeaks reveals that Hillary Clinton was apparently in a C-12 Huron aircraft that was forced to make an emergency landing at Ahwaz International Airport. This airport happens to be located on the border of Iran and Iraq … [a crash landing] left Hillary “unconscious and bleeding profusely” according to the reports released by WikiLeaks. The report indicates that Hillary was on some sort of secret mission and traveling with the members of Seal team 4. One of the members of that team was reportedly killed when the aircraft crash-landed. The government had previously claimed that Commander Job W. Price died of a possible “suicide.” His death was listed as a non-combat related injury. Commander Price was a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit. Their mission was to protect high-ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones. US military flight logs recorded by Russian air and space forces confirm that Commander Price, and other members of US Navy Seal Team 4, left their base in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan on a flight to US Naval Support Activity Bahrain where they met up with the then-Secretary of State, Hillary, and all of them transferred to the C-12 Huron and proceeded to fly to Baghdad. As we noted at the head of this article, the fantastic “secret plane crash” tale was a complete fabrication, and it appeared on WikiLeaks only because some State Department staffers had forwarded the article among themselves via-email. The article’s supposed “bombshell” contents originated with (and were reported by no source other than) WhatDoesItMean.com, of whom RationalWiki says: Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of “reports” published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don’t think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don’t contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.",1
"Q: Did a law go into effect Jan. 30 banning “anyone” from smoking in a car “as long as there are children in the vehicle”? A: No. There is no federal prohibition, although several state and local governments previously had enacted such bans. There is no law or proposed legislation at the federal level that bans smoking in cars with children present.Facebook users recently flagged a story as potentially false that was published in February on amomama.com under the headline: “Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018.” They were right to be suspicious of the story.The article claims that, since the end of January, smoking in “any private vehicle” with minors present has been punishable by a $100 fine. It says the purported law is aimed at alleviating the (very real) effects of secondhand smoke.Although the story is false, it is based on a tiny kernel of truth.A link in the story leads to a news story posted by Yahoo Lifestyle about a bill, passed Jan. 30 by Alabama’s House of Representatives, that would ban smoking in cars with individuals under the age of 19 present. Violators of that proposed state law would incur a $100 fine.That does not mean that “a ban has been applied since last month,” as the article on amomama.com says. The legislation still must be approved by the state Senate, and Republican Gov. Kay Ivey would have to sign it. Even then, the law would not take effect until the “first day of the third month” following the Alabama governor’s approval, according to language in the bill.But the article does not say that it’s referring to an Alabama bill that hasn’t been enacted. Nor does it specify whether it refers to federal, state or local law.One of the last major federal tobacco-related bills to become law was 2010’s Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act. It did not prohibit smoking in cars with children present.On the other hand, there are eight states, as well as Puerto Rico and Guam, that already had laws to that effect prior to 2018, according to the Public Health Law Center. In addition, a number of cities and towns have passed ordinances of their own.Outside of the United States, England banned smoking in a car with kids in October 2015. The fine in the U.K. is £50, or currently about $70.Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.Sihlangu, Junie. “Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018.” Amomama.com.

"At no time during the release is the potential cost of a possible treatment ever mentioned. That’s understandable since the work is only being done in animal models and far-removed from eventual clinical use. But the release suggests that human use is close at hand. If the procedure were ready for clinical use in humans, it would involve costly eye surgery as well as the very costly and complicated manipulation of human skin cells so that they become stem cells. While the cost of these processes will inevitably fall, it’s likely to remain substantive. Now that we’ve established that the work was done in lab rats, did the news release quantify how successful the experimental approach was? Did it give numbers about how many animals were “treated” and how many benefited? No. The release only stated: “The stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans.”  But that doesn’t give any idea of the rate of effectiveness – even in rats. And equating this – at this early stage – to what could happen in humans is, well, imaginative. The release fails to mention any potential harms from the procedure, although it appears to involve piercing of the eyeball and injecting cells inside. It would also appear that the procedure requires a small slice through the cornea to release pressure within the eye from adding the stem cells. And while the eye is well-known to be one of the fastest healing of our organs, any surgery involves potential risks. While the release does point out that the cells, as they multiply, form a kind of protective layer in the back of the eye, it does not mention — as the actual research paper does — that that layer may interfere with the supply of nutrients to cells in the eye, leading to their death. Nor does the release mention the potential problem of rejection of the foreign cells, which the research paper explains. The release gave no true sense of the huge leap there may be between findings in lab rats and experiments in people. Instead, it pushed heavily the implication that humans will soon benefit. The headline literally says, “Stem cell injection may soon reverse vision loss . . .”  A co-author is quoted saying they’re “close to a time” when this approach can be used on humans. How does one compare rat vision with human vision? In the published journal article about this work, the researchers explain that they used several tests to gauge whether the animals could detect movement and other measure of “seeing.”  But humans require vision to include clarity and detail and the tests used in this research can only provide a gross measure of those factors. Finally, in some of the early Phase I human trials with other stem cell therapies, response was neither universal nor beyond the “promising” stage of improved light recognition. There was no disease-mongering of the serious problem of macular degeneration in the news release. The release includes at the end a listing of funding sources for this research and there is no information to suggest any conflict of interest. The original research paper specifically states there are no conflicts. The news release included no discussion of alternative approaches or other research being done on age-related macular degeneration. There are ongoing early clinical trials of stem cells in the treatment of AMD using cells differently derived than the ones reported here. So there are “alternatives” to this particular type of stem cell therapy that also may show promise. There are a few reports from Japan and elsewhere suggesting that there are alternatives to “bolus injections” of stem cells that may pose risks. In addition, some current federal clinical trials have found that some vitamin and mineral supplements appear to reduce the risk of late-onset of the disease by as much as 25 percent. So this is not the only work being done in this field, as the news release might suggest to some journalists or to the general public. Even a brief mention of other research would have been important context to improve public comprehension. The release suggests, through researcher quotes and other descriptions that this treatment may be just around the corner. That is clearly an exaggeration. The researchers still need more work in animal models. Then they will require FDA approval for an investigational drug. If that comes about, then substantial clinical trials in humans will be needed. All told, that could mean years of additional wor, before the procedure might be available for people. Is that how you would define “soon” or “close to a time”? We will give the news release the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. But here’s why it’s a coin toss. The release states: “This is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration.” That may be. There are some ways in which these particular stem cells are novel. But other stem cell approaches have been developed and in some cases are in in early phase human trials or animal tests. However, since we have already dinged this release in the “Alternatives” criterion above for failing to give that context, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt here. The headline’s use of “may soon reverse vision loss,” Svendsen’s quote saying they’re “close to a time” of treating humans, and the cavalier referral to the “next steps” without explaining that means many more years of study, all support a rating of unsatisfactory in this category. Anytime a news release raises hopes for treatment of a now-untreatable disease, it has to live up to those expectations. This one didn’t.",1
"On 3 September 2017, a Facebook page promoting the anti-vaccine movie “Vaxxed” shared a video of an undeniably cool science experiment (which they appear to have since removed). This video, which featured a chemical reaction between aluminum and mercury resulting in the creation of a grotesque, gothic looking tower of aluminum oxide, is irrelevant to vaccine safety in myriad significant ways. Despite this irrelevance — and without actually offering a concrete scientific principle of which to be afraid — the video was captioned: Hmmm… What mandated medical injections also combine thimerosal (mercury), which still remains in several vaccines and aluminium, used in almost all vaccines? It’s time to reject vaccine MYTH and embrace the truth. The answer to the post’s unnecessarily rhetorical question, which attempts to exploit fears over the mercury based preservative thimerosal and a series of aluminum-containing ingredients in some vaccines, would have been fairly easy to look up prior to posting and then deleting: none. Of all the vaccines approved for use in the United States, only one — a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine — contains both the mercury-derived thimerosal and an aluminum compound (aluminum phosphate). This vaccine, however, is not mandated. It is also irrelevant, because a reaction between thimerosal and aluminum phosphate is fundamentally different than the one in the video. In the original version, posted by YouTube chemical reaction filmer NileRed on 13 August 2017, the two reactants were metallic mercury (Hg) and metallic aluminum (Al). In contrast, the theoretical reactants hypothesized by the post would be thimerosal, a mercury-containing organic compound (C9H9HgNaO2S), and aluminum phosphate (AlPO4), a mineral. These two chemicals share little with the elemental metals used in the video, because they are literally different chemicals. Just because two compounds might share the same element does not de facto mean they will behave in similar fashion. Metallic elemental sodium creates a wildly dangerous explosion if it comes into contact with any moisture. Sodium when chemically bonded with chloride, however, becomes table salt. Finally, the edited version of the video neglected to show how challenging it was to get the reaction started in the first place, as well as to mention the rather significant fact that it included a third chemical to initiate the reaction. Because metallic aluminum, when exposed to oxygen, is naturally coated in aluminum oxide, the mercury needs to be in contact with freshly exposed aluminum metal. The YouTube scientist first tried scraping at the aluminum while the liquid mercury rested on top, then turned things up a notch with the use of a drill. No luck. He finally solved the problem chemically by reacting the aluminum surface with hydrochloric acid, as narrated in the original video: Under normal conditions, aluminum is surrounded by a protective oxide layer. Metallic mercury isn’t able to penetrate through this barrier, so it kind of does nothing. Sometimes it’s possible to get things going by manually scratching away the oxide layer. I tried doing this about two or three times, but it wasn’t working for me. I even tried to bruteforce things using a drill, but that didn’t get things going either. […] I took out all the mercury and I added some dilute hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid quickly reacts with the oxide layer and dissolves it away. This exposes fresh aluminum metal. Needless to say, these are not the conditions (or even the chemicals) one would find in a vaccine of any kind or within the human body. NileRed described the process behind the footage in his video, as well: The major thing going on here is the combination of the mercury with the aluminum to form the amalgam [a chemical term for an aluminum based alloy]. Some of the amalgam that forms gets dissolved in the mercury and makes its way to the top. When it gets there, it comes in contact with oxygen in the air, and it reacts to form white aluminum oxide. This part of the process is pretty short-lived, though, because it quickly gets covered and protected by the oxide. This prevents fibers from growing directly from the mercury, but obviously they continue going out from the sides. […] The dissolved mercury can continue to creep along the surface and amalgamate more aluminum. In theory, this process should keep going until the entire surface is covered with a thick layer of the oxide.",1
"""Promoting his book, Texas Gov. Rick Perry bemoaned a failure  in Washington to confront Social Security's financial shakiness and praised three Texas counties that quit Social Security nearly 30 years ago. Perry said on CNN's Nov. 4 Parker Spitzer: """"Here's what I think would be a very wise thing. In 1981, Matagorda, Brazoria, and Galveston Counties all opted out of the Social Security program for their employees. Today, their program is very, very well-funded and there is no question about whether it’s going to be funded in"""" years to come. Perry said one option going forward would be to let states decide whether to stay in Social Security or take a different approach to retirement savings. A reader asked us if Perry recapped the Texas experience correctly. Last month, we rated Perry's statement that Social Security, the federal program that provides old-age and disability payments, is a Ponzi scheme. The program may be fiscally shaky, but it's not a fraudulent criminal enterprise. In Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, Perry prefaces a reference to the Texas counties by saying Americans would fare better if they had the choice of making contributions to a private investment plan rather than Social Security. """"Employees in those private plans, having exercised their liberty at Washington's sufferance, are reaping the benefits,"""" Perry writes. A footnote points to an April 2005 article on Galveston County's experiences published by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Policy Analysis. That article, co-authored by Ray Holbrook, a former Galveston County judge, says Galveston's county employees """"sought a secure, risk-free alternative to the Social Security system, and it has worked very well for nearly a quarter-century. Our retirees have prospered, and our working people have had the security of generous disability and accidental death benefits."""" According to the article, county employees committed to investing their payroll contributions in fixed-rate guaranteed annuities rather than fluctuating stocks, bonds or mutual funds. The result: Annual rates of return of 6.5 percent averaged over 24 years, the article says, plus substantially better benefits in three Social Security pay-out categories: retirement, survivorship and disability. """"To be sure, our plan wasn't perfect, and we have made some adjustments,"""" the article says. """"For instance, a few of our retired county workers are critical of the plan today because they say they are making less money than they would have on Social Security. This is because our plan allowed workers to make 'hardship' withdrawals from the retirement plan during their working years. Some workers withdrew funds for current financial problems and consequently robbed their own future benefits. We closed that option (in January 2005)."""" We learned from Rick Gornto, the certified financial planner who helped start and still oversees the alternate plans, that plan participants can take their accumulated earnings in a lump sum or in regular installments once they retire. """"They do have an opportunity to take it out and squander it,"""" Gornto said, adding that the lump-sum option might be eliminated in the future. Gornto said the reason that hasn't happened yet is that the annuities began as a supplement to county employees' primary retirement program -- fixed payments through pension plans managed by the Texas County and District Retirement System, which is based in Austin. Perry didn't mention this plan in his book or on CNN. Gornto said the safety net of the county and district retirement plan made it possible to design the alternate plan with its lump-sum feature. If the other pension plan wasn't in place, Gornto said, he probably would have proposed a plan without a lump-sum feature and offering regular post-retirement payments along with the leeway to invest earnings. The 2005 article mentions 1999 reviews of the Galveston plan by the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Social Security Administration. We turned to them next. Among points the agencies raised:  +Low-paid workers stood to get less in monthly retirement payments under the alternate plan than they would under Social Security. In response, the 2005 article says the studies assumed a low 4 percent return on the plans' annuities; actual returns have been substantially higher. +Workers with higher earnings and fewer or no dependents who qualify for Social Security generally fare better under the Galveston plan, particularly in the near term, but workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security, the report says. +Galveston's retirement funds are invested at the county's discretion and employees do not control investment decisions. During 1981-97, annual interest earned on the plan's fixed annuity contracts averaged an inflation-adjusted 4.62 percent. During the period, annual interest earned on Social Security's investments averaged 4.88 percent, the administration report says. On the plus side, the GAO review notes: """"The alternate plans' benefits are fully funded, while Social Security's promised benefits cannot be met without increasing program revenues."""" Finally, we chased up-to-date information per the Texas plans' health. The county treasurers for Brazoria and Matagorda counties, Amy Perez and Sharon Reynolds, respectively, told us their plans work well. Like a Galveston County official, Perez and Reynolds suggested we gather particulars from Gornto. Gornto said in an interview that a key to the alternate plans' appeal is their guaranteed annual return, now at least 3.75 percent. He added that unlike Social Security, which needs changes to remain financially viable in the long term, the counties' plans don't confront a money-gone date: """"We don't have an 'out-year' question issue because people put their money in, they match it, and whatever it grows to is what they get."""" He said up-front contributions to the plans will remain stable so long as the counties don't go broke, while pay-outs to beneficiaries are certain unless the United States completely devalues its currency. """"The money will be there,"""" Gornto said. Gornto forwarded a summary of his firm's review of the Galveston County plan for October 2008 through September 2009. In an interview, he noted that by the end of that year, the plan had $54.1 million available to be paid employees in deferred (or retirement) compensation. Employees and the county combined pitched in about $6 million in payroll contributions through the year. """"The county has adopted this program to replace Social Security,"""" Gornto said. """"Until they make a decision to disband the plan, it will always be there."""" For outside expertise, we talked to Keith Brainard, who's the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. After reviewing the materials Gornto shared with us, Brainard explained that the alternate plan is a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401k plan, in which benefits are determined solely based on contributions and investment earnings. """"By definition, the plan is always fully funded because the plan pays out only as much as it collects,"""" Brainard said in an e-mail. That said, Brainard wrote, the plan lacks three features that are part of Social Security: a minimum benefit for lower-income workers; protection from inflation; and required annuitization, meaning that participants must receive at least some of their benefit as a lifetime income stream, rather than as a single lump-sum. On the other hand, he said, the long-term cost of the Texas plan is clear and certain. Also, unlike Social Security, plan participants own their retirement assets, rather than being entitled only to a monthly benefit for the remainder of their lives. The basic difference between the Texas plan and Social Security, Brainard said, is that the Texas plan is a """"retirement savings plan that provides benefits based on contributions and investment performance, while Social Security is an insurance plan intended chiefly to prevent stark poverty in old age. Social Security promises a certain level of benefits based on salary and other factors, with a minimum benefit for lower-income workers and a maximum for higher-income workers. Both plans present relative advantages and disadvantages, and an argument could be made for providing elements of both plan types for all working Americans."""" And how does Perry's statement fare? Far as we can tell, the alternate plans are healthy and should remain so. But the Texas plans serve employees also eligible, depending on years of service, for the Austin-based pension plan. Perry's larger point, that Americans stand to benefit from swapping out Social Security for alternate plans, doesn't acknowledge this pre-existing safety net in the Texas counties.""",0
"The story does not mention costs — particularly important since the treatment might have to be taken for life. It’s reportedly due to come on the market next year. The story reports that two-thirds of people who underwent months of treatment were able at the end of the study to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts. Unlike the Fox News story, CNN reports on how the control group fared, saying that 53% of those subjects required rescue epinephrine with the final peanut challenge test compared to 11% of subjects in the treatment group. The story describes harms through the profile of one patient: “Ellis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study,” and once she had an anaphylactic reaction which required medical attention. And this was a successful patient story. The story also reports that 11% of participants dropped out of the study as a result of side effects. However, it left out important issues such as the higher dropout rate — around 20%, mainly due to adverse events — among those who received the treatment, and unknown long-term effects. The story reports the size of the study. It also emphasizes, repeatedly, the limitations of the protection against peanut exposure — not all those treated were protected, and even the positive outcomes were laced with allergic reactions along the way. The story appropriately characterizes peanut allergy as a “potentially life-threatening” condition, with peanut ingestion. It also says peanut and tree nut allergies affect “an estimated 3 million Americans or more,” although it’s not clear what number of those would benefit from this treatment. The story includes several expert sources, including a doctor who was not involved in the study and who does not appear to be funded by potential treatment-makers. The story makes clear that there is currently no approved treatment for peanut allergy. In addition, the profiled patient is described as having to eat her school lunch at a peanut-free table, showing reader the practice of avoiding exposure — currently the only way to manage a peanut allergy. However, the story doesn’t mention that AR101 is among at least four peanut immunotherapy products potentially entering the market. The story makes clear that the treatment is not yet FDA-approved, and is not currently commercially available. The story says that the treatment would be a new one, making clear that no other approved product exists for treating peanut allergy. It doesn’t explain that immunotherapy — which attempts to desensitize people with food allergies by giving them tiny doses of the food they’re allergic to over time — is an old idea. The story goes well beyond the information provided in a news release.",0
"The costs associated with CPAP technology are not presented. No discussion of costs of sleep lab evaluation. No discussion of insurance coverage for these approaches. Estimates of benefits are presented in general terms , e.g.,”I sleep better”, and “I no longer snore”. But an expectation for the size of the benefits obtained, how reproducible they are, and the time needed to realize them is not presented. Early in the story, the CPAP machine is described as looking like Darth Vader on life support. This at least helps with a reasonable image of what the “simple” device looks like. Although health and quality of life claims are made, there is no mention of the type of evidence to support the anecdotal stories presented. Estimate presented for >12 million afflicted with sleep apnea though most are undiagnosed. There are quotes from three different health care providers who work in the area of sleep medicine; there are also several quotes from people who have experienced benefit from the use of CPAP. Article make clear that lifestyle changes, weight reduction, and surgery are other methods that are available and used to help manage this condition. Article does not mention that CPAP devices are FDA approved for the treatment of sleep apnea. However, it is clear that it is a readily available treatment. The story doesn’t claim that this is a new treatment. Neither does it explain that it’s been in use for a long time. The use of constant positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device used to treat obstructive sleep apnea is not new. Such devices, initially used with neonates, begun being used in this adult population in the 1980s. There is no evidence that this story relied solely or largely on a news release.",0
"The story mentions that currently Herceptin costs $76,700 for 12-month treatment. Presumably that cost would be reduced with 6-month treatment, though it’s unclear to what extent. Readers also are told that the cost is expected to go down as similar drugs by other pharmaceutical companies enter the US market. The story describes the main outcome of the study with numbers: “In both the six- and 12-month groups, about 90 percent of women were cancer-free after four years.” The story makes clear that one motivation for reducing the overall course of Herceptin treatment was to reduce serious side effects, namely cardiac toxicity. Indeed, the shorter treatment halved the number of women who had to stop treatment because of heart issues, to about 4%. The story noted the study size (4,000-plus women), the equivalency of the main outcome, and the reduction of harm. It made clear that analysis is ongoing on other important outcomes, such as quality of life. It also included mostly cautious positive reactions by the sources quoted, including the Chief Medical Officer of Roche, the drug’s maker: “Many, many people in the field have been looking at the question over a number of years, and these data will need to be viewed in the context of that larger group.” However, there was no warning about the fact that the data is preliminary and no one can review it yet (no actual research was “released,” even though the story frames it that way). Important details and concerns may not surface until the complete data are available to be reviewed by the scientific community. No disease-mongering here. The story quotes three sources: a study author, a representative from drug’s maker Roche, and an oncologist not involved in the study. We would have liked to see a bit more information on these people. For instance, the Associated Press reported that the study author, Helena Earl “has consulted for Herceptin’s maker, Roche,” but the company had “no role in the study.” The story informs readers of other studies that have evaluated longer and shorter treatment durations, from six months (inconclusive results) to two years (no benefit). The story makes clear that the current standard of care is 12 months of Herceptin treatment. It also cautions, near the top of the piece, that: “more research will be needed before a wholesale change in medical practice.” The story notes that this is the largest study to date that evaluates a short treatment duration for Herceptin and that it was funded by the UK’s National Institute for Health Research, not the drug company. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.",0
"On 17 January 2018, the 8Shit web site published an article reporting that a tourist in Spain had suffered an unfortunate bout of diarrhea while visiting an amusement park: Spain. — A man was enjoying his vacations in one of the most important museums, buildings, gardens, monuments and restaurants in Port Aventura, Spain. He was convinced by his friends to get on the best ride of the park, Ferrari Land. The man, who knew he was suffering from gastroenteritis, accepted, and his nightmare started. On the first slope, at a speed of almost 200km/h (124 mi/h), the man noticed that his stomach was not doing well. At the first looping, he couldn’t stop himself and was forced to let it all out. The shit was flying all over the place and splashed 14 people, who were sharing the exciting ride. Many of them threw up because they had shit on their hair, face and clothing. The man faced no charges because this was involuntarily. The 8Shit article was lifted from information published on the Spanish-language web site Hay Noticia, which read (roughly translated): It happened in an amusement park in Spain. A London family was enjoying their vacation visiting the most important cities, museums, buildings, gardens, monuments, restaurants in the country, and at the request of their two daughters, the Port Aventura amusement park. Candy, the older sister, convinced Sabina to ride in the park’s most thrilling attraction, the Ferrari Land. Sabina, despite suffering from gastroenteritis caused by the change in meals and schedules, reluctantly accepted and accompanied her sister on the ride. Wearing a skirt and flip-flops, they grabbed the rails of the roller coaster car and … their nightmare began. In the first drop, at almost 200km/h, Sabina’s felt sick to her stomach, and she could not control her sphincter, evacuating feces in an almost liquid state that flew out and splashed 14 other people who were also riding the attraction, causing some of them to vomit when they noticed the poop on their faces, hair and clothes. It is still not known if the park’s insurance carrier will be responsible for the damages caused. None of this was true.

"Cost is not addressed. Would this be a relatively inexpensive treatment? A costly one? Is it too early to tell? Readers won’t be informed of this. Here is how the story addresses benefits regarding the follow-up study: “In the follow-up, which tracked the children for four years after they were treated with the combination therapy, 67% of those who got the combination probiotic and peanut therapy were comfortable eating peanuts, compared to only 4% of those who did not get the treatment. Fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts, and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.” The description does offer some numbers, but does it adequately “quantify the benefits”? We’ll say yes. However, there are significant problems about the evidence discussion, which we’ll go into under the heading of “Quality of Evidence,” below. Harms aren’t mentioned, which is problematic. The type of immunotherapy used in conjunction with probiotics for this study is called peanut oral immunotherapy. In a 2016 research summary document, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology describe this type of immunotherapy as “one of the more promising new treatments” for peanut allergies. Specifically, the summary noted that “Multiple studies have now shown [oral immunotherapy] to be efficacious at desensitizing peanut-allergic children, but this efficacy comes at the expense of high rates of allergic adverse events, and the risk/benefit ratio of [oral immunotherapy] is an area requiring more study.” This is a complex area, and the research summary is worth reading, but the key point here is that there are risks associated with oral immunotherapy — and this story doesn’t acknowledge them. The story focuses on a follow-up study that involved only 48 participants. The story doesn’t tell readers how many people were involved in the study, nor whether the number of participants is important. The study was a follow-up to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial — all of which is important to understanding how robust these findings are, and none of which is mentioned in the story. And while the story offered numbers on one measure of benefit (how many patients who received the combination treatment were eating peanuts compared to those who received placebo), it offered no numbers on the other outcomes that were assessed. That can affect how readers view the findings. For example, readers may have had a different perspective on the findings if the story had instead focused on these numbers from the journal article: “Four [combination]-treated participants and six placebo participants reported allergic reactions to peanut after intentional or accidental intake since stopping treatment, but none had anaphylaxis.” No disease mongering here. The story does include input from one independent source, and that source highlights some significant questions regarding the study. For example, as the source notes, it’s not clear what role (if any) the probiotics played in the study outcomes. In other words, it’s not clear if the combination therapy achieved better results than would have been achieved using only immunotherapy without the probiotics. But while the story did touch base with an independent source, it did not clearly address conflicts of interest. Here’s a line from the Aug. 16 news release issued by the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI), where the relevant clinical trials were conducted: “This follow up study was initially funded by MCRI and the Australian Food Allergy Foundation. It then received a $15 million funding commitment in 2016 from capital investment firm, OneVentures. A biotech company Prota Therapeutics, was jointly set up by the MCRI and OneVentures to develop [a combined probiotics and oral immunotherapy treatment] towards an FDA approved product with a plan to make the vital treatment available globally to people with peanut allergy.” That’s the sort of thing readers should know. As noted above, the story notes that it is not clear whether the combination therapy works better than treatment that uses only immunotherapy. And the story does refer, briefly, to earlier immunotherapy studies. That’s enough to earn a satisfactory rating here. However, a little more information on standard treatments and up-and-coming immunotherapy research would have made the story much stronger. The story doesn’t address how far along in the development process this combination therapy is, nor how far removed it may be from clinical use. The novelty here would appear to be that this is a long-term follow-up to a study that used probiotics in conjunction with oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy. That’s inferred here, rather than stated explicitly, which isn’t necessarily a deal breaker. But after talking about what impact probiotics might have had in the treatment results, the story ultimately tells readers that figuring out what sets this research apart “may have to wait for another study.” Having to include language like that is likely a sign to steer clear of a headline like this one: “New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy.” Then again, the new therapy may not. By talking to an independent source, the story goes beyond a news release.",1
"""The logic behind preventive care seems simple enough: stopping illnesses before they happen will mean fewer pricey procedures at the hospital and lower health care costs for all. Not so, says columnist David Brooks, who was interviewed on the Aug. 14, 2009, edition of the  NewsHour with Jim Lehrer  . He said President Barack Obama claims that """"preventive care saves money,"""" but the reality is """"that's not . ... If you're testing people, say, for an illness, you have to give 100 people a test to get five people — to find five people. Now, preventive care is good for health. Everyone agrees on that. But if you look at the CBO studies and the other research, it doesn't save you money. We should do it. But because you have to test so many people to get the few you're really going to prevent serious illness from, you're really not adding up to a lot of cost saving."""" Brooks was talking about a core principle of Obama's health care overhaul: That many costly procedures and treatments can be prevented by catching disease earlier or preventing it all together. Operating under that logic, the House health care bill expands access to procedures such as hypertension screening and vaccines. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer sang the praises of preventive care in an Aug. 10  USA Today  op-ed. """"Reform will also mean higher-quality care by promoting preventive care so health problems can be addressed before they become crises,"""" they wrote. """"This, too, will save money. We'll be a much healthier country if all patients can receive regular checkups and tests, such as mammograms and diabetes exams, without paying a dime out-of-pocket."""" Brooks's critique relied on new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office that indicate that preventive care isn't as cost-effective as Pelosi and Hoyer claim. """"The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall,"""" CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive:   """"But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. ... Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it."""" In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on. The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in the House bills because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the  New England Journal of Medicine  that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care. """"Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching,"""" according to the paper. """"Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs."""" And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, """"as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs."""" So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it's a stretch to say that it will save government spending on health care. As a result, we give Brooks a .""",0
"""In an Aug. 29, 2011, column, Robert Reich, the former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton and a frequent liberal commentator, offered a number of statistics to back up his call for worker protests rather than parades on Labor Day. """"Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades,"""" Reich’s column began. """"But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade."""" One of the statistics Reich offered was this: """"The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression."""" A reader asked us to check this out, so we did. We turned to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal office that calculates official statistics about the economy. We found numbers for corporate profits as well as for two measures of worker income -- wage and salary disbursements, and total employee compensation received. We then divided corporate profits by both of the income measurements, all the way back to 1929. (Here are the full statistics from 1929 to 2011 as we calculated them.) For wages, we found that Reich was essentially correct. The ratio in 2010 -- the last full year in the statistics -- was .281, which was higher than any year back to at least 1929, the earliest year in the BEA database. The next highest ratio was in 2006, at .265. (We didn’t find pre-1929 data, so the one part of Reich’s statement that we can’t prove is that the ratio was higher """"just before the Great Depression."""") We also looked at total compensation, since the portion of worker compensation delivered outside of wages has grown significantly since 1929. The numbers were slightly different, but the general pattern still held. The ratio in 2010 was .226, which was matched or exceeded in only four years -- 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1950. To capture the most up-to-date trends, we also looked at the ratios for the last six quarters. For both wages and compensation, the ratio has risen steadily over that year-and-a-half period. For wages, the ratio has climbed from .274 in the first quarter of 2010 to .290 in the second quarter of 2011. For compensation, the ratio has risen from .220 in the first quarter of 2010 to .234 in the second quarter of 2011. So numerically, there’s little question that Reich is essentially right. (Or, at least for now he is. Economists note that statistics about corporate profits and wages are often revised after the fact.) A more interesting question is what this trendline actually means. First, we’ll note that the ratio has been remarkably steady over the time we studied. In 2010, corporate income was 168 times what it was in 1929, and wages were 124 times what they were in 1929. But despite the dramatic increases for both measures individually, these two numbers have grown pretty much in tandem. While corporate profits have grown faster, they haven’t grown dramatically faster. Over the eight-decade period, the ratio between corporate profits and wages -- at least prior to 2010 -- almost always hovered between .150 and .235, a pretty narrow range, all things considered. Within this range, the ratio has regularly zigzagged up and down. The ratio has peaked during World War II, the early 1950s, the mid1960s, the mid1990s and the middle of the first decade of the 21st century. The 2010 high broke with this history, making the statistic Reich is talking about all the more striking. And as the quarterly data shows, the spike from 2010 has continued into 2011. This spike has its roots in basic mathematics. The ratio can rise for either of two reasons -- because corporate profits rise, or because wages stagnate. To a greater degree than in past recessions, both of these developments have happened simultaneously in 2010 and 2011. That’s the immediate reason for the ratio’s sudden increase. The ratio was well within historical norms as recently as 2009, the second year of the recession. Today, """"indicators favorable to workers are either absolutely dreadful, like the percentage of the adult population that is employed, or else improving at a not-very-robust rate, like real compensation per hour, while indicators favorable to business owners, such as record profit levels measured in billions of current dollars, are very delightful indeed,"""" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. There are any number of explanations for why businesses are so reluctant to invest their profits today. For instance, Dan Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the pattern of low corporate investment that we’re seeing today has to do with """"a climate of economic uncertainty, largely thanks to the threat of more taxes and regulations."""" But the explanation that seems to mesh best with our numbers has to do with economic cycles. While the ratio Reich points to is exaggerated today due to an unusually deep recession and an especially sluggish recovery, the general pattern follows that of other recent recessions, said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Typically, businesses initially lose ground during a recession, while workers suffer somewhat less, in part due to """"sticky wages"""" -- the tendency for worker pay to increase or stagnate rather than fall, even in hard times. This pattern tends to decrease the ratio of corporate profits to wages. However, when the recovery begins, the reverse becomes  -- businesses tend to gain ground faster than workers do, since soft labor markets prevent workers from reaping the rewards of improved productivity. This pushes the ratio of profits to wages higher. Since the current recovery is particularly weak, the increase in the ratio has been even stronger than normal. The hopeful news for workers, Foster says, is that once a recovery gathers steam and new capital-labor equilibrium is reached, workers tend to accelerate their gains. """"Once a strong recovery is under way and labor markets return to normal, total labor compensation tends to catch up, as employers bid for employees out of the extra profit margin they accumulated during the recovery,"""" Foster said. """"So once we start heading toward full employment, we can expect total labor compensation to rise very rapidly relative to total income."""" So where does this leave us? On the numbers, Reich’s claim is essentially correct. And in his analysis, Reich doesn’t over-promise on what the data indicate. Amid evidence that these numbers could turn out to be a temporary spike, he resists the temptation to label it the culmination of a long-term trend. We find Reich’s formulation both factually supportable and appropriately cautious in its interpretation. We give it a rating of .""",0
"On 1 March 2017, the web site World News Daily Report (WNDR) reported that Beaumont, Texas, morgue worker Henri Paul Johnson was inadvertently incinerated by a coworker as he napped on the job: An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning, after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap one a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Also depicted in the article was Jenna Davis, a coworker who purportedly heard Johnson’s death screams:  Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.” As is the case with all content published by WNDR, a fake news site, there was no truth to the story. The article’s photograph of the supposedly deceased morgue worker “Henri Paul Johnson” was actually a picture of a DeSoto County constable Christopher Plumlee, who was arrested in 2015 for DUI. And the photograph of coworker “Jenna Davis” was actually a picture of forensic pathologist Dr. Lisa Funte, taken from a May 2012 Beaumont Enterprise profile of her. Variations: The story was reposted by a site spoofing ABC News (abcnews-us.com) in December 2017 and March 2018: An employee of a local Huntersville funeral home died this morning, after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Huntersville medical examiner, 48-year old Kenneth Brooks decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Although names and locations in the article changed, the basic premise (and its lack of veracity) remained the same. The image reproduced above accompanied the story and was taken from a March 2016 WREG report about a funeral home in Atlanta which had nothing to do with a morgue employee who was “accidentally cremated.” In April 2018, the fake news site 8shit.net repurposed this story as an April Fool’s prank in which a morgue employee pretending to be dead was cremated by co-workers: It’s April Fools. Everyone wants to prank their friends, family and even customers, but this man got it very wrong. 27-year old Thomas McClure is now an ex-employee of a morgue in Boston, after he tried to prank his coworkers by pretending he was dead. To achieve his goal, he took an overdose of sleeping pills, with the idea that he was gonna be so unconscious that there would be no way to wake him up. And everything went exactly as planned: He took the pills in the morning and started doing his job. A few minutes later, he fell asleep on the floor and no one was able to wake him up. They tried pouring water on his face, slapping him, but nothing worked. The prank worked like a charm, and all the employees were sad because they thought their friend was dead. Unfortunately, they reached to the conclusion that he was, indeed, dead, and decided to cremate him.",1
"Barbosa, 18, blames the break-up on her baby’s abnormally small head and brain damage that doctors link to the Zika virus she contracted during pregnancy. “I think, for him, it was my fault the baby has microcephaly,” said Barbosa, wearing a blue dress and cradling tiny two-week old Sophia in a cramped bare brick house where she now lives with her parents in Brazil’s northeast. “When I most needed his help, he left me.”   The house, which overlooks a polluted stream on the edge of a poor neighborhood, is now home to a family of nine. Only Barbosa’s father has a job doing occasional building work. Her ex-partner, Thersio, says he does not see Sophia, but avoids discussing microcephaly and blames Barbosa’s parents for the break-up. “I gave her the choice, are you your parents’ woman or mine ... And she chose her parents.”   Single parents are common in Brazil where some studies show as many as 1 in 3 children from poor families grow up without their biological father, but doctors on the frontline of the Zika outbreak say they are concerned about how many mothers of babies with microcephaly are being abandoned. With the health service already under strain, abortion prohibited, and the virus hitting the poorest hardest, an absent father is yet another burden on mothers already struggling to cope with raising a child that might never walk or talk. At a specialized microcephaly clinic in Campina Grande, psychologist Jacqueline Loureiro works with mothers to help them cope with stress and trauma. Of the 41 women she counsels, she says only 10 receive adequate financial or emotional support from their partners. “At first many of the women say they have a partner, but as you get to know them better you realize the father is never around and the baby and mother have effectively been abandoned,” Loureiro said. Loureiro blames Brazil’s macho culture, which she says is particularly strong in the northeast. Gender roles are strictly defined and women still tend to care for the baby and look after the household. The added burden of having a child with microcephaly strains this dynamic, says  Loureiro, and often the man ends up leaving or refusing to help. Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether it actually causes microcephaly in babies. Brazil said it has confirmed 745 cases of microcephaly since October, and considers most of them related to Zika infections in the mothers. It is investigating another 4,230 cases of suspected microcephaly. Until the World Health Organization declared Zika a global health emergency last month, there was little interest in microcephaly and no data for its toll on parents. But studies into children with other special needs shows it substantially increases the chance of marital breakdown. Jennifer Lewis, who runs the U.S. based Microcephaly Foundation and has a 12-year-old daughter with the condition, is not surprised fathers in northeast Brazil are abandoning partners and children. Her charity has a network of around 5,000 families and she says the majority are single mothers. “I see single mothers all the time, where the fathers have left, the fathers have got scared. I even see married couples where the father has pretty much nothing to do with the child,” she said in a phone interview from Phoenix, Arizona. Campina Grande’s health secretary, Luzia Pinto, told Reuters the city is planning to provide housing for mothers and children with microcephaly through a government housing program in order to help with the crisis. She also ensured a psychologist was hired at the clinic to offer support. Few Brazilian jobs give enough flexibility for parents to better share the responsibility of looking after a child with special needs. This is made even more difficult as parents must often travel for hours to visit the few specialized clinics operating in Brazil. At the clinic in Campina Grande, 20-year-old Rogerio dos Santos is one of only two fathers present. Standing in the whitewashed corridor, he says he’s shocked by the tales of fathers abandoning their children but says it has been hard to get time off at the gas station where he works. For fathers like dos Santos, the support network in Brazil is lacking. Whereas the clinic runs a support group for the mothers, there is no specific help offered for fathers. “There is a certain amount of fatalism about fathers leaving, unfortunately,” said Gary Barker, who promotes gender equality though ProMundo, an organization he founded in Rio de Janeiro 19 years ago and which now works in four countries. For Barker, the health sector needs to offer support specifically for men. “There needs to be an understanding that a baby being born with microcephaly is an event that is going to increase the chance the father’s not going to stick around and he’s going to need some extra hand holding,” he said. In the small town of Algodao de Jandaira, an hour from Campina Grande, Josemary da Silva pours a cold bath to relieve her son Gilberto from the relentless heat. The five-month-old baby with microcephaly stops crying briefly as he is washed in a pale blue plastic tub. The father, after whom Gilberto is named, first saw his son one month after he was born and has rarely visited since. Two months ago he stopped contributing the $30 a month he had paid to help da Silva care for the child. “He says he loves him. But what kind of love is this,” she says as Gilberto starts to cry again.",0
"In April 2019, the Zambian Observer reported that a nurse/midwife suffering from terminal cancer had purportedly made a shocking end-of-life confession. During her 1983-95 tenure in the maternity ward at University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in the Zambian capital city of Lusaka, the nurse supposedly confessed, she “swapped close to 5000 babies” and gave them to the “wrong” parents (i.e., persons other than the children’s biological parents) “for fun”:  “May God Forgive me for my sins”, says a UTH Nurse” “I used to swap babies at UTH for fun”!, she confessed in her sick bed. “I have terminal cancer and I know I will be dying soon. I wish to confess my sins before God and before all the affected people especially those who were giving birth at UTH during my service. I have found God, Ia, now born again. I have nothing to hide, In the 12 years I worked in the maternity ward at UTH, I swapped close to 5000 babies”, she said. “If you were born in UTH between the years 1983 to 1995 chances are your parents may not be your biological parents. I had developed a habbit of swapping newly born babies just for fun. So take a good look at your siblings, if for example everyone is light and you are darkie … you are that child and I am really sorry for that” “I know I sinned against God and may he forgve me for that. I am also asking Zambians to forgive me for the evil things I was doing to innocent children. I have caused some faithful couples to divorce after going for DNA Tests. Its now that I have realised I was just being used by a demon to do that. I have causeed many mothers to breastfeed children who are not theirs biologically. I dont want to go to Hell for that, Am really sorry I have sinned alot. Please FORGIVE me”, said Sister Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa. Many readers wrote the article off as an obvious joke, expressing extreme skepticism about the premise of the story and its notion that so many babies could have been switched at birth over an extended period of time (a rate of about one infant a day, every day, for thirteen years) without many parents having raised an issue with hospital administrators — especially if, as claimed, the results of the midwife’s “fun” pranking had caused “multiple couples to divorce after going for DNA tests.”   Nonetheless, according to the Lusaka Times, local officials took the report seriously enough that an investigation was conducted by the  General Nursing Council of Zambia, who turned up no nurse matching the name of the one cited in the  Zambian Observer article:  Preliminary investigations into reports that about 5000 babies where swapped at the UTH between 1983 and 1995 have reviewed that there is no midwife in the General Nursing Council of Zambia Register by the name of Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa. The investigation has also revealed that no midwife by that name ever existed and later on worked in maternity ward at the University Teaching Hospitals. GNC Manager Regulation and Compliance and Spokesperson Thom Yung’ana said the investigation into the matter will help to verify the authenticity of the report and has called for calm among stakeholders as investigations continue in the matter. The Zambian Observer then unironically reported on that debunking of their own article. Aside from the rather incredible nature of the claim, and the fact that the Zambian Observer is a generally unreliable source, we note that that five days later the website used the very same purported photograph of nurse “Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa” to accompany an article about a mistaken swap of a single pair of newborn babies at a different hospital in Zambia (Ndola Teaching Hospital) — yet that picture had previously appeared in the blog of Ma Sedaye, who is described as a Zimbabwean woman now living in Columbus, Ohio:",1
"There was no discussion of costs. The article does refer to an editorial that accompanied the paper. The editorial observed that women would be spared “unnecessary surgery.”  Less surgery should result in lower costs for the patient. The potential benefits were included in the article. The “five-year ‘disease free’ survival rate was 83.9%…” for women who did not have the more aggressive surgery “…compared with 82.2% in those who did…”  Because full axillary lymph node dissection did not decrease mortality or decrease disease free survival, this may no longer be the standard recommendation. The article accurately reported that the study found no benefit for the more aggressive full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) among the 900 women studied with T1 or T2 breast cancer. Because ALND poses risk of infection and lymphedema, more patients would be harmed by continuing the currently recommended treatment. While the article mentions the potential complications of ALND, it does not quantify the incidence of infection or of lymphedema after ALND. Women should be told how often this occurs. The article did not indicate that this study was a randomized trial. The article should have noted that the trial was stopped early, after five years, at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee because 20 years of follow-up would have been needed to observe 500 deaths as originally planned. Because breast cancer is often diagnosed at an early stage, some doctors & patients prefer longer term follow-up than five years. The article also did not include limitations of the study as reported by the researchers. Possible limitations mentioned by the researchers were failure to achieve the originally planned accrual of 1900 patients and possible randomization imbalance favoring the group that had only the sentinel lymph node dissection. This is worth noting. There was no disease mongering. The article included quotes from an editorial accompanying the study and from an independent source at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. While the article did mention that the study was funded by the federal government, it would have been helpful for readers to know that it was funded by the National Cancer Institute. The less extensive sentinel lymph node dissection surgery is clearly compared with the currently recommended axillary lymph node surgery. The article points out that the more extensive surgery did not have a mortality or disease-free survival benefit. We’ll address the following concern under this criterion because we’re not sure where else to address it. Readers would have benefited from early clarity that all participants in the study still had a sentinel lymph node biopsy and that the research focused on whether removal of all lymph nodes was necessary if the sentinel nodes were cancerous. The article pointed out that if breast cancer has spread to any lymph nodes, doctors usually recommend removing all lymph nodes in the arm. The article reported that in a phone interview, Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology said the group may revise its recommendations for full lymph node removal based on the results of this study. Since many surgeons and oncologists base their advise to patients on these recommendations, patients may soon be offered this less extensive surgery option. . The novelty of the study results were supported by quotes from an editorial that accompanied the study. The editorial referred to the study as an “important contribution” and noted the study provided “strong evidence” that many women can safely forgo complete lymph node removal. A representative of the American Society of Clinical Oncology characterized the study as “practice-changing” and thought the findings will probably prompt ASCO to revise its recommendations for breast cancer patients with T1 or T2 tumors who have positive sentinel lymph nodes. The article includes information from a telephone interview with Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology which recommends surgery and treatment options for patients. And it includes comments from editorial authors.",0
"Real computer viruses have been tied to email postcards in the past, but there weren’t any new threats or viruses identified by McAfee or Norton when the warning began circulating again in May 2017. Postcard virus warnings that have made the rounds on social media since the early 2000s. There are many different versions, but they all have a few similar traits: McAfee or Norton has just identified the postcard virus, it has been deemed as the most destructive ever, the virus destroys hard drives and can send itself to everyone in your email address book. It’s not clear where the postcard virus warning started, but it’s earliest versions date back to 2001. There have been a number of credible email postcard virus warning threats over the years. McAfee issued consumer virus alerts about a postcard phishing scam in 2005 and about a postcard virus worm in 2001. The postcard warning appears to be based on the 2001 threat alert, which explains that the “worm virus” could be spread via email and had been know to self-replicate and spread to other systems, just like in the postcard warnings: By July 2007, the virus warning had evolved. Now, instead of “a virtual card for you” appearing int he subject line, the term “postcard” was used instead. Some versions, like this one, actually used the phrase “Hallmark postcard” and included many of the old, and previously debunked, warnings: You should be alert during the next few days.. Do not open any message with an attachment entitled ‘POSTCARD FROM HALLMARK,’ regardless of who sent it to you.. It is a virus which opens A POSTCARD IMAGE, which ‘burns’ the whole hard disc C of your computer. This virus will be received from someone who has your e-mail address in his/her contact list. This is the reason why you need to send this e-mail to all your contacts It is better to receive this message 25 times than to receive the virus and open it. These Hallmark postcard versions of the rumor went viral again in 2010, and in 2017. However, there was no indication that there were any credible threats at the time — and the claim that McAfee and/or Norton had deemed the virus the most destructive ever are false. Aside from a a virus warning from 2001 that matched some, but not all, of the postcard virus warning’s particulars. That’s why we’re calling this one “mostly fiction.” It is important, however, to always be vigilant about viruses that are spread via email. Scanning attachments before they’re downloaded, avoiding emails from unfamiliar senders, and never providing personal information via email are just a few recommendations.

"The article discussed that Medicare covers the treatment at $450 for a two-hour session. There wasn’t a discussion about whether other insurance programs covered the treatment. It would have been helpful to know how much the entire treatment plan for the profiled patient cost and whether it was covered by his insurance. The article was about one patient’s subjective account of pain relief. The only mention of evidence is by one of the doctors quoted, saying he did a literature search and found the evidence supporting this treatment to be “grim.” A quantitative assessment of that evidence would have been useful to include. Although the article mentioned overuse of the treatment, there wasn’t an explicit mention of the type of harms associated with using hyperbaric therapy. The article cautioned about the lack of evidence and rigorous medical studies supporting the use of hyperbaric chamber therapy outside of common uses (e.g., decompression sickness, burn healing). The article also mentioned how the results seen with the patient profiled are not commonly seen in patients with chronic late radiation effects. The article did not commit disease mongering. It highlights the story of a desperate patient in a balanced way. Besides the one reference to Kaiser Health News, all the sources had connections to the patient. The article mentioned physical therapy and pain medication as standard treatment for delayed radiation effects on muscles and joints. It did a good job describing how challenging it can be to manage. The article mentioned hyperbaric chambers are located in about 1,400 hospitals across the US. Given that Medicare also reimburses for hyperbaric therapy, access is probably relatively easy. The article described that this is not a novel procedure and that hyperbaric therapy has been around since the 1900s. It does not appear this story relied on a news release.",0
"The release does not mention costs. We would have liked some context. What kind of rehabilitation costs are associated with the severe lifelong swallowing side effects that are mitigated by the reduction in dose discussed in the study? The release did include some quantification of benefits, but we would have liked a bit more. Here is what was provided: “The study…showed that patients treated with reduced radiation had less difficulty swallowing solids (40 percent versus 89 percent of patients treated with standard doses of radiation) or impaired nutrition (10 percent versus 44 percent of patients treated with regular doses of radiation.” The release would have been improved with a discussion of how “less difficulty” and “impaired nutrition” were measured. The published paper makes it clear that the swallowing difficulties and nutritional impairment were self-reported using a questionaire of some kind. This also would have been useful information to include in the release. The release does not quantify whether there is any reduction in progression-free survival or “cure” rate with reduced radiation. The release also does not quantify what is meant by the words “reduced radiation.” Is it half of normal doses, or reduced frequency but the same dose? There may be potential harms in reducing a therapy aimed at a cure, but the release does not address this except in vague terms: “We found there are some patients have very high cure rates with reduced doses of radiation,” said Barbara Burtness, MD, Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology), Yale Cancer Center, Disease Research Team Leader for the Head and Neck Cancers Program at Smilow Cancer Hospital, and the chair of the ECOG-ACRIN head and neck committee. “Radiation dose reduction resulted in significantly improved swallowing and nutritional status,” she said. The release provides some information about the study and how it was conducted. And it does note that “patients who had a history of smoking less than 10 packs of cigarettes a year had a very high disease control compared with heavy smokers.” But it does not mention that this is a stage 2 study and that the number of patients (80) is very small as medical trials go. The published study notes that “This finding provides justification for further study of radiation deintensification but requires validation in a larger comparative trial.” That limitation should have been included in the release. There was no disease mongering. The release failed to mention any funding source or the presence or absence of a conflict for researchers. The published study notes that the research was supported by US Public Health Service grants, the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and the US Department of Health and Human Services. An author quoted in the release disclosed consulting and other financial relationships with seven pharmaceutical companies but no radiation device manufacturers. The release summarizes a study that compares low dose and high dose radiation, and notes that chemotherapy was also part of the treatment regimen for the patients. It states that all of the patient volunteers were candidates for surgery, which is another alternative or adjunct therapy for these types of cancers. The issue of availability of reduced dosages doesn’t apply here. The release makes no claim of novelty other than it is a “new clinical trial.” It might be assumed that low dose radiation is novel because it is not standard for these types of cancers but there is no way to know this from either the release or the published study. A brief online search revealed that a partnering institution issued a related news release on low dose radiation research in HPV-positive head and neck cancers in 2014. The release doesn’t rely on sensational language but the frequent use of the term “cure” seems misleading, especially when we aren’t provided specifics on the treatment outcomes. These cancers can certainly recur after treatment, so how did the researchers establish whether patients were cured or not?",1
"Lu Zhihao, 4, kicks a ball at a basketball court in Foshan, Guangdong province March 28, 2011. REUTERS/Joe Tan “I want to be superman,” said the toddler, a typically cheeky kid, but one scaling in at over 60 kg (132.3 lb), around five times the weight of an average boy his age. With puffed cheeks puckering up his eyes and mouth, folds of flesh like a miniature Michelin man and heavily bowed legs, the one-meter (yard) tall toddler’s condition is suspected to be partly the result of a hormone imbalance given his height. His loud and frequent demands for food, however, are often met by his accommodating parents and a constant stream of visitors to their lively courtyard home. “Yum, yum, yum, yum. I like to eat fish,” he said, grinning with his mouth full at dinner time as he wolfed down several bowls of rice and steamed fish. With China’s coastal cities booming amid rampant urbanization and industrialization, a new, more affluent generation of middle class families have been raising more and more pampered children like Lu Zhihao, bringing a growing blight of obesity to Chinese society. “Little more than 20 years ago many people, even in China’s richest cities, were struggling to feed themselves; now they are struggling to lose weight,” wrote Paul French and Matthew Crabbe in their recent book “Fat China: How expanding waistlines are Changing a Nation.”   “The combination of rising incomes, greater longevity and the one-child policy meant that the “six pocket” phenomenon appeared with each child having richer parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles - all keen to spoil them.”   Some experts describe this as the “Little Emperor” syndrome, exacerbated by the country’s controversial one-child policy since the 1970s to control a swelling population expected to hit 1.65 billion in 2033. Hardly any high street in Chinese towns and cities now are without a McDonald’s or Kentucky Fried Chicken, and smoking rates are amongst the highest in the world as the country rapidly develops and its economy sky-rockets. “Obesity is a problem for the wealthy, newly emergent middle-class consumers,” wrote French and Crabbe. Zhihao’s mother Chen Huan admitted he throws tantrums when he’s denied food, as the toddler sulked on a sofa after he was refused a pack of biscuits after dinner. “He has difficulty moving up and down stairs. He needs help getting on the bus that takes him to the childcare center. It’s also difficult to bathe him because of the rolls of fat,” said Chen, who works as a factory worker in the Pearl River Delta. “Of course I worry about him. Basically his legs can’t support his weight ... His heart is also under pressure because of the heavy load,” said Zhihao’s father, Lu Yuncheng, who works on a fish farm. A 2008 Chinese National Task Force on Childhood Obesity found that almost one in five children under seven are overweight in China, and more than seven percent are obese.",0
"""California voters added to what are considered the nation’s strongest gun control laws on Election Day by approving Proposition 63. The measure imposes background checks on ammunition sales; bans possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines; and forces owners to give up their weapons as soon as they can no longer legally possess them. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, helped author the initiative and led the campaign for it. The measure had received nearly 63 percent approval as of mid-November, with some votes still uncounted. In a press conference the day after Prop 63 passed, Newsom made several claims about the effectiveness of California’s gun restrictions. """"We have significantly reduced the gun-murder rate because of our progressive gun policy,"""" Newsom said, adding that California has seen a """"56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since we started to step up and step in and lead the nation in common sense gun safety laws, background checks, restricting large-capacity clips and the like."""" Gavin Newsom makes his claim about California's gun murder rate at about the 6:30 minute mark in the video above. We decided to focus on Newsom’s claim that California has seen a """"56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"""" since it began imposing tough gun laws in the 1990s. Whether those gun laws are the driving force behind such a drop is a matter of mixed opinion. Gun rights groups say tougher criminal penalties, not gun laws, have led to the decline. PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions or opinions. A Glock 30SF .45 Auto semi-automatic pistol with a Glock 13-round extension magazine installed, and 13 rounds of hollow-point ammunition are seen in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our research The gun murder rate measures the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 residents in a geographical area. A separate measurement, the gun death rate, takes a broader look including homicides, suicides and accidental shooting deaths. Based on our research and contact with Newsom’s campaign spokesman, it appears the lieutenant governor mixed up the two rates and ended up understating the drop in California’s gun murder rate by more than 10 percentage points. The state’s gun death rate -- not the gun murder rate -- dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013, according to figures provided by Ari Freilich, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention. The attorney cited age-adjusted data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nonprofit law center advocates for gun control laws and is considered an authority on gun crime statistics. The law center’s figures do not include data from 2014, a year in which gun deaths and gun homicides continued to fall in California. Nor do they include statistics from 2015 and 2016, which are not yet available. Still, the 20-year span is the approximate period during which California imposed strict new gun laws, spurred by mass shootings years earlier on a Stockton schoolyard and inside a San Francisco law office. This meant the rate of deaths by any kind of shooting declined from 17.48 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 7.68 per 100,000 residents. Larger drop in gun murder rate During this same period, California’s gun murder rate declined even faster: By 65 percent, according to a review of the CDC’s fatal injury reports by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent. Data from these reports have been cited by both gun control and gun rights groups to describe California’s decline in gun violence. They show gun murders fell from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 (when 1,233 were killed) compared with 1993 (when 3,183 were killed). Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during much of the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people, according to a Pew Research analysis in 2015 of available federal data. Since then, Pew reported, the rate has remained relatively flat. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has seen a """"56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"""" since it enacted strong gun control laws in the 1990s. Newsom appears to have mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. California’s gun murder rate dropped 67 percent between 1993 and 2014, according to a review of fatal injury report data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A similar, though somewhat smaller, drop in the gun murder rate took place nationwide during this period. Newsom’s overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws. We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this. What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated. His claim needs this key clarification. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"On 5 June 2017, the Red State Watcher web site posted two articles featuring a video that appeared to show Londoners chanting U.S. President Donald Trump’s name in the aftermath of a terrorist attack in the city two days earlier, which left at least victims dead, as well as the three attackers. One article carried the headline “Wow! Londoners chant President Trump’s name instead of mayor,” and another was headlined “Sadiq Khan May Be In Trouble – Look What Londoners Are Doing!”   That story went on to claim: Londoners are fed up [with] Sadiq’s [sic] Khan’s soft stance on terrorism. As British citizens die, Kahn [sic] tells the public “not to be alarm.” [sic] This did not settle well with some citizens. Some Londoners took [to] the streets and instead of chanting Khan’s name, they chanted Donald Trump’s. Both stories included the following video: Sadiq Khan is an EMBARRASSMENT ? Londoners chant #Trump‘s name instead of hispic.twitter.com/flBWoTEKGN@realDonaldTrump #MAGA #LondonBridge — Boca Vista (@bocavista2016) June 5, 2017  The articles, the posting of the video, and the text that accompanied it – which labelled London Mayor Sadiq Khan an “embarrassment” – all came in the context of a high-profile dispute between Khan and Trump. The morning after the attack, Trump grossly misrepresented comments made by Khan, claiming that the London Mayor had told the people of the British capital there was “no reason to be alarmed” at the attack. In fact, Khan was referring specifically to increased police patrols on the streets of London, and reassuring its residents not to be unduly concerned by that escalation. A spokesperson for the London Mayor then issued a statement calling Trump’s tweet “ill-informed” and accusing him of deliberately taking Khan’s comments out of context. The following day, Trump doubled down on his attack, saying the mayor’s explanation of his remarks – which was accurate – was a “pathetic excuse.” Contrary to what the Red State Watcher articles implied, however, the video had nothing to do with that dispute, or with the June 2017 terrorist attack. In fact, Paul Golding, leader of the right-wing extremist group Britain First, shot the video in March 2017:   London today! “DONALD TRUMP WE LOVE YOU!” pic.twitter.com/AOryV4RtND — Paul Golding (@GoldingBF) March 18, 2017  The video shows a small group of far-right activists engaged in a counter-protest at a much larger anti-racism rally in London on 18 March, at which demonstrators carried signs saying “Stand up to Trump.” It’s possible some of those chanting in favor of the US President are from London – Paul Golding himself is from the British capital – but the video does not show a spontaneous assembly of non-aligned Londoners favoring Donald Trump over Sadiq Khan in their dispute, following a 3 June 2017 terrorist attack in the city.",1
"""Via Twitter, the president of the anti-abortion Texans for Life Coalition made this claim Dec. 6, 2011: """"Murder #1 cause of death for pg women,"""" meaning pregnant women. """"Tragic."""" Kyleen Wright’s message pointed Twitter followers to a Houston Chronicle news article published that day about a Houston man charged with capital murder in the August 2010 stabbing death of a pregnant woman. Investigators had discovered records of calls and text messages between the man and the woman, the story says, indicating that he thought he was the unborn child's father and wanted her to have an abortion but that she had refused. We asked Wright to elaborate on murder being the primary cause of death for pregnant women. By email, she replied: """"This is a story that keeps popping up. ... It’s the top cause, it’s one of the top causes, and then there will be the occasional story denying it’s a top cause."""" Wright guided us to an Oct. 26, 2011, Reuters news article about a study concluding that about three of every 100,000 women who are pregnant or have a child less than 1 year old are murdered and two of every 100,000 kill themselves, with roughly half of the women who died violently having had some sort of conflict with current or former partners. That facet, the story says, prompted experts to call for more thorough screening and follow-up for domestic problems during pregnancy check-ups. In the November 2011, issue of the Obstetrics & Gynecology medical journal, the researchers summed up: """"Pregnancy-associated homicide and suicide each account for more deaths"""" than obstetric complications """"including hemorrhage, obstetric embolism or preeclampsia and eclampsia."""" That’s not quite saying murder is the prime killer of pregnant women. Rather, the study suggests that homicide accounts for more deaths than specific individual complications of pregnancy. The study says the researchers determined that there were two suicides and 2.9 homicides among pregnant or postpartum mothers for every 100,000 live births from 2003 through 2007. Over the years, the study says, rates of death due to cardiac disease, infection and hemorrhage and other such medical causes have decreased but maternal mortality due to injury has remained constant. """"Homicide and suicide are two important and potentially preventable causes of maternal injury,"""" the study says. In an interview, the study’s lead researcher, Christie Palladino, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Georgia Health Sciences University, pointed us to a 2010 study led by Cynthia Berg of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating that from 1998 through 2005, the U.S. death rate of women from all pregnancy-related complications was 14.5 per 100,000 live births. The study was described in the December 2010 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Palladino told us that her study’s figures on slain pregnant and postpartum women were drawn from the National Violent Death Reporting System, a federal database including all records of violent deaths in 16 participating states. She noted that compared to the 2.9 homicides of pregnant and postpartum women per 100,000 live births, other research has found that 1.81 pregnant and postpartum women per 100,0000 live births die from hemorrhage, with fewer pregnant women dying from other causes associated with pregnancy, including cardiovascular conditions, thrombotic pulmonary embolisms, hypertensive disorders, infections, cardiomyopathy and amniotic fluid embolisms. Then again, Palladino said, her team’s study did not look into all possible causes of death for pregnant women; car wrecks, for example, were not included. By email, Palladino said that """"while we can't say that homicide is THE #1 cause (of) pregnancy-associated mortality, our data when compared to other data on maternal mortality"""" points to the fact that homicide and suicide are """"among the leading causes of pregnancy-associated deaths."""" Palladino also provided a federal study, published in 2005, concluding that the murder rate for pregnant and postpartum women was 1.7 per 100,000 live births. Murder risk factors for mothers, the federal study says, include being younger than 20, being African American and having late or no prenatal care. """"Homicide,"""" the authors wrote in the March 2005 issue of the American Journal of Public Health, """"is a leading cause of pregnancy-associated injury deaths."""" But it’s not the leading cause, according to the 2005 study. The study drew on information covering 1991 through 1999 in the nation’s Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, which was established in 1987 to collect data on all reported deaths that occurred during pregnancy or within a year of pregnancy. And of all the period’s 7,342 reported deaths of women (some of which occurred more than a year after the woman gave birth), 4,200 were due to medical complications during pregnancy or a year afterward. Nearly 880 of the deaths occurred due to motor vehicle accidents and 617 women were murdered, the study says, and unintentional injuries, suicides and other causes accounted for nearly 500 deaths. In this review, then, murder trailed vehicle accidents and medical complications as a cause of death. Additional perspective may be in order, the researchers indicated, in that the prevalence of homicides involving pregnant and postpartum women is """"similar to national statistics on homicide among all women of reproductive age (regardless of whether they are pregnant or not)."""" In 1999, the study says, homicide was the third-leading cause of injury-related death for all U.S. women (pregnant or not pregnant) of reproductive age, 15 to 44 years of age, after deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents and suicide. For such women in 2008, the latest year of available data, homicide ranked behind motor vehicle accidents, poisonings, malignant tumors, suicides, poisonings and heart disease among causes of death, our check of a CDC database indicates. We’re ready to rule. The Palladino study, suggesting more pregnant and postpartum women die from murder than any single medical complication, gives Wright’s claim an element of truth. But murder trails medical complications combined as a cause of death and it’s also behind vehicle wrecks. Wright’s statement is .""",1
"As teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg found herself in the global spotlight in September 2019, climate-change deniers sought to discredit her with a series of false rumors and doctored photographs. Perhaps the most preposterous of these claims was that Thunberg was actually an Australian actress named Estella Renee who was delivering speeches on environmental issues not because she was concerned about the planet, but because she was a deep state crisis actor and paid to shill. While researching this article we found at least three variations of the “Greta Thunberg is an actress” claim. They are as follows: We’ll take a deeper look at each of these items individually. Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee? Several social media users have claimed that Thunberg is actually an Australian actress named Estelle Renee. Facebook user Jack A. Schulman, for instance, wrote: Aspiring Actress impersonates crying child climate activist at UN, impersonator is a sham. Screams “How dare you!” from acting class. Estella Renee is a very talented shakespearian actress from Australia. She can do Scandinavian accents. She can break down and cry. She can scream “How dare you!”. She deserves an Academy Award not a Nobel for impersonating Heidi looking Greta Thunberg, a fictional Character before the UN yesterday, a fake climate activist, a child actor age 15 and 1/2 screaming “How dare you!” straight out of ” Streetcar named Desire! “. Otherwise, she’s a sham and a fraud! Her publicist refused to respond to our calls, but NY customs identified her as Estrella Renee, here “to see the sights” at her entry from Australia. Her adult accompaniment signed her into her hotel room as Greta Thungren, but we confirmed she is Estelle Renee. We turned over her illegal false identity to DHS who has confirmed her dual identity, but is still investigating. They are not sure impersonation is a crime. Yet, what a fraud!! This claim is nonsensical. Thunberg didn’t appear out of thin air in September 2019 to deliver a speech to the United Nations. She’s been on the public radar since at least September 2018 when she started staging climate protests in Sweden. Thunberg has also been nominated for numerous awards (including the Nobel Peace Prize), has met with several world leaders, and took a highly publicized voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, we know the identity of Thunberg’s parents, Svante Thunberg and Malena Ernman, as well as her grandfather, Olof Thunberg, and her sister, Beata. In other words, Greta Thunberg is not a “fictional character.” Her journey to becoming a global environmental activist has been well documented. Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page. Is this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous? A slightly less far-fetched version of this claim holds that Thunberg is listed as an “actress” on her IMDB page. While this is true, many have shared this screenshot as if it was somehow damaging to Thunberg’s reputation as an environmental activist: Thunberg has one acting credit to her name. She lent her voice to a short film titled “Ave Paraíso” that was released in Spain in 2019. The remainder of her IMDB page simply lists appearances she’s made on television programs (such as “The Daily Show”) or in environmental documentaries where she is credited as herself. The fact that Thunberg has an IMDB page is often shared along with the insinuation that her environmental beliefs are not sincere. However, it should be noted that being an actor does not automatically disqualify someone from having an opinion, being an activist, or having a political career. Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance, often lends his voice to environmental causes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan were both actors before embarking on political careers. Even U.S. President Donald Trump is listed as an “actor” on his IMDB page:  The website Michael Smith News noted one additional detail about Thunberg’s IMDB page that seemingly hinted at the notion that she was a paid actress looking for new gigs. The website wrote that “you can talk to her agent if you’d like to book her for acting work” and then linked to an IMDB Pro link. However, it doesn’t appear that Michael Smith News has access to IMDB Pro. When we checked Greta’s listing on IMDB Pro, we found no listing for Thunberg’s alleged agent. Does the viral video of a young climate protester crying feature actress Estelle Renee? Thunberg wasn’t the only environmental activist to be accused of being an actor. The websites TeaParty.org, The Gateway Pundit, Joe for America, and the aforementioned Michael Smith News all published articles about how it was “all a hoax” and that the “little girl seen crying in viral video” at the Global Warming rally was really a child actress, “a prop for the left,” named Estelle Renee: The international left used innocent children last weekend to push their climate change extremism. Tens of thousands of children were let out of school so they could go protest against capitalism and global warming. As we reported on Monday — One terrified little girl in Australia couldn’t even talk to reporters about climate change without crying… …But that was not your typical emotional teen. The girl in the video is an Aussie child actress. These articles are referring to a viral video from May 2019 of a young protester who broke down in tears while talking to reporters about climate change. The video in question can be seen in the second of the following tweets: This young girl is so terrified about “climate change” she can’t even speak to a journalist about her fears without breaking down in tears. So sad. The Marxists have gotten their hands on our children and we have allowed it to happen.#ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/YN2xAjGvIj — Oh boy what a shot (@ohboywhatashot) September 20, 2019  The young protester in this video, whose real name is Estella Brasier, does have a profile on the talent website Star Now. However, these websites provided no evidence that this person was paid to appear at this protest or to “act” that they were concerned about the environment. And as we noted above, the fact that a person has acted or is an actor does not disqualify them from having personal beliefs. Brasier’s father spoke to Maarten Schenk of the debunking website LeadStories about this rumor: The events of that day are in the public domain and were on every TV station. The ideas and concerns expressed by Estella depicted in that video are entirely genuine, not paid for, she was not acting… …Estella was not expecting to be interviewed by the media that day: it could have been her, it could have been anyone else. She was just standing closest to the cameras.",1
"Keanu Reeves didn’t write an inspirational open letter about life and loss that went viral on social media sites. The open letter went viral after it appeared at Keanu Reeves Online, an unofficial Facebook fan page for the actor, on November 21, 2015. In the letter, Keanu Reeves (supposedly) writes about his early life, living with dyslexia and losing the woman that he loved: “Most people know me, but don’t know my story. At the age of 3, I watched my father leave. I attended four different high schools and struggled with dyslexia, making my education more challenging than it is for most. At the age of 23, my closest friend River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. In 1998, I met Jennifer Syme. We fell instantly in love and by 1999, Jennifer was pregnant with our daughter. Sadly, after eight months, our child was born stillborn. We were devastated by her death and it eventually ended our relationship. 18 months later, Jennifer died in a car accident. Since then I avoid serious relationships and having kids. My younger sister had lukemia. Today she is cured, and I donated 70% of my gains from the movie Matrix to Hospitals that treat leukemia. I am one of the only Hollywood stars without a Mansion. I don’t have any bodyguards and do not wear fancy clothes. And even though I’m worth $100 million, I still ride the subway and I love it! The inspirational open letter about Keanu Reeves’ life quickly went viral. That’s due in large part to the fact that many people think Keanu Reeves Online is the actor’s official Facebook page, but that’s not the case. The page clearly states that it’s in no way linked to Keanu Reeves: This is a Keanu Reeves Fan Page. We are not associated with the real Keanu Reeves in any way. We just quote what we read and spread positivity. Keanu Reeves Online posts a lot of pictures of Keanu Reeves and inspirational or positive messages about life. These messages often appear in quotation marks and don’t list an author, so it’s easy to assume that the passages were written or spoken by Keanu Reeves. In reality, Keanu Reeves has refused to talk about his personal life, so him writing an unprompted open letter about his biggest struggles would have been very unusual. A Keanu Reeves profile that appeared in the magazine Details in 2008 touches on the actor’s refusal to talk about his personal life: He remains stoic in his refusal to talk about his personal life. (There are reasons to remain stoic. In 1999 he lost a daughter with his girlfriend, actress Jennifer Syme; the baby was stillborn. Almost two years later Syme died in a car accident in Los Angeles. To ask him about these things would seem merely cruel.) Later in the day Keanu notices the query GIRLFRIEND? scribbled on a page of my legal pad. He answers, politely and preemptively, like this: “No.” “No you don’t have a girlfriend or no you don’t want to get into it?” “No,” he says. “All of its implications.” There have been a number of celebrity pranks similar to this one. It was falsely reported that Richard Gere gave food and $100 to every homeless person in New York, and that Jennifer Anniston donated food and clothes to a homeless single mom who she met on the street. These hoaxes could be simply designed to draw a response from celebrities, or to make celebrities “look bad” when they debunk rumors about their over-the-top kindness. So, the inspirational open letter that appeared at Keanu Reeves Online covers actual events from the actor’s life, but it wasn’t actually written by Keanu Reeves. At this point, the letter’s actual author isn’t known. Comments",1
"In September 2019, a Reddit r/todayilearned post claimed that luxury watch manufacturer Rolex maintained such “meticulous” sales records that their data was used to solve an open homicide:TIL of The Rolex Murder. On July 28, 1996, a man’s body washed up on a trawler in the UK seas. There was no identification on the body except a 25-year-old Rolex Oyster on his wrist. As Rolex maintains such meticulous service records, they were able to ID the victim and ultimately the murderer. from todayilearnedReddit’s r/todayilearned (usually abbreviated “TIL“) is a subreddit for users to share interesting facts and stories, and the Rolex murder story was highly upvoted. On October 4 2019, the story was reposted in a visual format to Reddit’s image-hosting sister-site Imgur (titled “Timely findings”):Timely findingsA meme with the header “Diply FACTS!! !” featured an image of a blue-faced Rolex (“not the actual image”) and text at the bottom:On July 28, 1996, a man’s body washed up on a trawler in the UK seas. There was no identification on the body except a 25-year-old Rolex Oyster on his wrist. As Rolex maintains such meticulous service records, they were able to ID the victim and ultimately the murderer.The “Diply Facts” page shared the image to their Facebook page on October 3 2019. It likely sourced its claim from the popular Reddit post several days earlier, but didn’t mark its source on the meme.As is often the case with r/todayilearned posts, the original poster selected the option to link to an article rather than appending a text-based summary of the post. They shared an article from which the description of Rolex’s “meticulous records” was apparently sourced:On July 28, 1996, a man’s body was found in the net of the Brixham trawler Malkerry six miles off Teignmouth.Detectives found nothing on the body to indicate who the drowned man was. Their only clue was a 25-year-old Rolex Oyster watch which was still attached to his right wrist.Six weeks later, after researching Rolex’s meticulous service records, officers established that the victim was 51-year-old former soldier Ronald Platt.The serial number and service documents showed the timepiece had twice been taken by Mr Platt to a firm of Harrogate jewellers in the 1980s.In its original format on Reddit, the post’s title adequately and accurately summarized the initial details of the story. The body of Ronald Platt was located by a British trawler on July 28 1996, and UK police used the watch’s serial number as a means of identifying the victim. British news organizations reported that “fugitive Canadian businessman Albert Walker” was convicted of Walker’s murder in 1998, and described a complicated series of events which began when Walker fled his native Canada.According to the September 2017 article (which was updated in September 2019), Walker first influenced Platt and Platt’s partner to relocate to Canada. But Platt moved back to England in 1995, disrupting Walker’s efforts to remain undetected:Just weeks before the Canadian authorities began investigating the alleged theft of nearly $4 million Canadian from his financial services business, Walker had fled across the Atlantic to London with his 15-year-old daughter in December 1990 … [After stealing the identity of another man, Walker] he befriended mild-mannered TV repairman Ronald Platt and his 39-year-old girlfriend Elaine Boyes in Harrogate where the couple unknowingly played a part in extending Walker’s web of deceit and lies.Walker used them as a front for a bogus company operation, with accounts in Switzerland, to launder cash to further his stay in Britain.When [Platt and Boyes] had served their purpose, Walker paid for them to start a new life in Canada – a country Mr Platt loved after living there in his youth – and assumed his second false identity. But when a disillusioned and jobless Mr Platt returned to Britain in 1995 he became a threat to Walker’s security and freedom.Coverage of Walker’s murder trial in 1998 described how police used Rolex service records to identify Platt and led them to Walker:Mr Platt was only identified through a Rolex Oyster watch on his wrist which bore a reference number that allowed Devon police to trace its owner: the real Ronald Platt, and subsequently his family.“The irony is that the watch was one of his proudest possessions and never left his wrist,” said Mr Barton, who added: “The person who put him on the sea-bed left it with him.”Albert Walker is the subject of pages on both Wikipedia and Murderpedia, a Wiki for “true crime” buffs; Platt’s murder was the subject of other true-crime writing. Under the heading “Murder and conviction” on Walker’s Wikipedia page, the role of his Rolex watch in the investigation is described at length. Time elapsed between Platt’s death was described in a slightly different time frame, stating the body was found “two weeks” after the murder:Walker took Platt out on a fishing trip 20 July 1996 where he murdered him, weighed him down with an anchor, and dumped his body in the sea. Two weeks later the body was discovered in the English Channel by fisherman John Copik with a Rolex wristwatch being the only identifiable object on the body. Since the Rolex movement had a serial number and was engraved with special markings every time it was serviced, British police traced the service records from Rolex. Ronald Joseph Platt was identified as the owner of the watch and the victim of the murder. In addition British police were able to determine the date of death by examining the date on the watch calendar and since the Rolex movement had a reserve of two to three days of operation when inactive and it was fully waterproof, they were able to determine the time of death within a small margin of error. Walker was apprehended shortly thereafter.The role Rolex service records played in solving the 1996 murder was also mentioned on the brand’s Wikipedia page. A source cited for the claim on Walker’s page said that the murder occurred on July 20 1996, and Platt’s body was recovered eight days later, not two weeks:The fugitive Canadian [Walker], who was number 4 on Interpol’s wanted list and feared his cover would be blown, lured Platt to Devon in southwest England on the pretext of helping him sail his boat, the Lady Jane, to Essex. Once aboard, Walker knocked Platt unconscious, tied a 4.5-kg anchor to his belt and tossed him overboard. Eight days later, a commercial fisherman scooped up the body and the anchor in a net about 10 km offshore. Police initially thought the victim had committed suicide. But after establishing Platt’s identity through the Rolex watch on his wrist, and discovering that someone else was living under his name, Devon police launched a murder investigation.Although Rolex service records provided information critical to the investigation, additional forensic and forensic accounting work enabled UK police to solve Platt’s murder. Detective Superintendent Phil Sincock headed the investigation, and he described other case elements during 2019 media interviews:“There was one bit of luck in terms of the Essex policeman going to the wrong door, but other than that it was down to painstaking police work and some new ground-breaking scientific inquiries which was why they had me over to Canada talking about them,” [Sincock] said as another film about the story was released.“We seized a whole van load of documentation from Walker’s house and among it all was a two-inch square sales receipt which showed that he had purchased on a Barclaycard an anchor … We proved that his yacht was at sea at the material time. For the first time in any case, we took the yacht’s GPS navigation system back to its manufacturers and they were able to plot co-ordinates which gave us the time and date it had been switched off and proved it had been very near to where Mr Platt’s body had been found.“Tests on the Rolex watch established it would have taken 44 hours to wind down. The watch stopped on June 22, which meant that he had died on June 20. From the GPS we could put Walker’s boat in the area on June 20.“Inside the cabin were some cushions on which we found some head hairs. DNA tests proved that they were from the deceased man. And forensic tests found zinc traces from the anchor on Mr Platt’s belt and traces of leather on the anchor.”In 2005, Walker’s daughter — who he presented as his wife during his time in England — spoke to Canadian news organizations about her father’s transfer from the UK to Canada as well as her fears for her family’s safety. As of 2013, Walker was alive and incarcerated in British Columbia.As presented on Reddit and Imgur, claims about the Rolex murder investigation and the involvement of the brand’s “meticulous records” was broadly accurate. Walker’s arrest was initially reported as resulting from police reliance on Rolex service records. In actuality, however, additional Rolex-related data involving its “wind-down” function also played a part, as did then-novel use of global positioning satellites and DNA testing on hairs found at the crime scene. But according to initial reports, Platt’s identity was indeed established via his Rolex Oyster watch.",0
"Pope Francis gave a papal honor to a pro-abortion activist Lilianne Ploumen. But the Vatican said it was given as a “diplomatic practice” and not as an endorsement of her views. BNR Newsradio, an all-news station in the Netherlands, posted a short video of Lilianne Ploumen posing with the Pontifical Medal on December 22, 2017. The video went largely unnoticed at the time. That changed, however, with a Media Research Center report that appeared on January 22. The story appeared under the headline “Pope Francis Awards Pro-Abortion Extremist Lilianne Ploumen with Pontifical Honor.” [embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMWNXAch5eM[/embedyt] The video shows Ploumen posing with the Commander in the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great medal. The recognition has two divisions, civil and military. It’s frequently given to heads of state who meet with the Pope. Ploumen serves as the minister of foreign trade and development in the Netherlands. She launched a pro-choice NGO called “She Decides” in 2017. The group aims to counter an executive order issued by President Trump that bars U.S. aid to organizations that discuss abortion as a family planning option with their clients. In an interview with the Catholic Herald on January 15,  Ploumen said, “I assume I have been granted the pontifical medal in the context of the Dutch state visit to the Vatican in June 2017. I was part of the delegation in my capacity at that time as minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands.” The Holy See Press Office confirmed that Ploumen had been given the honor as a “diplomatic practice” for heads of state in a statement to the National Catholic Register that same day: “The honor of the Pontifical Order of St. Gregory the Great received by Mrs. Lilianne Ploumen, former Minister of Development, in June 2017 during the visit of the Dutch Royals to the Holy Father, responds to the diplomatic practice of the exchange of honors between delegations on the occasion of official visits by Heads of State or Government in the Vatican. Therefore, it is not in the slightest a placet [an expression of assent] to the politics in favor of abortion and of birth control that Mrs Ploumen promotes.” So, wile it’s true that Lilliane Ploumen received a papal honor. But the Vatican maintains that it was given as a diplomatic practice, and wasn’t an endorsement of her views on abortion. Comments",0
"Cost is not discussed. Since the drug of interest—MDMA—is banned in the US as a Schedule 1 substance, cost estimates may be unreliable. But that doesn’t make some mention of cost irrelevant here. And since the drug is given along with intensive therapy, that cost also could have been discussed. The story briefly describes the results of one clinical trial, which found that slightly more than half of the 107 participants reported major reductions in PTSD symptoms. But this isn’t enough to understand the benefits. The story explained this but could have emphasized it more: The drug is proposed for use as part of an intensive therapy program, with doses of it given just a few times and with professional supervision–and not daily or chronically, as many drugs for psychiatric conditions are administered. Harms do get acknowledged, albeit rather low in the story. The story identifies existing studies as “clinical trials” but offers little explanation of what that means. More emphasis on the nature and quality of evidence would be an important addition here. We don’t know if they are randomized or controlled, nor peer reviewed, nor what the limitations are, etc. Recent and ongoing military conflicts overseas have dramatically increased the numbers of PTSD sufferers returning to the U.S., and, one independent source notes, existing drug treatments fail two thirds of those patients. One interesting thing to note on measuring how common it is: For U.S. soldiers, those with PTSD in our military get disability payments for the rest of their lives. Rates of PTSD are much less frequent in ex-British soldiers who served in the same places, and they don’t have the generous compensation system we do. We rate this a just-passing “Satisfactory.” The story could have been more overt about the funding support of an organization dedicated to ending the US government’s ban on psychedelics. A careful read of the text will allow the reader to infer that the group—the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS—is funding the clinical trials on which an FDA assessment of MDMA’s efficacy will be based. But a more overt description of that causal chain would have been helpful, as MAPS has a clear agenda. Sources and their relationship (or lack thereof) to MAPS are clearly delineated, and the story does offer contrasting views on the safety of MDMA. But it will be hard for the reader to determine where the bulk of experts sits on this issue. Drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil are mentioned, along with more traditional talk therapy. All are deemed seriously flawed. This is sufficient, but more could have been said about cognitive and exposure treatments, too. The text is clear that the FDA has not yet approved the use of MDMA and that large-scale clinical trials must be conducted before a federal evaluation will take place. But the street version of the substance, called Ecstasy, is, of course, widespread. The story cautions that the street drug often contains harmful contaminants so should not be used in place of MDMA, but one wonders how hard it may be for someone desperate for a way to moderate PTSD symptoms to wait. Small clinical studies of the impact of MDMA on PTSD sufferers have been under way for a number of years, and journalists have been writing about that possible link along the way. The hook for this story is really the recent FDA classification of MDMA as a “breakthrough therapy,” which puts it on a faster track for review (and often a lower bar of evidence is required). This appears to be an intensively reported enterprise story that goes well beyond a MAPS news release.",0
"""Costs are not mentioned. Our research indicates that 5 suppository treatments cost ~$119. A liquid formula that is taken as a few drop 3 times a day cost ~$46 for 100 mL. Costs are particularly important in unconventional therapies as they are largely out of pocket expenses. The story appropriately addresses the issue of benefits. Benefits are anecdotal and reported by parents. No credible, evidence-based benefits have been seen as noted in the story. This story correctly notes that chelation poses significant harms including depletion of essential minerals and death. The story is clear that there is very little evidence, if any, to support the use of chelators to treat autism spectrum disorder. As noted in the story, a review of scientific studies conducted by the Institute of Medicine has failed to show a link between between a vaccine containing a mercury based preservative, thimerosal, and autism spectrum disorder. The story also indicates that a controversial research study designed to test the potential use of chelation in children with autism spectrum disorder was canceled based upon the death of a child undergoing chelation and harmful effects on cognitive function seen with animal testing. This story highlights disease-mongering surrounding the unfounded and potentially dangerous use of chelators to treat or ‘cure’ autism spectrum disorder in children. The story provides information through interviews of several medical experts. All of the experts interviewed noted the lack of evidence and potential harms; however, their opinions are shared by the majority of the scientific community. The only approved drug, resperidone, could have been mentioned in the story. In addition, a variety of behavioral interventions are felt to be """"best practice"""" for managing some of the manifestations of autism. This story correctly indicates that chelators are available in several forms including creams, capsules, suppositories and intravenous infusions of drugs. Chelation is thought to be used by thousands of parents on their children with autism spectrum disorder. The use of chelation to treat autism spectrum disorder is not new. Appropriately, the story does not try to imply that this is new, or that its use in autism is new. This story does not rely on a press release.""",0
"On 12 January 2018, Erin Elizabeth of Health Nut News posted what was, in essence, a regurgitation of a factual article from the Santa Barbara Independent discussing how virulent this year’s flu season is shaping up to be: Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the past two weeks alone. By contrast, only three residents died throughout last year’s entire flu season, which typically runs from October to April. All eight people were ages 65 or older. […] “Our numbers are in line with statewide numbers, and they’re definitely cause for concern,” [public health official Charity Dean said]. Dean attributed this year’s impact to a strain of flu — H3N2 — that’s particularly resistant to vaccination. According to the Center for Disease Control, vaccines have been effective at knocking this strain out only 32 percent of the time. But studies from Australia — where the flu season runs about six months ahead of the United States and Europe — indicates the vaccine’s effectiveness could be even more limited than that, only ten percent. In keeping with her website’s primary modus operandi, Elizabeth uses these tragic deaths to push her own flawed political argument. Her article (bearing the headline “8 Die of ‘Flu’ in 2 Weeks in Santa Barbara. 7 Had Their Flu Shot”) appears to cast doubt on the very existence of influenza, speciously repurposing the story as evidence that people shouldn’t get the flu vaccine: This year’s strain of flu, H3N2, has been knocking people out — hard. But you don’t need a flu shot that’s only 10 percent effective and comes with a host of potential problems. Instead, you need to take care of your body (I’m not a doctor and not trying to tell you what to do) by getting sunlight or taking Vitamin D, drink plenty of water, manage your stress level, and eat plenty of whole foods. Half-hearted disclaimer aside, Elizabeth attempts to make or allude to two medically dubious points while offering her own vitamin D-based treatment plan: The Flu Vaccine Is Ineffective, So Why Bother? The effectiveness of the flu vaccine, as well as the strains it covers, varies year to year depending on — among other things — how well researchers are able to predict which strains will be the most virulent each season. That selection is made each year primarily by the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance Network (WHO GISN) in collaboration with research centers all around the world. How well matched their work is to the strains that become problematic each flu season is a primary driver of the vaccine’s effectiveness. As referenced by Elizabeth, data from Australia had suggested that the 2017-2018 influenza season’s most virulent strain was H3N2. The season’s flu shot did include that strain, however, so a mismatch is not likely the issue; according to an increasing body of research, the issue may be with the strain itself. H3N2 is more difficult to vaccinate against because it can mutate more rapidly during the vaccine production process and as a result, produce antibodies that do not actually impart immunity against the form of H3N2 to which humans are susceptible. In a 4 January 2018 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, scientists have suggested that this year’s prevalence of H3N2 could be related to this fact. Despite the variable effectiveness of annual flu shots — which have never claimed to provide 100 percent certainty of immunity against various strains of the flu — doctors and scientists (even the ones writing about its ineffectiveness against H3N2) still strongly recommend getting the shot. Aaron Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, argued in an 11 January 2018 New York Times piece that even an ineffective vaccine year can provide tangible benefits, save lives, and reduce hospital visits and deaths: Let’s say that this year’s flu vaccine is even worse than we think. Maybe the absolute risk reduction will be as low as 1 percentage point, making the [number of people needed to treat to get a result, a metric known as N.T.T.] 100. That’s still not that bad. Even at an N.N.T. of 100, for every 100 people who get a flu shot, one fewer will get the flu. That’s a pretty low N.N.T. compared with many other treatments that health experts recommend every day. Further, a […] review published in 2016 showed that the N.N.T. in children 6 years old or younger to prevent one flu case was just six — an astonishing payoff in medical terms. It has even been shown to be effective in preventing death in children from flu-related causes.The negatives of a flu shot are almost nonexistent, and significant side effects are very rare. Even in an ineffective year, the benefits greatly outweigh the harms. The Flu Vaccine Will Make You More Susceptible to the Flu and Other Viruses Next Year The flu vaccine has been the subject of a number of either completely or mostly incorrect claims made about its safety, which we have previously reviewed in detail. Here Elizabeth adds to that list with a new claim, made in the form of a link to a YouTube video featuring anti-vaccine activist, Natural News contributor and former nephrologist Suzanne Humphries in which she claims that “plenty” of medical literature demonstrates that a flu shot increases your risk of getting the flu or other respiratory diseases in following years. This is a stretch. One small-scale study published in 2012 found an increased risk of “virologically-confirmed non-influenza infections,” arguing that “being protected against influenza, [flu shot] recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses.” No other studies have replicated this result (though many have tried), and a number of larger-scale studies have, in fact, found no evidence that this is the case. Elizabeth’s effort to turn the tragic deaths of eight senior citizens from the flu into an argument against influenza inoculation rests only on the premise that there is a significant risk to getting the flu shot in the first place. She has provided no credible evidence to support that claim because no credible evidence exists. Instead, she uses the testimony of someone who once provided a biblical rationale for avoiding vaccines to make her argument.",1

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is spending $270 million on these and 45 other research projects to determine the risks of e-cigarettes before millions more Americans become hooked on the devices. “They want data and they want it yesterday,” said Dr Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin of Yale University, who is leading four projects. “Yesterday,” however, is years away. Final results may not be available before 2018, researchers leading the FDA-funded projects told Reuters. That timetable, which has not been reported before, underscores how the slow pace of science is contributing to a regulatory vacuum, allowing e-cigarette makers to sell their products virtually unchallenged. To be sure, studies of e-cigarettes not funded by the FDA are also under way, and the agency can factor those results into any action it takes. But the FDA chose these 48 projects because they address questions central to future regulations. The e-cigarette industry, which Wells Fargo Securities estimates will make $2 billion in global sales this year, says the FDA must wait for the results of the research before it issues any regulations, or manufacturers risk being driven out of business by unproven fears about their products. “There shouldn’t be regulations akin to those for cigarettes without evidence of similar health impact, especially since the preliminary evidence is positive for the industry” when it comes to comparing the contents of e-cigarette vapor to tobacco smoke, said attorney Bryan Haynes. His Richmond, Virginia-based firm Troutman Sanders represents e-cigarette manufacturers. Backed by the world’s biggest tobacco companies, the industry is aggressively expanding its marketing across the country. More than 14 million U.S. adults and nearly 2 million teens and tweens have used e-cigarettes, and the rate of use among high-schoolers doubled from 2011 to 2012, the latest data available. The FDA “will always make regulatory decisions based on the best available science,” said an agency spokeswoman. “With regard to e-cigarettes, the agency does not believe it will take many years to create the regulatory framework” once the FDA has the basic authority to regulate the products, which could happen next year. The missing science includes basic questions such as what compounds are in the vapor produced by e-cigarettes. It also includes complicated ones like whether flavors such as butterscotch and bubble gum entice children to vape, how e-cigarette displays in online stores affect teenagers’ desire to buy vaping liquid, and, perhaps most crucial, whether e-cigarettes will reduce the number of smokers or produce millions of new nicotine addicts. The Yale team, for instance, will study whether menthol and flavors such as chocolate and cherry increase the appeal of e-cigarettes, especially to 16-to-18-year-old smokers or “dual users” who both smoke and vape. If that turns out to be the case, the FDA would have scientific support for regulating. “We’ll have the first results within two years” and complete ones in four to five, Krishnan-Sarin said. REAL-TIME EXPERIMENT      As an uncontrolled experiment in public health, the use of electronic cigarettes is rivaled only by conventional tobacco smoking, a habit adopted by half of American men and one-third of women during its peak in the 1960s. The first Surgeon General’s report on the health dangers of cigarettes was released in 1964, when more than 40 percent of American adults were already hooked. To date, more than 10 million Americans have died from illnesses tied to smoking tobacco. Research on e-cigarettes has moved more quickly, partly because scientists can draw on regular tobacco research to establish the biological effects of vaping. The cartridge-like devices were first introduced in the United States by start-up manufacturers in 2007. Now, the U.S. market is dominated by blu, a brand owned by Lorillard Inc.  Other leading tobacco companies are making a big push for a share of the growing market: R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., a subsidiary of Reynolds American, began selling its Vuse e-cigarette nationwide last month and Altria’s NuMark subsidiary plans to do so with its MarkTen later this year. The FDA got authority to regulate tobacco products, both traditional and novel, with the 2009 Tobacco Control Act. In April, the FDA proposed banning e-cigarette sales to minors, angering public health advocates who want more far-reaching prohibitions on online sales, advertising and flavors. The FDA began funding e-cigarette research in 2012. An FDA-funded project at the University of Louisville in Kentucky illustrates why the pace of science is slow. Scientists there will look at three or four brands of e-cigarettes and analyze their volatile organic compounds, flavorings and particulate matter to see how they affect lung and other cells in lab mice, said lead researcher Dr Sanjay Srivastata. This spring, he began exposing the animals to e-cigarette vapor for up to six months, with full results expected in 2015. While those findings could help FDA quantify risks from vaping, results extending the conclusions to humans are as much as five years away. Another crucial question researchers are trying to answer is whether e-cigarettes will be used mostly by nicotine newbies, including adolescents; by ex-smokers craving a nicotine hit without the carcinogens of tobacco; or by smokers trying to quit. To get a handle on who is likely to use e-cigarettes, scientists at Georgia State University School of Public Health  will conduct online surveys of 6,000 people to assess whether they perceive e-cigarettes as less harmful than the traditional kind, why those who have switched from the latter to e-cigarettes did so, and what influences people’s perceptions of the product’s risk. “This is the kind of research that is going to be informing the FDA’s regulatory process,” said Michael Eriksen, dean of the School of Public Health and leader of three FDA-funded projects on tobacco. The FDA’s proposed e-cigarette rules would give it the power to regulate the ingredients in the vaping liquid, but are silent on the plumes of vapor produced when the liquid is heated. According to research at Virginia Commonwealth University, that may be a dangerous oversight: a form of e-cigarettes called tank systems can get so hot the vapor can contain the carcinogen formaldehyde and other toxic compounds. “We want to know what’s in the emissions, not just the ingredients,” said VCU toxicologist Robert Balster, who is helping to oversee four FDA-funded projects. To find out, VCU engineers are constructing mechanical vaping devices to measure how temperature, voltage, and other parameters affect the content of the plumes from e-cigarettes. They will next comb through Facebook and blog postings to see whether vapers like super-hot temperatures, for instance. Combining the results of the mechanical vaper and real-life habits should show what emissions people are exposed to. “If it turns out that people are tinkering with the electronics to increase the voltage of e-cigarettes, and FDA regulations limit the maximum voltage, that’s useful to know,” since it may justify a requirement that the devices be tinker-proof, said Balster. Full results are years away, he said, “but we’re mindful of getting information to FDA in a timely manner. They’re under a lot of pressure to get moving.”",0
"On 11 November 2010, the Dead Serious News web site published an article positing that a female mortuary worker had become pregnant after engaging in a sex act with a deceased male: A 38 year old female mortuary worker is being held on $250,000 bond after becoming pregnant by one of her clients — a dead man. The alleged crime took place at the Mourning Glory Mortuary just outside of Lexington, Missouri. Police have charged Felicity Marmaduke with desecration of the dead and necrophilia. According to a statement made to police by Marmaduke, the alleged victim experienced a post mortem erection while being bathed. Being alone, Marmaduke straddled the dead man and proceeded have sex with him. Much to her surprise, the alleged victim came to orgasm after several minutes. A few weeks later, Marmaduke had a positive pregnancy test while receiving a routine medical exam. Upon telling her doctor the circumstances leading to the conception, the police were notified. Marmaduke was arrested without incident at her dilapidated trailer home a few blocks from the mortuary. Although the news media occasionally report real cases of workers or interlopers at mortuaries/cemeteries attempting to engage in sex with bodies of the deceased, this item about a female mortuary worker’s becoming pregnant through such an activity is not one of them. It was a spoof from the Dead Serious News site, whose “About” page notes that “Dead Serious News is a satirical website that is updated on an irregular basis. With the exception of the names of public figures, all names are fictional.” In October 2016, the World News Daily Report fake news site recycled this story for a similar article: A 26-year old morgue worker was arrested this morning after a DNA test revealed that her newborn child was the result of a necrophiliac intercourse with a man she was supposed to autopsy. Jennifer Burrows, an assistant pathologist with the Jackson County medical examiner services, is accused of having sex with dozens of corpses over the course of the last two years, a behavior which led the birth of a baby boy on January 7.",1
"It is notable that the company that sells the ONCOblot test (which can be used for early detection of 26 different cancers) doesn’t discuss its price. Some clinics list their test cost at $850 or $1000. It is not known how often testing would need to be repeated, if it is found to be useful for people exposed to asbestos. The release states it’s “an exciting sign of progress in the cancer detection field” because researchers detected “two mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants” in the blood serum of individuals exposed to asbestos “an average of 6.2 years” before they were clinically diagnosed. Unfortunately, that’s the only attempt at quantification found in the release. There’s no mention of accuracy or sensitivity of the test, how many people were tested, or how long the study lasted. It’s not enough to claim that the test is useful. The sponsors should provide some data on how it improves patient outcomes, not just sound an alarm in order to get individuals to take a test. The unfortunate reality is that patients diagnosed with stage 1 disease have a median survival of 21 months and those diagnosed at stage 4 have a median survival of 12 months. It remains to be seen if early detection provides any advantage and a large clinical trial will be needed to see if this is true. While the ONCOblot test itself involves just drawing a blood sample, the results of the test could produce life-threatening harms if it overdiagnoses people. In other words, a person told they have tested positive for these biomarkers for mesothelioma might start treatment too early or unnecessarily. Mesothelioma treatment is notably damaging. Let’s put the study into perspective: there were a total of 32 people enrolled (17 with known malignant mesothelioma and 15 without). Hardly a large enough sample size on which to make the claims made. Although as we noted previously, early detection does offer a small survival advantage, it comes at a cost. The American Cancer Society notes that chemotherapy for mesothelioma can cause hair loss, mouth sores, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, increased risk of infections, easier bruising or bleeding, fatigue and long-lasting nerve damage. Radiation treatment also can cause many of the same problems, as well as lung damage. Combining radiation and chemotherapy often makes side effects worse. It won’t be known whether starting treatment earlier offers any benefits to people at risk for mesothelioma, but it is certain that treating more people earlier would cause more treatment-related harm. The release fails to mention how many people were included in the study: just 17 cancer patients and 15 people who were exposed to asbestos, but had not been diagnosed with cancer. Although the release notes near the top that the study was “retrospective” (it looked back at stored blood samples taken from people exposed to asbestos, some who had been diagnosed with mesothelioma and some without known cancer), there is no mention of the long years of work needed before anyone will be able to say the test would be useful to people who have been exposed to asbestos. The journal article notes, “As with all biomarker studies, these observations require validation in a larger, independent cohort of patients and should include prospective as well as retrospective sampling.” The release should have noted that there is an important difference between finding that people who have cancer carry a certain biomarker and what people really want to know: that the biomarker can predict who will or won’t develop cancer, and even more importantly, whether starting treatment earlier makes any difference. The news release emphasizes that “Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and almost uniformly fatal tumor caused primarily by exposure to asbestos.” However, it fails to note that not only is the disease rare (fewer than 3,000 cases per year in the United States, compared to more than 1.6 million cases and half a million deaths from all types of cancer), but most people exposed to asbestos never get mesothelioma. By implying that this test might be useful for anyone exposed to asbestos, the release sets the stage for a vast sales market of people, most of whom would never have to deal with mesothelioma, regardless of testing. The news release states that the study was done by MorNuCo, the company that developed the ONCOblot test. Another useful flag apparent to close readers is that the only person quoted in the release is not a researcher, but the company’s vice president of business development. The release doesn’t mention any alternatives to the sponsor’s test. Some physicians believe that repeat chest CT scans are useful but this has not been verified in a clinical trial. The other alternative is basic primary care and watchfulness. The news release notes that the ONCOblot test is FDA approved as a “Laboratory Developed Test.” It also includes a link to a company web site with more information on the test and how to get it. The study backs up the characterization in the release that the results represent progress. Aside from the concerns mentioned above about implying the test will benefit patients, it is reasonable to say this test could be useful to researchers planning clinical trials of early treatment of mesothelioma. There are only nine sentences in this release, yet there is room to boast of “exciting results,” “exciting sign of progress” and an “exciting new chapter” that the company is “elated to share.” While the study results may well be exciting to some researchers who are planning clinical trials of early treatments for rare mesothelioma cancers, there is nothing in this study that is truly “exciting” to people worried about their personal risk of developing mesothelioma. The release dangles false hope in front of people exposed to asbestos by pushing the popular myth that “early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths”. As this online primer summarizes, the triple stumbling blocks of lead time bias, length bias and overdiagnosis stand between this study and any real understanding of whether the news may ever be exciting to people worried about the consequences of exposure to asbestos.",1
"The UK newspaper The Telegraph reported on 20 October 2016 that the World Health Organization (WHO) had revised their definition of infertility to include single men and women: Single men and women without medical issues will be classed as “infertile” if they do not have children but want to become a parent, the World Health Organisation is to announce. In a move which dramatically changes the definition of infertility, WHO will declare that it should no longer be regarded as simply a medical condition. The authors of the new global standards said the revised definition gave every individual “the right to reproduce”. Under the new terms, heterosexual single men and women, and gay men and  women who want to have children would be given the same priority as couples seeking IVF because of medical fertility problems. The organization’s decision, the Telegraph stated, was “likely to place pressure” on the National Health Service to change their eligibility standards concerning in-vitro fertilization. However, even though the story was picked up by multiple news outlets, it did not include any material or comments from WHO. Instead, it quoted endocrinologist David Adamson, a leading reproductive health practitioner whose Huffington Post  contributor profile references him as a fertility expert for the WHO. According to the Telegraph, Adamson, listed as an author of the new WHO standards, said: The definition of infertility is now written in such a way that it includes the rights of all individuals to have a family, and that includes single men, single women, gay men, gay women. It puts a stake in the ground and says an individual’s got a right to reproduce whether or not they have a partner. It’s a big change. It fundamentally alters who should be included in this group and who should have access to healthcare. It sets an international legal standard. Countries are bound by it. We contacted Adamson to confirm the Telegraph‘s reporting, but did not respond. Meanwhile, WHO’s  website has not reflected any changes to their terminology concerning infertility, which does not mention single people at all: The organization denied the Telegraph‘s reporting in a statement sent to us on 29 October 2016:  In 2009, WHO joined with the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ICMART) and other partners to develop a Glossary of definitions for infertility and fertility care. This Glossary included the clinical definition for infertility as “a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.” This is keeping with WHO definition of male and female infertility in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10) WHO has not changed its use of this definition. It is important to note that this definition provides a clinical description of infertility. It does not make any recommendations about the provision of fertility care services. WHO is currently collaborating with its partners to update the Glossary and consideration is being given to revising the definition of infertility. Should there be a change in the definition of infertility, it will remain a clinical description of infertility as a disease of the reproductive system and will not make recommendations about the provision of fertility care services. WHO definitions are contained in ICD and that glossary is not an official WHO publication but rather a work that WHO staff contribute to. The organization also reiterated their definition of infertility via Twitter: @pved Our definition of #infertility remains the same https://t.co/fbkyxzWocd — WHO (@WHO) October 22, 2016",1
"""As the government inched toward a shutdown on April 8, 2011, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., gave a speech on the Senate floor to respond to Democratic charges that the major sticking point in the negotiations was a disagreement over Planned Parenthood. Many Republicans want to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the organization does abortions. The federal government currently provides Planned Parenthood with $363 million annually, but by law, that money cannot be spent on abortion. It is spent on other types of health care services, such as cancer screenings, breast exams, and tests and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Some opponents of abortion say that by sending any money to Planned Parenthood, taxpayers are still supporting abortions indirectly, since money is fungible. That’s why they’re pushing to eliminate all funding for the organization. Here’s a portion of what Kyl said on the floor:  """"Everybody goes to clinics, to hospitals, to doctors, and so on. Some people go to Planned Parenthood. But you don’t have to go to Planned Parenthood to get your cholesterol or your blood pressure checked. If you want an abortion, you go to Planned Parenthood, and that’s well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does."""" We got many requests to fact-check his statement. Planned Parenthood says the statistics are dramatically different -- that 90 percent of its services are preventive in nature, compared with 3 percent that are abortion-related. Planned Parenthood calculates the numbers by services provided, rather than dollars spent. In a fact sheet last updated in March 2011, the group lists the following breakdown of its services:  Contraception (including reversible contraception, emergency contraception, vasectomies and tubal sterilizations): 4,009,549 services  Sexually transmitted infections testing and treatment: 3,955,916 services  Cancer screening and prevention: 1,830,811 services  Other women’s health services (including pregnancy tests and prenatal care): 1,178,369 services  Abortions: 332,278 procedures  Miscellaneous (including primary care and adoption referrals): 76,977  Total services: 11,383,900  By this tally, abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, which is the most recent year for which the group is reporting statistics. And that would make Kyl’s statement way off. We should note a few caveats. First, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of """"services"""" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. Second, it’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith. Still, even with those caveats, we do think that Kyl has vastly overstated the share of abortions. We checked with Kyl’s office but did not hear back. However, a few hours after the speech, CNN anchor T.J. Holmes told viewers that the network had received a statement from Kyl’s office saying that the senator’s remark """"was not intended to be a factual statement but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives millions in taxpayer dollars, does subsidize abortions."""" The statistics from Planned Parenthood and the statement from Kyl's office make it clear that he erred by saying abortion counts for well over 90 percent of the group's services. We find his claim .""",1
"The story clearly states near the top that this treatment is “very expensive.” It reports that crizotinib treatment costs about $9,600 per month and that patients may continue to be treated until the cancer resumes spreading. There is also a reference to an assistance plan offered by Pfizer. The story also reports that tumors “shrank or stopped growing in just over half of patients for nearly two years on average.” From this information, careful readers could calculate that the drug cost (not including associated medical care and tests) would routinely approach a quarter of a million dollars per patient. It would have been helpful if the story had provided this calculation. The story also reports that the test needed to identify appropriate patients costs $250. Readers of this story are likely to get an exaggerated sense of the benefits of this drug. As noted above, the preliminary trials completed so far did not produce evidence of improved outcomes or survival, nor did those trials include any comparison of the new treatment with existing alternatives. The story reports that “tumors disappeared, shrank or stopped growing in just over half of patients for nearly two years on average.” The drug label indicates that tumors “disappeared” in only three patients out of 255. The story reports on two patients who gave glowing reports of their responses, but there were no quotes from more typical patients who had limited, if any, responses or who endured serious side effects. The story then includes a reference to the short survival of typical lung cancer patients, without included the necessary caveat about the unreliability of such historical comparisons. The one-sided reporting provides an unbalanced view of the drug’s potential benefits. The story should have been clearer that the main reason this drug received conditional approval is that there is a reasonable likelihood of benefit; and that we won’t know if that benefit is real until the ongoing trials are completed. The story quotes sources claiming “You’re going to be sparing individuals side effects” and it describes Xalkori as “a pill with relatively minor side effects compared to the hair loss and nausea that chemotherapy can cause”. The drug label and FDA news release are less dismissive of the problems experienced by patients in the preliminary trials so far. While few trial participants reported symptoms severe enough to cause serious harm, hospitalization or symptoms so bad they couldn’t carry on routine activities, most of the patients did report problems with vision and more than half reported nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or other gastrointestinal symptoms, including some that may have required treatment. Treatment was interrupted in 36 percent of the patients in one of the trials and 45 percent of the patients in the other trial. Five percent of patients had neutropenia, abnormally low white blood cell counts. (See http://labeling.pfizer.com/showlabeling.aspx?id=676) The FDA news release included a list of side effects and warned of potentially life-threatening reactions. “The most common side effects reported in patients receiving Xalkori included vision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, swelling (edema), and constipation. Vision disorders included visual impairment, flashes of light, blurred vision, floaters, double vision, sensitivity to light, and visual field defects. Xalkori use has also been associated with inflammation of the lung tissue (pneumonitis), which can be life-threatening. Patients with treatment-related pneumonitis should permanently stop treatment with Xalkori. The drug should not be used in pregnant women.” (See http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm269856.htm) The story should have summarized these side effects and warnings. It should have also noted that since the trials reported by Pfizer included only 255 patients, little is known about the potential risk of rare, but serious, side effects. If only this story had been as straightforward as the drug label that starkly declares, “There are no data available demonstrating improvement in patient reported outcomes or survival with XALKORI.” (See http://labeling.pfizer.com/showlabeling.aspx?id=676) Instead, the story offers a murky statement that, “Research to determine overall survival is ongoing.” Deep in the story, readers are told that this drug approval is unusual because standard trials to compare the new treatment to conventional care have not been completed. However, the story does not report that only 255 patients were included in the trials. Readers are left to figure out on their own that there was no blinding or randomization done in the completed trials. The FDA news release offers information about the tentative nature of the evidence and an explanation that the drug was approved before convincing evidence of benefit was available only because these patients don’t have good treatment alternatives. (See http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm269856.htm) The story should have included this important context. The top of the story notes that this drug is intended for use in a small subset of lung cancer patients. Deeper in the story, readers are told that roughly 4 percent of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer have tumors with the gene variant that may respond to this drug, and it quotes a Pfizer company source as saying that about 6,000 Americans a year develop cancer fitting this definition. It would have been helpful for this story to include some estimate of the number of lung cancer patients who may be candidates for testing to see if their tumors have the relevant gene. While the story notes the conflicts of some sources, it appears that all the experts quoted were participants in a conference call arranged by Pfizer. The story appears to imply that standard treatments don’t work for patients with tumors that have this specific gene variant. However, cancer treatment statistics indicate that these patients are just as likely as other patients to respond to first-line treatment. The new drug is intended to be used when those standard treatments aren’t enough. Then the tumor gene test is needed, because giving this new drug does not appear to do any good for the overwhelming majority of patients, it is to be used only in that subset of patients with tumors that might be susceptible. Also, the story should have been clearer about explaining that neither of the preliminary trials included any comparison to standard treatment. The story is clear that crizotinib recently received FDA approval for use “along with a companion diagnostic test for just a small subset of lung cancer patients.” However, while the story refers to ongoing research, the actual status of the drug is not explained. The FDA approval letter warns that, “If postmarketing trials fail to verify that clinical benefit is conferred by XALKORI (crizotinib) Capsules, 200 mg and 250 mg, or are not conducted with due diligence, we may, following a hearing in accordance with 21 CFR 314.530(b), withdraw or modify approval.” Readers should have been clearly told that this drug is still very much on trial. Based on this story, readers may believe that this drug is the first of its kind. However, the FDA news release says the gene test is the truly novel part of the combination approved and the release goes on to point out, “It is the second such targeted therapy approved by the FDA this year.” Nevertheless, the approach taken with this sort of gene test and specfic drug combination is new and very different from typical chemotherapy, which is the angle highlighted in the story. This story appears to rely entirely on a conference call arranged and managed by Pfizer, in essence an audio news release.",1
"""Congress is deciding whether to reform the nation’s farm subsidy system and, while it is at it, will probably cut the amount it dedicates to food stamps for the poor and low-income workers. Both programs are part of what’s known as the farm bill, the five-year authorization that sets the terms for government crop assistance and defines eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It turns out that some Congress members receive farm subsidies themselves, or get them through farms and corporations they and their relatives own. Whether they should or shouldn’t is not for us to say. Proponents and opponents of the subsidies, primarily direct payments made to farm owners, can be found in both political parties. But U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, finds it disconcerting that some of the lawmakers who gladly take the government’s subsidies want to cut SNAP, or subsidies to people who need help buying groceries. Discussing the 2013 farm bill, which recently passed in the Senate and is under debate in the House, Brown told reporters on a conference call on June 12, """"There's a lot of pressure in the House of Representatives to just emasculate the SNAP program. For whatever reason, some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies. They think they earned that, and on the other hand, then they want to cut food stamps, and I think that's morally wrong."""" We cannot read the minds of subsidy recipients, so we will not judge whether Congress members -- who earn $174,000 federal salaries -- think they have earned the right to farm  subsidies. But Brown’s claim struck us as worth examining. Examples were easy to find. The Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an advocacy and research group, maintains a database of federal farm subsidies and has run lawmakers’ names to see what they or their families are getting. News organizations have used this database (and the public can, too), and some have noted where the recipients stand on food stamps, or SNAP. For instance: * Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, """"who supports billions of dollars in cuts to the food stamp program,"""" is """"one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies, according to new annual data released by a Washington environmental group."""" This was in the New York Times on May 22. Fincher, from Frog Jump, Tenn., and his wife """"collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012,"""" reported the Times, using EWG data. In 2012 alone, the couple received about $70,000 in direct payments, which is """"money that is given to farmers and farmland owners, even if they do not grow crops,"""" the Times wrote. During debate in May on whether to cut $20.5 billion from SNAP over the next 10 years, Fincher, a Republican, said, """"We have to remember there is not a big printing press in Washington that continually prints money over and over. This is other people’s money that Washington is appropriating and spending."""" * Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California and his wife, Jill, together own one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which in 2012 alone got $188,570 in direct farm payments from the federal government, according to the EWG. That would put last year’s subsidies to LaMalfa and his wife at $62,857. But going back to 1995, the DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership has received  $5.13 million, which would put the share of Rep. LaMalfa and his wife at $1.7 million, EWG said. In May, LaMalfa won a House amendment that would require electronic fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He said in a statement then, """"The success of the food stamp program should be measured by how many Americans become self-sufficient, not how many are added to the rolls."""" * Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997, according to the EWG. Stutzman, a Republican, recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, deeper than the $20.5 billion now on the table, saying, """"Everyone in Washington talks about deficit reduction but we’ve introduced a real, responsible plan to save taxpayer dollars. Over the past decade, SNAP spending has doubled as this program outgrows its original mission of providing temporary assistance."""" The list goes on. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, both reviewing the same EWG data as other media, noted that 15 members of Congress got farm subsidies in 2012. (None were from Ohio.) Thirteen were Republicans and two were Democrats. The Democrats were in the Senate -- Michael Bennett of Colorado and Jon Tester of Montana, who says he is the Senate’s only """"working farmer."""" Both voted June 10 for the Senate version of the farm bill, which would cut SNAP by $4 billion, or about $16 billion less than the House GOP leaders want. Brown, too, voted for the bill after failing to get the SNAP cut restored. It’s fairly obvious where this leaves Brown’s claim that some House members accepted """"hundreds of thousands of dollars"""" in farm subsidies but are eager to cut food stamps. But before ruling, we’ll note in fairness that some of the farm-subsidy recipients told the Wall Street Journal that the farm programs need reform, too. Fincher issued a statement saying, """"I voted immediately to remove direct payments,"""" the Journal wrote. And, the Journal added, a spokesman for LaMalfa said the lawmaker has long opposed the farm-subsidy system and voted to end direct payments. In Stutzman’s case, the receipt of subsidies was a political issue in his 2010 election. But he maintained to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that the farm-support system is like a mandate, giving him no choice. The farmer """"has to take it,"""" he told the Journal Gazette in 2010. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the program is voluntary. OK, so maybe he and the others didn’t like it one bit when they got farm subsidies. We’re not here to judge their motives. But we are here to judge Brown’s claim. It is .""",0
"Warnings that tilapia is unsafe to eat have been circulating for years. There are warnings that tilapia is a “mutant” fish that doesn’t have skin or bones. There are warnings that tilapia don’t exist in the wild. There are warnings that eating tilapia is worse than eating bacon or hamburger. And there are warnings that tilapia causes cancer. None of them are true. There are various sources of these rumors. But they were all consolidated into a meme that first went viral in 2017 and resurfaced in April 2018. Without citing sources, the meme repeated old (and untrue) rumors that tilapia is unsafe to eat. Tilapia Are Mutants, Can’t Be Found in the Wild Tilapia are native to Africa and date at least back to the Egyptian period. In fact, tilapia are even featured in ancient Egyptian art, often portraying a symbol of rebirth. So, again, the idea that tilapia are mutants and can’t be found in the wild are baseless. These claims are probably based on the widespread introduction of tilapia into aquaculture in the 1980s. After that point, tilapia was widely farmed in cages and open bodies of water. That helped tilapia go from “unknown in the U.S. in the mid-1990s to the fifth most popular seafood we eat,” the Atlantic reports. The rise of tilapia coincided with the fall of Northeast cod fishery in the 1990s. So, while the tilapia sold in restaurants and grocery stores is most likely the result of aquaculture — claims that tilapia is a “mutant” fish don’t check out. Eating Tilapia Worse that Eating Bacon or Hamburger Claims that eating tilapia is worse that eating bacon or hamburger have persisted for years — but experts counter that there’s no truth to them. They can be traced back to a 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. The study warns that tilapia isn’t a good food for controlling inflammatory diseases like heart disease. It’s authors continued: “All other nutritional content aside, the inflammatory potential of hamburger and pork bacon is lower than the average serving of farmed tilapia.” Many websites seized on the claims. The popular diet franchise “Eat This, Not That!” warned that tilapia has a fraction of the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids as salmon and other fish, and has “sky high” levels of unhealthy omega-6 fats. It’s conclusion? Tilapia is worse than bacon or hamburger. Scientists quickly pushed back. Dr. William Harris, a senior scientist and director of the metabolism and nutrition at the nonprofit Sanford Research Center, noted that “most health experts (including organizations such as the American Heart Association and the American Dietetic Association) agree that omega-5 fatty acids are, in fact, heart healthy: Tilapia and catfish are examples of lower-fat fish that have fewer omega-3s than the oily fish listed above, but still provide more of these heart-healthy nutrients than hamburger, steak, chicken, pork or turkey. Actually, a 3 ounce serving of these fish provides over 100 mg of the long chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Considering that this is about the current daily intake of these fatty acids in the US, even these fish should be considered better choices than most other meat alternatives. Since they are also relatively low in total and saturated fats and high in protein, they clearly can be part of a healthy diet. Researchers at Harvard sounded a similar tune, debunking the idea that tilapia is worse than bacon or hamburger. Tilapia Contains Cancer-Causing Dioxin Dioxins are some of the most toxic substances on earth, and they have been linked to cancer. And it’s true that “more than 90 percent of human exposure” to dioxins comes from food. It’s stored in fat tissue and can accumulate throughout the food chain, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports. But tilapia don’t appear to be at a higher risk for containing dioxins than any other fish. In fact, because tilapia are often farmed and not caught in the wild, their dioxin levels could actually be lower than levels in other species of fish. So, again, claims that tilapia contain cancer-causing dioxin are mostly fiction. It’s possible, but there’s no elevated risk. Comments",1
"A series of images showing a manual purportedly written by “Antifa,” or anti-fascist protestors, was published on various internet forums and websites in August 2017. The first page of the alleged “antifa manual” can be seen below, while the remaining 7 pages have been archived here:  “The Antifa Manual” gained traction on social media around the same time a purported flyer from the anti-fascist group which called for the murder of white children was being circulated. As both of these fraudulent documents shared many of the same telling characteristics, here is a rundown of ways to tell that the manual is fake: Although we’ve only come across one set of images purportedly showing this “antifa manual,” we’ve seen several different claims about where and how this document was found. Although most asserted that this document was found at Evergreen State College, others claimed that it was found at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Others declared that the manual had been “leaked.” The earliest posting of this document that we could uncover was shared on the web site Imgur on 12 August 2017 by a user named “Jebediah88.” As the Anti-Defamation League explains on their web site, “88 is a white supremacist numerical code for “Heil Hitler.” As with the fake antifa flyer, these images purport to show a document that was created by a central or national antifa group and distributed to members in order to inform them about various policies, philosophies, or organizational rules. But there is no overarching antifa organization or leadership. Instead, there are a variety of antifa groups who are loosely organized, as historian Mark Bray wrote in the Washington Post: There are antifa groups around the world, but antifa is not itself an interconnected organization, any more than an ideology like socialism or a tactic like the picket line is a specific group. Antifa are autonomous anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. They expose them to their neighbors and employers, they conduct public education campaigns, they support migrants and refugees and they pressure venues to cancel white power events. The vast majority of anti-fascist organizing is nonviolent. But their willingness to physically defend themselves and others from white supremacist violence and preemptively shut down fascist organizing efforts before they turn deadly distinguishes them from liberal anti-racists. The actual text of “The Antifa Manual” contains several passages that contradict what we know about antifa groups. The cover page, for instance, states that this document should not be given to “cis white males, non-PoC, non-LGBTQ peoples.” Yet, cis white males (white men whose gender identity matches the gender they were assigned at birth), non-PoC (White people) and non-lgbtq (those who do not identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer) individuals are welcome members of antifa groups. Other passages read more like satire. For example, one paragraph describes “ANTIFA regulators” who will monitor the use of racial epithets. Other passages spout conspiracy theories, such as microchipping all individuals or building a “New World Order.” None of these ideas align with any messages that are actually espoused by antifa groups. Other portions mocked the group’s members (“Those who can’t work will be provided a stipend and unlimited supply of opiates, marijuana, meth and cocaine to occupy their free time”), insultingly described groups of people that antifa supposedly champion (“container ship after container ship will be converted to massive passenger cruise-liners and will ferry poverty-stricken brown people from around the world to the (former) United States and Western Europe”), or were racially insensitive or demeaning. Here are some of the more unbelievable passages:      The NYC Antifa group told us in an email that this “antifa manual” was fake. They also directed us to some general literature published by antifa-supporting outlets, such as the anarchist news web site It’s Going Down, for comparison. It’s Going Down published it’s own manual called “Forming An Antifa Group: A Manual,” which is starkly different from the fake antifa manual addressed above. For instance, the fake antifa manual labeled cisgender White men as the “greatest evil mankind has ever known.” The “Forming an Antifa Group” manual, on the other hand, focuses on tracking and opposing white supremacist groups. The fake antifa manual also outlines various political standpoints of the group. However, the genuine article noted that while antifa groups are aligned in their opposition to fascism, they do not necessarily agree on other political issues:",1
"Two doses of belantamab mafodotin helped subdue the disease in adults who had received three prior treatments for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells, GSK said on Friday. The company intends to seek market approval and submit data from the trial to regulatory bodies this year. GSK sold its approved oncology drugs to Novartis in 2014, but has staged a comeback in cancer treatment with a deal to buy U.S. firm Tesaro for $5.1 billion last year and an agreement in February to pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.09 billion) to Germany’s Merck KGaA for the rights to a next-generation immunotherapy. “We are on track to file belantamab mafodotin later this year and continue to investigate how it could help even more patients with this disease,” GSK’s Chief Scientific Officer Hal Barron said. The drug targets a protein linked to multiple myeloma known as BCMA. “This is yet another positive signal that GSK’s R&D engine is being turned around and should be well received by the market,” said Liberum analyst Graham Doyle. In another recent win in oncology, GSK’s Zejula - formerly Tesaro’s lead compound - was shown to slow progression of ovarian cancer. GSK shares were up 1% at 0923 GMT versus a 0.4% gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index. Details of the belantamab mafodotin trial, which tracked how patients fared over time and did not feature a comparison group without the novel treatment, would be presented at an as yet undisclosed medical conference, the company added. The interim result gives further credence to a class of molecules known as antibody drug conjugates (ADC) that belantamab mafodotin belongs to. The concept further builds on the established method of using antibodies that block or bind to foreign substances in the body. ADC, in turn, are antibodies with a cell toxin as a molecular add-on. That allows chemotherapeutic agents, which are harmful to all human cells, to be brought to cancer cells at much higher doses than in conventional chemotherapy. AstraZeneca agreed in March agreed to pay up to $6.9 billion to work with Daiichi Sankyo on an ADC against breast cancer, in a challenge to another ADC called Kadcyla, made by Roche. Multiple myeloma is the second most common form of blood cancer. While it can be treated, there is no available cure, GSK said. The condition is expected to claim the lives of 13,000 people in the U.S. in 2019, according to the American Cancer Society. The BCMA protein that is characteristic of multiple myeloma is also being used as a target in cell therapies developed by Johnson & Johnson, bluebird bio Inc, Celgene Corp.",0
"""Radio host and Fox News personality Glenn Beck loves to tell a story with dramatic flair. And he’s latched onto one this holiday season that’s familiar to many Ohioans. It’s the story of Wilmington, a town of 13,000 people in Southwest Ohio that has lost about 8,600 jobs since DHL Express, it largest employer, pulled out in 2008. The job losses the small town has suffered since DHL’s departure have been the subject of presidential campaign stops, celebrity charity events and numerous media reports, including two from CBS’s vaunted 60 Minutes. In Beck’s version of the story, Wilmington is real life Bedford Falls, the fictitious town in the holiday classic, It’s a Wonderful Life. Wilmington, Beck said on his Nov. 22 radio show, is ground zero of the recession, and its people – like those in Bedford Falls -- are pulling together to save the town through self reliance and prayer. What makes the Wilmington really special, he continued, is that Wilmington refuses government assistance, a key tenet of the political philosophy he espouses on his shows. """"It went from the No. 1 most up-and-coming city, and a city everybody wants to live in, to ground zero. And this town hasn’t taken any money from the government. They don’t want any money from the government,"""" he said on the show. Beck then noted how Wilmington area churches are working together to provide food for the citizens and asking God -- not the state or federal government -- to fill its food pantries. To highlight his Wilmington story, Beck will hold a show titled """"America’s First Christmas"""" at city’s Murphy Theatre on December 15. The proceeds will be donated to a charity in the city. """"I’m going there because I think this town needs to be highlighted,"""" he said. """"I think this town is going to help the rest of the country, not the other way around."""" With such a large spotlight headed shining on the small town, Politifact Ohio decided to review Beck’s storyline that Wilmington shuns government assistance. We asked for Beck’s sources, but our e-mails to his producer went unanswered. So, we looked ourselves. We quickly found Beck’s story full of holes. Immediately after DHL announced the closing of its Wilmington air hub, elected officials at the city, state and federal levels began seeking help for DHL workers. The federal government awarded a $3.87 million national emergency grant to Ohio in November 2008 specifically to provide job training and other aid to DHL workers in Wilmington and the surrounding area. It was administered through the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. The area has since received a second national emergency grant worth $4.1 million. Wilmington and Clinton County benefited handsomely from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the stimulus bill, that was passed in February 2009. The tracking website for the stimulus program allows anybody, including Beck, to search by ZIP code to find the total money spent within the postal district. Using Wilmington’s zip code – 45177, which includes the surrounding county – the site shows that the area received $7,009,811 in stimulus money through September. The figure includes money that went to the Wilmington city schools, Clinton County Department of Jobs and Family Services and the Clinton County Community Action Group, a non-profit organization that aids the poor in in the region and provides free weatherization to residents. The city of Wilmington received a $79,231 stimulus grant to provide programs designed to prevent and control crime; a $167,392 grant for investment in rural public transit vehicles, and about $4 million to replace roads, curbs and sidewalks, typically replaced by residents. In addition, the Ohio Department of Development is extensively involved in the community. It has provided money to Clinton County Port Authority to help redevelop the Wilmington air park. It’s also offering Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, a new company operating at the air park, more than $5.2 million in state assistance to grow its business there. Wilmington Mayor David Raizk, who cited several other sources of federal assistance flowing to the city, said he’s chasing any government help he can get. """"I’ve beat on more doors than I can count,"""" he says. """"Not because we are looking for hand out - but we are looking for a hand up. My job is to get whatever assistance I can get for the citizens here and to help create jobs for them."""" So where does all this leave Beck’s premise that Wilmington is a place that shuns government help? Beck took enough literary license in his holiday tale to make Frank Capra blush. His statement isn’t just false. It’s also ridiculous enough to earn a Politifact rating of .""",1
"This is Part II of a three-part series on crime in Sweden. Read Part I:”Is Sweden the ‘Rape Capital’ of Europe?“ Recently, conspiracy and tabloid web sites have been filled with horror stories about refugees in Sweden, accusing them of everything from rape and murder to sheer bad manners. Writing for the British tabloid The Daily Mail on 3 March 2017, Katie Hopkins described the situation in breathless terms: The fears are real. The areas migrants inhabit have become sink suburbs, riddled with no-go zones, even for the police, where hand-grenade attacks are the accepted norm, women stay indoors, and the ambulances and fire engines need police escorts. God help any good people forced to live here … World leaders such as British politicians Nigel Farage and U.S. president Donald Trump have claimed that Sweden is now overrun with crime because the country took in about 193,000 asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016. However, most violence in Sweden can’t be linked to asylum seekers. Instead, economic stagnation in immigrant communities that formed decades ago has resulted in intergenerational poverty, which has in turn fueled the proliferation of street gangs. Data provided by Statistics Sweden show, for example, that unemployment is higher and education levels lower in Herrgården, which is thought of as the most dangerous part of Rosengård, a neighborhood in Malmö. The city of Malmö is often the subject of news reports about the supposed Swedish crime wave. Deputy Mayor Nils Karlsson told us that crime in these areas stems from Sweden’s failure to integrate previous generations of immigrants. Since the vast majority of the ethnically-Swedish population is college-educated, employers usually choose people with academic degrees over those without degrees, even for entry-level positions — in short, the same disparities that fuel crime all over the world: People with a background outside Europe have a much larger unemployment rate than people like me. In some areas of Malmö, the unemployment rate is 40 percent, while in other parts it’s about 1 percent. That is not a well-integrated society. If you’re growing up and your parents don’t have a job and don’t have much money, of course you’re not going to see that many alternatives for yourself. The key to stopping crime is getting people to work. The problem here is the level of education for the people coming here doesn’t match the job market anymore. Sweden’s governmental agency that conducts crime research, Brå, has not performed a study that takes into account the nationality of crime suspects since 2005, as the law currently prevents them from tracking the national origin of crime suspects and victims. In 2005, they found that people with non-Swedish backgrounds were 2.5 times more likely to be crime suspects, but Brå pointed to a Stockholm University finding that economic opportunity and social mobility play a decisive role in criminal activity: In the empirical analyses we follow all individuals who completed compulsory schooling during the period 1990 to 1993 in the Stockholm Metropolitan area (N=66,330), and we analyze how background factors related to the family of origin and neighborhood segregation during adolescence influence the gap in recorded crimes, which are measured in 2005. For males, we are generally able to explain between half and three-quarters of this gap in crime by parental socioeconomic resources and neighborhood segregation. For females, we can explain even more, sometimes the entire gap. Resources in the family of origin appear to be the strongest mediator. In addition, the residual differences are virtually unrelated to immigrants’ country of origin, indicating that ‘culture’ or other shared context-of-exit factors matter very little in generating the gap. (The term “context-of-exit” means the circumstances under which migrants left their home country). The experts we interviewed all noted that critics are conflating recently-arrived asylum seekers with other populations when they talk about “migrant crime.” Many of the persons committing crimes in areas such as Malmö or the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby are young people who were either born in Sweden to immigrant parents or were born outside the country but arrived in Sweden at a young age. Joakim Palmkvist, a long-time crime reporter for the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan, which is based in Malmö, explained that there is no massive new crime wave being perpetrated by newly-arrived refugees in Sweden’s suburbs — instead, crime today is an iteration of gang violence that has been going on in the country since the 1990s, starting with American exports such as the motorcycle gangs Hell’s Angels and Bandidos. Sitting in a small meeting area in Sydsvenskan‘s newsroom, Palmkvist explained that the motorcycle gangs were the “first wave” of gang organization in Sweden. They set the stage for the “second wave,” which to a large extent consisted of the children of people who fled the Balkan war. The current spate in violence in these areas is the result of a power vacuum in the organized crime community and the younger “third wave” — children of immigrants who have lived in Sweden most of their lives — who are now trying to establish themselves. What sets the so-called third wave apart from earlier waves is its chaotic nature, loose structure, and disconnection from wider society. The bar of what can spark a homicide is also lower than it has ever been; a wrong look or a leer at a girlfriend could lead to a shooting, Palmkvist said: The second wave, a couple have been killed off, trickled away, retired, some have gone to prison as well … The third wave is coming into that vacuum and they are fighting amongst each other to see who will be the main man. Crime researcher Johanna Olseryd pointed out that Brå’s annual crime survey showed that homicides aren’t increasing, but they are changing in nature: Less people are being victimized in the general population, but then we have a small group of people who are victimized repeatedly… Also when it comes to lethal violence, we haven’t seen an increase there but we have seen an increase in the proportion of cases that are perpetrated with guns. There’s been a change in the type of homicides that occur in Sweden — more guns and more homicides connected to a criminal milieu. We haven’t had an increase in total, but we can see the share of cases that have occurred with guns in these areas have increased. Police in Malmö are currently handling 14 homicides, a number that has overwhelmed local investigators, said Erik Jansåker, police chief for Malmö’s southern areas. One of the most rattling of the recent deaths was that of 16-year-old immigrant Ahmed Obaid, himself an immigrant. No one knows for certain why he was targeted in Rosengård while standing by a bus stop. A bouquet of yellow flowers still rested against a light pole at the bus stop on 16 March 2017, two months after his shooting. Officer Johannes Schultz, who patrols the neighborhood on foot, told us that Obaid’s shooting death sent a chill through the community: That changed the whole society in Rosengård. Even 17, 18 year-olds say they are afraid to go out when it’s dark now. Because he got shot and no one knows why. He was not a criminal. There have been less people out in the evenings than it was before that. But people tend to forget and it’s getting warmer, so it’s easier to be outside. Karlsson said that while the country’s crime is historically low he can understand the fear that the violence can engender, as when it does happen, it tends to be high profile: Despite us having taken in many immigrants during the 1990s when we had the Balkan crisis up to now, even with that immigration, the level of crimes have decreased. But Sweden is a small country and Malmö is a small city, and if someone gets shot many people will know that person. I can understand why people are scared. Yet, Karlsson, said, crime in Sweden has been alternately sensationalized and ignored. He told us that both liberals (who think of Sweden as a paradise) and conservatives (who say it is overrun with violence) have both gotten it wrong: Saying everything is great is not helping because you have to say there is a problem before you actually fix it. Sweden has been quite good at spreading the reputation about how perfect we are, which of course now backfires. But we used to have and still do have a low crime rate … since the early 1900s. Research from Brå backs him up — crime data show a general downward trend since 2005:  In this graph from Sweden’s crime study, the dark solid line represents citizens who said they were victims of crime. The dotted line represents people who said someone in their household had been the victim of property crime, while the light solid line represents people who said they were victims of crimes on their person, a broad legal term that can mean anything from homicide to trespassing. Brå explained that overall, crime figures are trending down: The proportion of people who say they have been victim of any crime during the year have declined over the past decade, from 26 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2015. Primarily, the proportion of households who are victims of property crimes decreased, from 13 percent in 2006 to 10 percent 2015.",1
"The news release provides no information about how much the vaccine is likely to cost. Cost is especially important in the developing world where it is most likely to be used and in large quantities. The news release explains that, among participants vaccinated immediately, no Ebola cases were identified 10 days or more after vaccination, compared to 23 cases among individuals assigned to the delayed vaccination group. The data also suggested that the vaccine reduced Ebola risks for unvaccinated individuals within the contact rings of those who were vaccinated, but the news release notes that the study was not designed to test this so-called “herd immunity” effect, so it will require further research to confirm that vaccinating some individuals reduces the likelihood of their contacts developing Ebola. The release could have explained more clearly that the virus has a 10 day incubation period during which the virus can develop in the patient and not be affected by the vaccine as the body won’t have time to develop immunity. But the fact that the two groups (vaccinated and delayed vaccination) had equal numbers during the 0 to 10 day period helps to confirm that the two groups were equal in their exposure to the virus and risk of developing Ebola. The news release also accurately quantifies the harms associated with this vaccine, noting that more than half of those vaccinated reported mild side effects, including short-term headaches, fatigue and muscle pain. The release also identified two serious negative reactions (a high fever and an allergic reaction) associated with the vaccination and a flu-like illness that might have been a result of the vaccine. This is a particularly strong point of the release in that many releases on drug/vaccine studies don’t quantify the adverse event rates very clearly or completely. The news release notes that the trials involved 5,837 people who received the vaccine and 6,004 who did not. The fact that no patients in the vaccination group developed Ebola suggests that the vaccine does indeed have some effect. The statistical significance in the two groups for all patients was p = 0.01, suggesting that the result was unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. On the other hand, the fact that the study was stopped early does raise the possibility that a longer lasting study would have found a smaller difference between the two groups as this is typically found in studies stopped early for effect. Ebola is certainly a serious disease, given the high fatality rates when outbreaks occur. The news release acknowledges this but does not use sensational language or otherwise overplay the risks Ebola poses. The news release identifies the funding sources for the study, which included WHO and a number of government agencies from Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, along with the international organizations the Wellcome Trust and Médecins Sans Frontières. The news release also identifies the organizations with which the study’s research team members were associated, although it does not give any indication of the extent to which research team members or their organizations receive additional funding from Merck, which obviously stands to gain the most if the vaccine proves effective and is recommended for use by the World Health Organization. The news release also briefly summarizes a study of a different Ebola vaccine candidate being developed by a Chinese organization. This study, also published in the same issue of The Lancet, was much smaller, involving only 500 participants, and suggested that the effectiveness of this vaccine declined during the first six months after the initial injection. To be even more thorough, the release might have acknowledged that still other vaccines are under development by GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson and at least one other pharmaceutical company. The news release provides fairly detailed information about the next steps in the vaccine approval process, noting that Merck has committed to submitting the vaccine for regulatory approval by the end of 2017 and that the company has committed to making 300,000 doses available should an outbreak occur before approval is gained. It also notes that if an outbreak occurred before the vaccine is approved, it could be used, with informed consent of those vaccinated, through a “compassionate use” program. The news release notes that no other Ebola vaccine is currently available, briefly summarizes results of a trial of an alternative vaccine and notes that the study findings being described “add weight to early trial results” published previously on the same vaccine. The Lancet news release eschews sensational language in reference to either Ebola or the vaccine. However, the statement that there was a dramatic effect (0 deaths vs 23 deaths) suggests that this is a super vaccine and perhaps too good to be true.",0
"""On the July 11, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Republican strategist Ed Gillespie sought to contrast favorably economic performance under President George W. Bush to that under President Barack Obama. Gillespie -- a former top aide to Bush -- said """"the fact is, under the Bush tax cuts, we did have 52 months of ... uninterrupted job creation, longest in the history of the country, and revenues were at an all-time high in 2007. The problem wasn't lack of revenue. The problem still remains today too much federal spending, and this administration's not addressing that."""" We thought it would be worth checking two of Gillespie's claims. • Did Bush preside over 52 months of uninterrupted job creation? Close, but not quite. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months between September 2003 and December 2007. The economy lost jobs over two months during that stretch -- between June 2007 and July 2007 (20,000 jobs) and between July 2007 and August 2007 (71,000). That falls slightly short of being """"uninterrupted."""" Gillespie would have been correct if he'd said that jobs grew for 46 consecutive months. We might add that over the course of Bush's presidency -- a total of 96 months -- the economy created 1.08 million jobs. That may sound like a lot, but compared to every other post-World War II president prior to Obama, it's the lowest average annual percentage increase in jobs created. (See our calculations here.) That said, Obama's figures are worse than any of his postwar predecessors'. The economy has shed between 2.4 million and 3.1 million jobs during the 18 months he's been in office, depending on whether you start counting with the January 2009 figures or the February 2009 figures. • Were revenues at an all-time high in 2007? Strictly speaking, yes. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, total federal tax receipts hit $2.57 trillion in 2007, before declining in 2008 and 2009, when the current recession was under way. (Tax revenues almost always sink during a recession.) The 2007 level was the highest recorded since 1934, when statistics were first collected. So on that score, Gillespie's right. But using this particular statistic neglects a key factor -- the size of the economy as a whole. Though recessions and expansions produce volatility in tax collections, as do changes in tax policy, one would expect that a bigger economy would generally produce greater tax revenues than a smaller one. And indeed, in the 57 tax years between 1951 and 2007, tax collections grew 49 times on a year-to-year basis -- a consistent trend despite frequent changes in tax rates and periodic recessions. You can easily factor out the size of the U.S. economy if you divide revenue by gross domestic product, or GDP. The Tax Policy Center has also calculated these numbers. In 2007, tax revenues represented 18.5 percent of GDP. That's high by historical standards but hardly a record. It only ties for 16th place going back to 1934, and within the 14-year stretch between 1996 and 2009 it only rises to 7th place. So if Gillespie's point is that Bush's tax cuts led to record revenues, they did -- for 2007 at least -- but that was a record aided by a the largest, non-recession economy in American history. Ultimately, Gillespie two comments are generally accurate, but they would have benefited from some additional historical context. We realize that this is not always possible during a fast-paced television show, so on balance.""",0
"Golfrid Siregar, an activist with the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), was discovered by a pedicab driver lying unconscious on the side of a road in the city of Medan on Sumatra island last Thursday, police said. He was brought to hospital but died three days later, police said. Police initially said it appeared to be a traffic accident, but on Thursday Medan’s chief detective, Eko Hartanto, said three men, including the pedicab driver, had become suspects for stealing the victim’s belongings, state news agency Antara reported. “We have also done a reenactment of the crime scene to find what exactly caused his death,” the news agency cited Hartanto as saying. Walhi said in a statement this week that Siregar suffered injuries to his head that appeared to come from a blunt object but there were no wounds on other parts of his body. His bag, laptop, wallet and phone were missing, it said. In a joint news conference in Jakarta on Thursday, Amnesty International Indonesia researcher Papang Hidayat said there should be an independent investigation “because the victim had raised cases on environmental and human rights crimes against local people, whose network of perpetrators don’t only involve corporations but also the state apparatus”. Human rights lawyer Muhamad Isnur also questioned why Siregar’s motorbike had not be stolen if his death resulted from  a robbery. Police detective Hartanto and a North Sumatra police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Siregar had been involved in various projects in recent years, including helping fishermen in a lawsuit against a sand miner and assisting residents in a fight against forest encroachment, said Walhi’s head of advocacy, Zenzi Suhadi. According to Suhadi, his latest and most high-profile case was representing Walhi in its legal challenge to stop the construction of a $1.5 billion China-funded hydro dam, which some experts had warned would destroy the habitat of orangutans. North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE), which owns the dam project, said by text message: “We are requesting all parties not to speculate and connect PT NSHE directly or indirectly to the death of Golfrid Siregar ... until the results of a police investigation come out”.",0
"The second group of 10 Democratic presidential candidates made false and misleading claims about immigration, gun control legislation and the environment, and repeated familiar talking points on taxes, health care and poverty.Night two of the primary election debates, on June 27, was again hosted by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.Former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed President Trump “immediately discontinued” an aid program to Central America, and implied that’s the cause of surging immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border.In fact, the Obama-era aid program was reduced only about 23 percent during Trump’s first two years, while illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels than before the Obama aid program commenced. Trump has already relented on a recent threat to cut off the aid entirely.Biden: I’m the guy that got a bipartisan agreement … to spend $740 million to deal with the [border] problem, and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working.We saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was abated. And along came this president, and he said — he immediately discontinued that.Biden was referring to the “U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America,” which began under Obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a June 12 report by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. (See Table 5, page 13. )Appropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began Oct. 1, 2016, before Trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.From there, appropriations fell further to an estimated $527.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That’s a reduction of just under 23 percent.Trump’s budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million — which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under Obama.In March, however, Trump told reporters, “I’ve ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras, and to El Salvador. No money goes there anymore.” He directed the State Department to withhold appropriated aid funds. But that was a response to — not a cause of — the renewed surge in immigration.At the time Trump spoke, March apprehensions of immigrants illegally attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border were surging to 92,840, more than triple the level of March 2015, prior to the aid program to which Biden referred. Far from being “abated,” the “crisis” of which Biden spoke had come back with a vengeance.Trump has since relented on his threat. On June 18 — after widespread criticism — his administration said it would go ahead with $432 million in projects and grants that had been previously approved — out of the $615 million in aid that Trump had ordered to be frozen. Two candidates, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Sen. Bernie Sanders, mentioned time frames in their discussions of climate change that could use some additional context. Hickenlooper, who studied to be a geologist, and is a two-term former governor of Colorado, said in response to a question about climate change, “I share the sense of urgency. I’m a scientist, so I recognize that we’re within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage.”Sanders later said, “The scientists tell us we are 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet.”The 12-year figure is frequently mentioned by the press and politicians, and is extrapolated from a 2018 special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found that global warming “is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.” The world has already warmed about 1 degree Celsius.The report also concluded that to stave off warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and avoid the many climate change effects — the world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and be net-zero by 2050.In 2018, that statement was taken by many to mean there were only 12 years left to do something about climate change. But many scientists have since come forward to say that’s the wrong way of thinking about it.Myles Allen, an author of the IPCC report and the leader of the ECI Climate Research Programme at the University of Oxford, explained in a Conversation story he wrote in April that the IPCC’s timing is only a best estimate.“Please stop saying something globally bad is going to happen in 2030,” he wrote. “Bad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters, but the IPCC does not draw a ‘planetary boundary’ at 1.5°C beyond which lie climate dragons.”Kristie L. Ebi, director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington in Seattle, told the AP, “This has been a persistent source of confusion,” adding, “The report never said we only have 12 years left.”And Kate Marvel, a NASA climate scientist, told Axios in January, “12 years isn’t a deadline, and climate change isn’t a cliff we fall off — it’s a slope we slide down.” She added, “We don’t have 12 years to prevent climate change — we have no time. It’s already here. And even under a business-as-usual scenario, the world isn’t going to end in exactly twelve years.”Sanders repeated the same misleading claim about the Republican tax law that he and other Democrats have recited since the law passed at the end of 2017.Sanders said during the debate, “83% of your tax benefits go to the 1%.”But that won’t be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes will have expired.We’ve written about this claim before — when Sanders said it during a CNN town hall and when Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it shortly after the law passed.Sen. Kamala Harris also partly echoed the claim during the debate, saying that she would repeal the “tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country.”Most of the individual income tax provisions expire after 2025, which will shift most of the tax benefits to the top 1%. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the top 1% of income earners would get 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018. That percentage would go up to 25.3% in 2025 and then jump to 82.8% in 2027.Before the law was passed, Republicans said that they expected a future Congress to extend the individual income tax cuts, instead of allowing taxes for many to increase. They structured the law that way so they could pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the Senate, which meant that Republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Also, they couldn’t have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.So, while it will be true that 83% of the tax cut benefits will go to the top 1% of income earners in 2027 if Congress doesn’t act before then, it is misleading to give that statistic without context.Pushing back against President Trump’s claims that the economy is doing great, Sen. Kamala Harris said, “Well yeah, people in America are working — they’re working two and three jobs.” The percentage of American workers who hold multiple jobs is virtually unchanged from when Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Harris: I’m meeting people who are working two and three jobs — you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right — my great economy, my great economy … You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours? And they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well yeah people in America are working — they’re working two and three jobs.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 7,855,000 people who held multiple jobs in May, or 5 percent of all those who are employed. That percentage has remained virtually unchanged during Trump’s presidency — it was 4.9 percent in January 2017 when he took office. In fact, the percentage of the employed working multiple jobs has hovered around 5 percent since late 2009, and it’s lower than the roughly 6 percent of workers who held multiple jobs during the late 1990s.Looking deeper into the 7,855,000 who held multiple jobs in May, the majority — 4.4 million — were people with full-time jobs who had a secondary part-time job, according to a BLS news release (See Table A-18). Another nearly 2 million had two part-time jobs, and about 325,000 held two full-time jobs.We looked into a similar claim last July when then-congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrongly claimed that the low U.S. unemployment rate was “because everyone has two jobs.” The number of people holding more than one job has no bearing on the unemployment rate.In one of the most contentious moments of the debate, Harris confronted Biden on two race-related issues: Biden’s past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with “some civility” in the 1970s with two segregationist southern Democrats, Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.Harris, who is black, accurately noted that Biden “worked with them to oppose busing,” and told the story of her own school integration experience as an elementary student. As we have written, Berkeley public schools in California began busing students to fully integrate the school district in 1968, and Harris began attending Thousands Oaks Elementary School in 1970.Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, accused Harris of “a mischaracterization of my position across the board.” In telling her personal story, Harris left out a key detail: It was the local school district’s decision to integrate its schools.The former vice president said he opposed busing “ordered by the Department of Education,” or what critics called “forced busing,” in the 1970s. “You would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council,” Biden said. In fact, Harris was attending an integrated school before Biden even joined the Senate.But Harris did not mischaracterize Biden’s comments about Eastland and Talmadge, so she did not mischaracterize his position “across the board.”Harris said “it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.” Biden responded by saying, “I did not praise racists.” Harris didn’t say he did. She said he talked about their reputations, and Biden did say that he was able to work with them in a civil way to get things done in the Senate, despite their political and personal differences.At a June 18 fundraiser in New York, Biden described Talmadge as “one of the meanest guys I ever knew,” and said Eastland referred to him as “son” instead of senator, which he took as a sign of disrespect.But, in comparison to the current political climate in Washington, Biden went on to say: “At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.”Rep. Eric Swalwell, trying to distinguish himself from the other candidates on gun issues, said he was “the only person on stage who has voted and passed background checks.”That’s clearly false. Biden, for example, was in the Senate in 1993 and voted for the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which became law. It requires federally licensed firearms dealers to conduct background checks on most gun transfers to prospective buyers.Swalwell’s campaign explained that the California congressman meant he “was the only person on stage who has voted for and passed universal background checks.”That’s true, but still misleading.Swalwell did vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act that passed the Democratic-controlled House by a vote of 240-190 in February. The legislation, according to the Congressional Research Service, expands background check requirements by prohibiting a firearm transfer between unlicensed individuals “unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.”However, four other people on the debate stage — Sanders, Harris, Sen. Michael Bennet and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand — are all co-sponsors of the Background Check Expansion Act, which would “expand federal background checks to all gun sales,” according to lawmakers who reintroduced the bill in January. (Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, who were in the previous night’s debate, are also co-sponsors. )But because the Senate is currently controlled by Republicans, that bill has virtually no chance at passing in the chamber.After being asked about his concerns about “embracing socialism,” Hickenlooper misrepresented the Green New Deal, objecting to a provision in the legislation that doesn’t exist. “I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change — I’m a scientist,” he said, “but we can’t promise every American a government job.”The Green New Deal, which we’ve written about before, is a nonbinding resolution that aims to tackle climate change while ensuring job security, health care and protecting vulnerable communities.The Green New Deal doesn’t promise every American a position in the government. Instead, it guarantees “a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.”The resolution was introduced into both chambers of Congress in February, and is most closely associated with New York freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In March, the resolution did not advance in the Senate, after nearly all Democrats voted “present.”Sanders claimed that Trump tried to “throw 32 million people off their health care that they have,” a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if Congress repealed the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. As we’ve written before, it’s misleading to say 32 million would all be thrown off.Trump supported a partial repeal-and-replace bill in the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which wasn’t expected to have as big of an impact on the uninsured. But he also backed an immediate repeal of the ACA, with a replacement at a “later date.”In 2017 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, a bill that would fit that description,  would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years. But not all of them would be thrown off their insurance. CBO said: “In the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.”The ACA imposed a tax penalty, known as the mandate, on those without health insurance, but the Republican tax law repealed that penalty as of Jan. 1 of this year. It’s worth noting that in May 2018, the CBO revised downward its estimate of the impact of repealing the mandate.In his closing statement, Sanders said he suspects “people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people, they have great ideas, but how come nothing really changes?”He then posed several questions, including, “How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty?”That’s an unchanging — and false — Sanders claim. We debunked it twice during his 2016 presidential run.A 2017 report by the United Nations Children’s Fund, or UNICEF, did note that the United States is above average when it comes to the “relative child poverty” rate — which “shows the proportion of each nation’s children living in a household where disposable income is less than 60% of the national median.”But the report did not indicate the U.S. had the “highest” rate. The country ranked No. 7 out of 41 rich countries, behind Romania, Israel, Turkey and others.The U.S. Census Bureau pegged the 2017 poverty rate for those under age 18 at 17.5 percent (see Table 3), which is the lowest it’s been since 2006.The bureau also calculates the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which accounts for government programs that assist low-income families and are not considered in the official poverty measure. The SPM rate for children in 2017 was 15.6 percent.Update, July 3: We amended our story to note that Sen. Kamala Harris began attending Thousand Oaks Elementary School, a public school in Berkeley, California, in 1970, according to her campaign.

"The singer Chris Brown’s violent physical abuse of his one-time girlfriend, fellow singer and pop star Rihanna, was one of the most high-profile episodes of domestic violence in recent years, and one which raised awareness about the nature and consequences of that crime throughout the world. That made it particularly shocking to many observers when the social networking app Snapchat hosted a mobile game commercial which made light of Rihanna’s abuse at the hands of Brown. The advertisement for the game Would You Rather? invited viewers to choose to “Slap Rihanna” or “Punch Chris Brown.” Is it just me, or is this ad that popped up on my Snapchat extremely tone deaf? Like what were they thinking with this? pic.twitter.com/7kP9RHcgNG — Royce Mann (@TheRoyceMann) March 12, 2018  According to National Public Radio, the company behind Snapchat apologized and removed the commercial from circulation by 12 March 2018, but screengrabs of it had already begun to spread. On 15 March, Rihanna herself criticized the app for hosting the commercial in an Instagram post that has since been deleted: …I’m just trying to figure out what the point was with this mess! I’d love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain’t that dumb! You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV [domestic violence] victims and made a joke of it!!! This isn’t about my personal feelings, cause I don’t have much of them…but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven’t made it out yet…you let us down! Shame on you. The star then appeared to encourage her 61 million Instagram followers to delete the Snapchat app, urging: “Throw the whole app-oligy away.” If she tells me to delete snapchat I’ll do it @rihanna pic.twitter.com/yUW1UOzNc2 — Nicollette Williams (@nicollettemw) March 15, 2018  Rihanna’s critical intervention appears to have been an event that sparked a selloff of shares in Snap, Inc. the company behind the app, prompting a whole ecosystem of viral social media posts and news articles in response. On 15 March 2018, the company’s share value dropped by 3.64 percent, the equivalent of roughly $754 million. While not unprecedented (it was only the 26th-biggest one-day percentage drop in value in the last year), this was a significant decline. Since March 2017, the average (median) one-day percentage loss in Snapchat’s market value has been -0.34 percent, so the devaluation seen on 15 March was substantial. On a day where there was no other major bad news for Snapchat, the evidence is very strong that Rihanna’s message to “throw away” the app (delivered instantly to 61 million people), as well as the ensuing media coverage, at the very least made a significant contribution to the nearly $800 million one-day loss.",0
"No mention of the cost of these Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker drugs. They are typically more expensive than other anti-hypertensive medications, but there is no mention of the cost of taking this medication daily for prevention of hypertension. Also, there is no comparison of ARB treatment with less costly anti-hypertensive medications such a diuretics, or a cost comparison with lifestyle modification. The story gives some basic quantification of the benefits of treatment, but no relative or absolute risk reduction was provided, though they are available in the journal article. Benefits were oversimplified. No mention of side effects of the drug. The most common side effects of ARBs are cough, elevated potassium levels, low blood pressure, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, abnormal taste sensation (metallic or salty taste), and rash. In this study, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness and headaches were more common in the treatment group, though in most cases, the difference was small. There were no mention of the question of long-term safety of being on these medications for years as prevention. There is mention of the study design, but no mention that it was double-blinded. There was still some modest protective benefit in the treatment group at 4 years (absolute reduction 9.8%), though the story said that “they matched the placebo group”. This story represents a classic case of disease mongering. The classification of “prehypertension” (systolic 130-139 mm Hg and 85-89 mm Hg diastolic) is still debatable by some medical experts, and whether prehypertension alone is a strong predictor of future heart disease is also debatable. Blood pressure increases as a natural part of aging, so whether prehypertension or mild hypertension should be viewed as a condition or disease and treated with costly medication needs further study. Hypertension is only one of several risk factors that contributes to heart disease. A prehypertensive or mildly hypertensive person with low risk factors and a healthy lifestyle may not benefit from pharmaceutical treatment as much as someone with greater risk of heart disease and unhealthy behaviors such as a poor diet, lack of exercise and smoking. There is no discussion of the controversies surrounding these issues. The story mentions that makers of the anti-hypertensive medication sponsored and help design the study. The lead author also serves as a consultant to the drug company and has other grant support from the makers of the drug, which was not disclosed. Nonetheless, we give this a satisfactory score. Advantages/disadvantages of lifestyle and medication not adequately covered. The story mentions lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as a “cornerstone of controlling blood pressure”, however, comparison is only anecdotal and no mention of studies on the effect of lifestyle modification for reducing prehypertensive or hypertensive blood pressure. The story mentions limiting salt and water. A reduced sodium diet may help manage hypertension, but reducing water will not help most people decrease blood pressure. Treatment of prehypertention to prevent hypertension is currently only being studied in clinical trials such as the one described in this article. The story describes a trial of anti-hypertensive therapy with candesartan, an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), to prevent hypertension in prehypertensive people. But it offers no information about whether this is a new drug. No evidence this is from a press release. There are sources cited other than study authors.",1
"Photographs of various fruits accompanied by long lists of chemicals crafted in the style of ingredients labels have been a fixture on the internet since at least 2013, when they were created by James Kennedy, a high school chemistry teacher in Melbourne, Australia. His take on the banana is especially popular: This graphic is an accurate representation of the chemical constituents of your average banana, information that can be verified with the USDA Agricultural Research Database, which compiles studies into the nutritional and chemical content of various food items. Part of what Kennedy was trying to convey with his illustration was that even completely natural foods, when described scientifically, can sound unnatural and potentially unhealthy, as reported in the New York Times:  As a high-school chemistry teacher, I made these posters for my students as a visual introduction to our organic chemistry course. I want to erode the fear that many people have of ‘chemicals’, and demonstrate that nature evolves compounds, mechanisms and structures far more complicated and unpredictable than anything we can produce in the lab. This poster series breaks down all the major ingredients in popular natural foods — using E-numbers and IUPAC names instead of common names where they exist. Anthocynanins, for example, which are said to give blueberries their “superfood” status, are also known as E163. If these ingredients are considered hierarchically, the banana sounds much more simple. Like all fruit, it contains water, sugars, starch, fiber, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals (i.e., ash), and chemicals that impart their coloring. Myriad names can be ascribed to the various different chemicals that fit these groups, and Kennedy used a variety of different nomenclatural methods to make that point. The most common grouping of chemicals in the banana are sugars, and in this case the sugars are predominantly glucose and fructose, with lesser amounts of sucrose and maltose. After starch, a polysaccharide chemical found in abundance in plants, the next listed set of chemicals is fiber, another common group of carbohydrate chemicals. Kennedy represented the fiber as a group of chemicals listed by their “E numbers”, which are codes assigned to substances permitted as food additives within the European Union. In reality, all of these chemicals are either cellulose (the most common chemical in plants) or various breakdown products of cellulose: After the fiber, Kennedy listed amino acids, a group of simple chemicals ubiquitous to life on this planet. All the chemicals listed are present in bananas, according to the USDA. Fatty acids, the next group of chemicals, are similarly ubiquitous in nature, and all of those chemicals listed above are also found in bananas. Likewise, ash is another way of referring to the mineral content of a food item, and in this case Kennedy used a variety of different chemical-naming conventions to obscure the fact that each of them is commonly known by other names: Similarly, the coloring agents — all of which are natural — might be better recognized by different names: The remaining chemicals may sound intimidating, but they too are natural. E1510 is another name for ethanol, which forms naturally as fruit ferments. The final “natural ripening agent,” ethylene gas, might sound downright nefarious but actually represents a neat intersection of plant and food science. In nature, the gas is a plant hormone associated with aging that triggers the ripening process. In the food industry, the gas is used on industrial scales to ripen a variety of fruits and vegetables all at once.",0
"In September and October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of reports that claimed U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren had said or argued to the effect that “taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.” On Aug. 14, the right-leaning website OneNewsNow published an article with the headline, “Warren: Taxpayers Must Fund Sex Reassignment Surgery,” which reported that: “Democratic presidential primary candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) launched her fight via social media to have taxpayer dollars fund ‘gender-affirming healthcare’ so that transgender Americans can have ‘free’ sex-changing surgery. “‘Everyone should be able to access high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care, but the Trump administration is trying to roll back important protections for trans Americans,’ Warren tweeted Tuesday. ‘Help fight back by leaving a comment for HHS in protest. '” Everyone should be able to access high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care. But the Trump administration is trying to roll back important protections for trans Americans. Help fight back by leaving a comment for HHS in protest: https://t.co/pKDcOqbsc7 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 13, 2019   Warren’s tweet included a link to the website Protect Trans Health, a campaign run by the Transgender Law Center and the National Center for Transgender Equality. The purpose of that campaign was to solicit and convey criticism to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) about its controversial move to repeal an Obama-era rule that prohibits healthcare and insurance providers from discriminating against trans individuals. So the source cited by OneNewsNow did not involve Warren saying, “Taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.” The phrasing of the website’s headline may have given some readers the impression it was a direct quote, even though OneNewsNow did not actually use quotation marks. It might also have led some to believe Warren had proposed that all sex-reassignment surgeries must be taxpayer-funded, which is not the case. Nonetheless, an examination of the record, and confirmation from Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign, make it clear that she does indeed support covering sex-reassignment surgery under taxpayer-funded programs like Medicaid, as well as full legal access to the surgery, under private health insurance and Obamacare. We asked the Warren campaign whether she supports gender-reassignment surgery, and other transition-related services such as medication, being made available at low cost or no cost, under taxpayer-funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare (for military service members and veterans), as well as through Obamacare and private health insurance policies. A campaign spokesperson was unequivocal in response: “Yes.”  The campaign also directed us to a September 2019 interview Warren conducted with “HIV Plus” magazine, in which she gave further details about her stance on the issue. The interview refers to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), so a brief explanation is warranted. Section 1557 incorporated existing anti-discrimination law into the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It prohibited healthcare or insurance providers that receive federal funding (include state-by-state Medicaid programs) from discriminating against patients on the basis of their sex, race, religion, national origin, and so on. In 2016, HHS under President Barack Obama implemented a new rule that expanded those protections from discrimination and, most notably, defined sex discrimination as including discrimination on the basis of a patient’s gender identity, as well as their having previously terminated a pregnancy, among other changes. Federally funded healthcare and insurance providers (including state Medicaid programs) could not deny services or treatment access to individuals on the basis of their gender identity, and could not categorically refuse to cover treatments related to gender transition, such as sex-reassignment surgery. In May 2019, HHS under President Donald Trump proposed another new rule that would largely reverse the Section 1557 expansions brought by the Obama administration, removing gender identity and pregnancy termination from the definition of sex discrimination. It would also add an explicit religious freedom exemption from the requirements of Section 1557. The department wrote in a press release: “In 2016, HHS issued a new rule that redefined discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity which it defined as one’s internal sense of being ‘male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.’ In response to a subsequent lawsuit by several states and healthcare entities, on December 31, 2016, a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule’s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis, finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. “A second federal court agreed. Because the preliminary injunction continues to be in effect, HHS cannot, and has not since the date of the injunction, enforced the rule’s provisions the court said are likely unlawful. The proposed rule would revise the provisions subject to those injunctions to conform with the plain understanding recognized by the court.” With that context and background in mind, the following is the most relevant exchange from Warren’s September 2019 interview with “HIV Plus” magazine: Interviewer:…If elected, would you support a reinterpretation of Section 1557 of the ACA as covering transgender people and champion the passage of the Equality Act? How would you protect the rights, well-being, and lives of transgender people living in this country, while ensuring that they receive the healthcare and housing necessary to be virally suppressed?” Warren: Discrimination against transgender Americans is unconstitutional and we need to fight back. HHS’s proposed reinterpretation of Section 1557 rolls back critical nondiscrimination protections, allowing health insurance companies to refuse to cover and health care providers to deny health services to transgender people, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, and to those who have had or are seeking an abortion. It also removes requirements to make information language-accessible, which will harm transgender immigrants. As President, I will direct HHS to interpret Section 1557 under its 2016 guidance, to fully uphold civil rights and nondiscrimination protections. I will also direct the CDC to collect accurate data on the health of transgender people and am a co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender individuals in health care and housing. Warren’s declaration that she would as president “direct HHS to interpret Section 1557 under its 2016 guidance” means she would enforce, once again, a set of rules that mean sex-reassignment surgery would be covered under federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, including state-by-state Medicaid programs. As such, it is accurate to claim that Warren does propose and has proposed that taxpayers should cover the cost of some sex-reassignment surgeries, as they do other treatments and services, under those programs. Warren was also one of 31 U.S. Senators who signed on to a June 2019 letter to Trump’s HHS, which opposed and criticized the proposed reversal of the 2016 anti-discrimination enhancements. Warren was joined in signing that latter by fellow presidential candidates and U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker. Warren has therefore put on the record, several times in 2019, her support for sex-reassignment surgery being included among the treatments and services covered under taxpayer-funded programs, as well as under Obamacare and private health insurance policies. However, the OneNewsNetwork headline had a tendency to mislead some readers who may have interpreted its phrasing to mean that Warren had said, word-for-word, “taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery,” or that she had advocated taxpayers must fund any and all sex reassignment surgery, rather than simply adding one more procedure to the list of procedures taxpayers already fund under Medicaid and similar federal programs.",0
"""Failing test scores aren't the only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problem is, well, more colorful: tattoos. While talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants. Bush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge: """"In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now that’s not just because of the test, that’s also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers."""" PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both ). But we hadn’t explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldn’t resist taking a look. Tattoo policies Each branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Army’s policy that has drawn the most ink recently from the media. In March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about """"tattoo, branding and body mutilation."""" This led to a rush to get tatted so soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum. The Army’s policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as """"anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears."""" """"Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee,"""" the policy says. So far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos, said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. """"Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver,"""" he said. In the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending. Lepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants. News reports around the country indicate the tattoo policy is limiting applicants, though. """"Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door,"""" U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso. Maj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Star in August that the policy is, """"rather arbitrary, in some sense."""" However he said that """"you have to draw the line somewhere"""" for the Army to present a professional image. As for waivers, Batschelet said, """"To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo."""" The Air Force, Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views. The Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.) The Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed. The Navy’s policy is the least detailed -- only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos. Our ruling Bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have """"too many tattoos"""" on visible body parts. Since the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military.""",0
"On 4 May 2017, the America’s Last Line of Defense web site (and numerous related shill sites) published an article positing that former Fox News Channel host Bill O’Reilly, who had recently parted ways with Fox in the wake of accusations of sexual harassment, had been hospitalized in New York after being beaten by a group of cowardly “liberals” who accosted him at a bagel shop: Bill O’Reilly was reportedly at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was approached by two women and three men who said they were “disgusted” by his behavior towards women at Fox News. O’Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That’s when the “tolerant” liberals got violent. One of the men grabbed O’Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help. O’Reilly was taken to St. Vincent’s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. The doctors are hopeful. None of this was true: No legitimate news outlet reported that Bill O’Reilly was beaten or hospitalized, and he continues hosting his “No Spin” material via his new podcasting venture.",1
"The story did explain that “The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with (NSAIDS or birth control pills).”  It didn’t give a ballpark cost, but we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt for nodding in the direction of addressing cost. The article states that pain was reduced in the experimental group by 41% (where the control group experienced no pain reductions), but 41% of what? And in reality, was this reduction significant enough that women were able to resume their normal level of activity? The article did not talk about any harms related to high doses of Vitamin D.  They did point out that the women in the study already had low levels of Vitamin D so it is unclear if receiving Vitamin D in lower doses would have been just as beneficial. The study ended follow up at two months and did not have information regarding possible long-term follow-up. They also pointed out that larger clinical trials were needed. The lead in to the story hinges on disease-mongering with its “bane of many women” description, but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt. The story included interviews with other doctors not associated with the study and reported their viewpoints regarding the study findings. The article did talk about NSAIDs and birth control pills as other alternatives to help alleviate menstrual cramps. The story could have done a better job on this point. Although Vitamin D is available over the counter, it is available in the high dose used in the study only by prescription. Just to put this dose issue in context, when people are Vitamin D deficient, a typical replacement dose is 50,000 units weekly for 8 weeks (a total of 400,000 units). So the 300,000 one-time doses are not as outlandish as they seem when compared with a typical maintenance dose of 600-800 IU/day. The story actually didn’t make any claims about the novelty of this area of research. Vitamin D at this dosage and for this condition are novel approaches. The article does not appear to be based solely on a press release.",0
"Vaccine pricing is complicated and prices are unknown at this point in development (pre-clinical). The story could have addressed cost as a potential limitation even if price is unknown at this time. The story is very clear in giving data on the increased antibody levels among study participants getting either of the two vaccines, or the placebo. However, readers of stories about potential vaccines basically want to know if the vaccines will actually prevent the disease, and this trial was only able to show that the vaccines increased a person’s antibody response. The story does, to its credit, include a statement from one expert stating that it isn’t known what level of antibody response is needed to protect against the disease. The story includes potential harms from the vaccines: “The level of serious adverse events was higher in the placebo group than either vaccine group, and ‘most of the serious adverse events were attributed to malaria. '” The story appropriately states that this was the “first placebo-controlled study of two vaccines against the Ebola virus.” It is also clear in pointing to the study’s shortcomings, offering several different limitations, such as “Ebola cases in Liberia began to dwindle early in 2015, and the outbreak there was declared over on May 9 of that year. By the time this work was fully under way, it was too late to see if vaccines actually prevented Ebola sickness and death.” To the reporter’s credit, no disease mongering. The story included information from an unaffiliated expert, and it alerts readers that pharmaceutical companies developed the two vaccines. That’s good reporting and useful context. However, the story also says that the latest study was conducted by the “U.S. and Liberian governments and elsewhere,” while neglecting to mention that “elsewhere” includes GlaxoSmithKline and Merck (which employs several of the researchers). The story also doesn’t mention that several of the researchers have other economic ties to the companies. This one’s a close call, but there’s not quite enough information to clear our bar. We’ll give story a not applicable in this category since there currently is no proven successful treatment against Ebola. The availability of an Ebola vaccine would be reasonable to address. For example, it a new epidemic developed today, would one of these vaccines be used? This is an important clinical point that researchers might have been able to provide information about. Since hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola are so deadly, the possibility of new vaccines that might be successful against them is certainly novel enough for a story. In this case, it reports a strong antibody response against the virus suggesting a possible protection against an often-fatal disease. The story does a good job of putting the new studies in context. This story does not appear to rely on a news release.",0
"In 2008, US children got 36 vaccines and the autism rate was 1 in 150. US children were recommended to get around 13 vaccines, which involved about 39 doses, in 2008.

US children were recommended to get around 13 vaccines, which involved about 53 doses, in 2013. In 2012, 1 in 69 were estimated to have autism disorders and in 2014, it was 1 in 59 (we found no figures for 2013). Increasing numbers of vaccines are associated with increasing rates of autism.

"In July 2017, a video purportedly showing “a bolt of lightning striking a river” went viral on social media:   Meteorologist Dan Skoff lent credence to the claim when he reposted the video on Facebook, along with the following message: This is crazy! One of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen with lightning. Almost doesn’t look real! If you aren’t terrified of lightning in a swimming pool, you will be now! This video, however, does not actually show a bolt of lightning striking a river. When the video is slowed down, it is easy to tell that the “lightning” strike doesn’t come from the sky, but from a wire on the hill. Here’s a screenshot showing the moment of impact (which can be glimpsed at the 7-second mark in the video above):  This video was uploaded to YouTube by Finnish water engineering company Rannikon Merityö in 2012, under the title “Porapaalutusta, osa 3: Räjäytys” (Drilling rig, part 3: Blasting). Although this clip was not accompanied by any additional information, the video was included on the company’s web site on a page about underwater mining and blasting: KÄÄNNY VEDENALAISESSA LOUHINTA JA RÄJÄYTYSTYÖSSÄ AINA ASIANTUNTIJAN PUOLEEN Rantojen ja vedenalaisen kallion louhinta- ja rakennustyö Turun saaristossa ja ympäristössä.

TAKE SUBMERGED MINING AND BLASTING WORK TO AN EXPERT Mining and construction of beaches and underwater rock in Turku archipelago and surroundings. Underwater quarrying lowers the rock surface level in the lake, ocean or other waters. Before the excavation work is started, a mining and blasting plan is planned to ensure that everything is safely accomplished. The rock mining in water is licensed and may require the permission of the regional government agency (AVI). WHERE IS UNDERWATER MINING SUITABLE? Underwater quarrying is used for the refurbishment of beaches and waterways and the creation of sea symbols. In addition, the deepening, construction and maintenance of waterways are carried out in mining and blasting operations. Extraction is carried out by inserting underwater special explosives into the drilling holes, which are immersed in drilled holes in the rock. Customers can be private customers, ports, and marinas. As several pieces of debris can be seen floating in the river shortly after the explosion, it seems most likely that Rannikon Merityö used a detonation cord to dislodge a stump or a tree from the river. Regardless of the exact reason for this explosion, it’s clear that this video shows the work of a dredging company, not a bolt of lightning. Meteorologist Skoff later updated his Facebook post to note that the video did not actually show a bolt of lightning striking a river: This is crazy! It’s not lightning, BUT instead a detonation cord! There is no flash from the clouds & the bolt just seems to come from the top of the hill. They probably had some explosives detonate under water. Still cool though. A similar explosion can be seen in the following video showing the removal of the City Mill Dam in the U.S. state of Georgia’s Chattahoochee River. An almost identical “lightning bolt” can be seen flashing across the water at the 1:30 mark:",1
"Although the release’s lead emphasizes efforts to bring this blood test to market, there are no cost estimates in the text. A source affiliated with the company that licensed the test is quoted as valuing the maintenance of “affordable cost,” but we have no idea what that might mean. The release states that a modified version of the original test can identify individuals with cancer more than 93% of the time. It’s unclear what the 93% success rate means in this context. Is that the sensitivity? What is the false positive rate? Why these terms matter. The release needed to provide more information on the risks that arise with cancer screening tests–for example, of being told you have cancer when you do not; or the opposite, being told you’re cancer-free when you actually have cancer. There is also the risk of overdiagnosis — finding and treating non-growing or slow-growing cancer that doesn’t need to be treated. The release needed more about the limitations to this research. It appears the test has only been run on people where their cancer status is known, for example. A prospective trial needs to be conducted. Also, it’s not known whether earlier diagnosis will make any difference or cause more harm than good. Blood tests to detect cancer would provide a significant opportunity to find cancers at an early stage, when they can possibly (but not necessarily) be successfully treated. But, as we mentioned, the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment needs to be acknowledged. While it is not clear who is funding this latest study, the company, IMSTAR, which has licensed the test, identifies the University of Bradford as a “partner” on its website. Additionally, the PI quoted most extensively in the release appears to co-own a 2010 patent for a similar test. The news release did attempt to explain alternatives. More could have been said about this, but we found it sufficient for a satisfactory rating: Professor Anderson said: “This test is different from other universal cancer tests being developed, because it is not looking for a specific biomarker or mutation. This is a generic test for cancer in an individual, regardless of the underlying mechanism that’s causing their cancer.” The text offers only a general statement at its end indicating that work to develop the test will continue. Ideally the release would have explained that a prospective trial is still needed. The release establishes what makes this test unique. The text exercises appropriate caution, describing the blood test as a “potential” tool.",1
"In mid-February 2018, an inflammatory quote attributed to Tariq Ramadan, a prominent and controversial Islamic studies scholar recently arrested on rape charges in France, reappeared on social media:  The Swiss-born scholar has for years has been a controversial figure in part because of his lineage (he is the grandson of Hassan Al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood movement) and in part because of his views on the role of Islam in the Western world. We found no evidence that Ramadan ever made the statement attributed to him above. In 2004, the George W. Bush administration barred Ramadan from entering the U.S. over allegations he had donated to a charity that gives money to the Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist organization Hamas. The restriction on Ramadan’s entry was lifted in 2010. In February 2018, Ramadan made headlines for a completely different reason: he was arrested in France after two women came forward with rape allegations against him in late 2017, during what has become known as the #MeToo movement. It’s unclear whether the rape charges prompted the fake quote’s resurgence, but the latter has wended its way across the Internet by way of message boards and web sites with no links back to a source for it. The quote appears to have originated on the anti-Muslim site BareNakedIslam.com, where it appeared in a 2015 post alongside a video commentary by Marc Lebuis, the founder of a French-Canadian web site whose mission is to “explore and expose Islamist activities in our midst.” The quote is a mishmash of Ramadan’s words and Lebuis’s paraphrases. In the video, Lebuis said that “Tariq Ramadan is very controversial by the way. He called on — he specifically targeted Muslims not to use Sharia law, the term Sharia, but rather targeted Canada as being one of the easiest legal systems to penetrate in order to advance Sharia principles. And that was published in an Egyptian magazine in 2004.” LeBuis was referring to a 2004 interview with Ramadan in the Cario-based news magazine Egypt Today, in which Ramadan discussed the Islamic code of conduct enshrined in the law of some predominantly Muslim countries known as Sharia law. The idea of a sneaky takeover plot to implement Sharia law in Western countries such as Canada and the United States is popular among anti-Islamic conspiracy theorists, who have developed a veritable cottage industry around that fear. But Ramadan never said anything about “colonizing” the U.S. and Canada or using violent jihad to do so. Rather, he told Egypt Today that: The Muslims in Canada’s battle to set up shariah courts to settle domestic disputes is another example of lack of creativity. Within the normative law in Canada, they have huge latitude for Muslims to propose an Islamic contract. These courts are not necessary; all they do is stress the fact that Muslims have specific laws and for the time being this is not how we want to be perceived. We need to show that our way of thinking is universal, that we can live with the law and there is no contradiction. It’s more useful for Muslims to examine the legal framework they have in Canada, which is one of the most open in the world, and come up with something Islamic that at the same time fits the Canadian reality. The term shariah in itself is laden with negative connotations in the Western mind. There is no need to stress that. We can do more and better without creating this sort of fracture and misunderstanding. The very moment Muslims understand there are no contradictions between being Muslim and being European or American, they will enrich their societies. Although Lebuis interpreted Ramadan’s comments as pushing for a takeover of the Canadian legal system, the academic was in fact advocating for the opposite, saying that Canadian Muslims could use the existing court system rather than settling disputes in separate Sharia courts. But neither man’s comments were sensational enough for BareNakedIslam, which apparently made up a quote that fit their purposes. As the fake quote and stories about the allegations against Ramadan swept far-right sites such as GellerReport.com and “Creeping Sharia,” some observers have raised questions about what it means for Muslim women when misogyny and racism collide. Muslim women have been speaking out in their own version of the MeToo movement using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo, telling their stories of assault and abuse within the religious community. Author and activist Mona Eltahawy pointed out in a November 2017 op-ed that the eagerness of Islamophobes to paint Muslim men as predators puts Muslim women in a difficult position when they come forward with accusations of sexual assault. Ayesha Chaudhry, associate professor of Islamic studies and gender studies at the University of British Columbia, discussed that double bind in phone interview with us, saying “When people are violated and are victims of assault, they can’t be expected solve systemic inequality at the same time.” Chaudhry said the Ramadan case brought to mind a motif common in stories about crimes committed by Muslim men in the Western media, and noted that once the trial starts, various forms of rarely-discussed societal oppression will play out in public: [University of California, Los Angeles women’s studies professor] Sherene Razack makes the argument of this triangle we find ourselves caught in when we talk about Muslims. There’s the dangerous Muslim man, the imperiled woman and the civilizing European, and you just see this in the Tariq Ramadan case so clearly.",1
"Even if this new drug does ultimately prove effective for preventing heart attacks, we need to know what this benefit is going to cost us. Although it may be too early to provide an exact figure, the story could at least have mentioned what treatment with other cholesterol-targeting therapies costs. An error in this story may lead readers to believe the drug is more effective for saving lives than is actually the case. The story states that there were “16 deaths in the anacetrapib group, versus 21 in patients taking a placebo.” In fact, there were 11 deaths recorded in the anacetrapib group and 8 in the placebo group during the time patients were taking the medication. The statistic referred to in the story is for a combined outcome that included cardiovascular deaths, heart attacks, hospitalization for unstable angina, or stroke. The study also used relative risk descriptions to describe the benefits attributable to statin drugs, saying they lower risk by 25-30%. We think this characterization will lead readers to overestimate the effectiveness of these drugs. The absolute reduction in heart attack risk is about 1% for statin-treated patients, and 100 patients need to be treated for 3 years to achieve a benefit. Finally, the story focuses excessively on the “unprecedented” changes in cholesterol achieved with the drug. As discussed earlier in the review (see “Why This Matters”), these are surrogate markers that may not reflect any real benefit on the outcomes that matter to patients. And the story didn’t provide data on what participants’ cholesterol levels were before and after treatment, or what levels are considered healthy. We are only told about the percentage change, which is not very useful without this additional context. Although the potential for harms was mentioned, this story didn’t provide quite enough detail to satisfy this criterion. Citing a company representative, the story states that the new drug didn’t cause the lethal side effects associated with another experimental drug that works through similar mechanisms. While this is true and important to point out, the story should also have mentioned the potential for other effects that could potentially harm patients and would limit the use of the drug. Notably, the researchers had to discontinue treatment in 17.6% of patients receiving the drug because their bad cholesterol levels dropped to a level that might be harmful. In addition, more patients died in the drug treatment group compared with the placebo group, although the story erroneously states that the opposite was the case. (See the Benefits criterion for more discussion of this). This article starts things off with a grandiose and unsubstantiated claim — that “doctors” are predicting the new drug “may conquer heart disease.” Really? Which doctors said this? And why weren’t they quoted in the story? We couldn’t find anyone in the story who said anything close to this. Based on this story’s extremely liberal paraphrasing and selection of gushing quotes, readers might come away thinking that this drug is going to help everyone avoid heart disease. But the study involved a carefully selected group of patients who were already at high risk of a heart attack because they had already had a heart attack or had various other risk factors. It’s not at all clear that this drug is going to be beneficial for patients who are at lower risk of disease, even though many of these apparently low-risk patients still get heart attacks. This study’s purpose was to test whether the new drug was safe and had the desired effect on cholesterol. It could not tell us whether the drug helps prevent heart attacks or deaths. So while we appreciate that the story had some caveats to this effect — e.g. the drug “is still experimental and must be tested in a larger trial” and  “the study wasn’t designed to test its power to prevent heart attacks” — we think there was an imbalance of cheerleading quotes and positive speculation without a more vigorous attempt to discuss the limitations of this preliminary research. Although the story raises some red flags with its emphasis on surrogate markers and overgeneralizing who might would be a candidate for treatment, these are deficiencies that we address in other sections of the review. Otherwise, there was no evidence of overt disease-mongering. The story solicits comments from multiple expert sources. We wish, however, that perspectives had been obtained from experts without ties to the drug industry. This might have turned up someone willing to put a restraining hand on this story’s excessive enthusiasm. In addition, we think the story should have mentioned the study’s source of funding (Merck, the drug’s manufacturer) and the fact that several investigators have financial relationships with the company. The story did not mention other classes of drugs that raise HDL, such as niacin and fibrates. The story states clearly that the drug is experimental and is not yet available to the public. The story makes reference to the relevant research that preceded development of the drug and mentions an “older relative” (the experimental HDL-raising drug torcetrapib) that was not approved because of an increased risk of lethal adverse effects. Although we’ll award a satisfactory, we think the story could have gone into more detail as to what happened with this “older relative” and why it failed. Some data suggest that the drug failed because it raised blood pressure — something which the new drug apparently does not do. But some researchers believe the drug may have failed because raising HDL with a drug doesn’t confer the same benefits as having naturally high HDL. Discussion of this background would have been useful. This story does not appear to be based on a news release.",1
"The California wildfires of October 2017 have prompted a series of articles falsely blaming immigrants and Muslims for starting them. On 19 October 2017, the “satirical” web site Freedom Junkshun published the completely fabricated claim that police in California had arrested Muhammad Islam, a 23-year-old Iranian immigrant. The California wildfires devastated the northern part of the state. Police initially arrested one suspect but released him after an investigation was conducted because the investigation led them to the actual person responsible for the fires: a 23-year-old man named Muhammad Islam. Islam was born in Tehran, Iran and came to the United States in 2015 on a student visa, which expired when he dropped out of Dartmouth in November 2016. None of these details are based in fact, and the Fox News report mentioned in the article also does not exist. The photograph used in the article actually shows Omar El-Abed, a 19-year-old Palestinian man accused of murdering a Jewish family in the West Bank in July 2017. Another article on Freedom Junkshun falsely claims that the fictional Muhammad Islam was seen burning the American flag at a protest in Berkeley, California. On 17 October 2017, the right-wing web site Breitbart falsely linked the arrest of Jesus Fabian Gonzalez in Sonoma County, California, with the wildfires. The article, which was republished by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s web site Infowars, falsely described Gonzalez as having been detained in connection with the wildfires, claiming he was “arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.” Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano directly refuted these claims in a press conference later that day. The relevant section of the video starts at 12.10: I want to talk about something, there’s a little rumor control issue. The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office arrested a man on Sunday [15 October] for arson, in Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There’s a story out there that he’s the arsonist for these fires – that is not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all. …Our arson case involves someone who’s known to the deputies, he frequents Maxwell Park, he’s been known to sleep there, he was walking away from…a small fire, they stopped him. He had a fire extinguisher and a lighter with him. They asked him if he started the fire [in Maxwell Park], he said he started the fire to warm himself up, something to that effect. Giordano added that he wanted to “kill that speculation right now,” referring to reports that Gonzalez’s arrest was related to the wildfires. Remarkably, something of a war of words has broken out between the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over Gonzalez’s arrest. ICE says that Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant. On 18 October, ICE issued a press release criticizing the sheriff’s office and claiming that it had lodged a “detainer” against Gonzalez (asked the county to detain him for up to 48 hours after his scheduled release date, in order to make a determination about a possible deportation). Once again, a non-cooperative jurisdiction has left their community vulnerable to dangerous individuals and preventable crimes. ICE lodged a detainer against Jesus Gonzalez with Sonoma County jail officials on October 16, following his arrest on felony charges for maliciously setting fire to a property. This is especially troubling in light of the massive wildfires already devastating the region. Over the past year, ICE has lodged detainers against Mr. Gonzalez after four separate arrests by Sonoma County on various felony and misdemeanor charges. ICE was never notified of Mr. Gonzalez’ various releases. Additionally, Mr. Gonzales has been returned to his home country of Mexico on two separate occasions. The residents of Sonoma County, and the state of California, deserve better than policies that expose them to avoidable dangers. Non-cooperation policies – now enshrined in California state law – ensure only one thing: criminals who would otherwise be deported will be released and left free to reoffend as they please. The following day, Sheriff Giordano hit back. In a message posted to Facebook, he said the detainer request was not signed by a judge and was unconstitutional, and said ICE’s press release had been “misleading” and caused fear during a major natural disaster. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a press release yesterday that was inaccurate, inflammatory, and damages the relationship we have with our community…ICE sent a detainer requesting the Sheriff’s Office hold Gonzalez for 48 hours past his scheduled release time. However, this detainer is not signed by a judge so the Sheriff’s Office cannot legally honor it. Multiple Federal court cases have determined these administrative detainers are unconstitutional. …Gonzalez has been in our jail approximately 8 times for minor misdemeanor offenses. We have notified ICE about his release in several of those arrests as they took place before our recent policy change. We will continue to notify ICE if it complies with law and our policy. But as I stated earlier, they can seek a warrant and we will hold him. ICE attacked the Sheriff’s Office in the midst of the largest natural disaster this county has ever experienced. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, many people have lost their homes and 23 people have died from this firestorm. ICE’s misleading statement stirs fear in some of our community members who are already exhausted and scared. Earlier in the month, the Got News web site published an unsubstantiated claim that senior law enforcement officials believed that Mexican drug cartels — seeking a strategic advantage over the nascent legal marijuana industry — were responsible for the wildfires, which had destroyed a significant portion of cannabis farmland. That deeply flawed article was seized upon by web sites such as Proud Patriots, which almost gleefully reported: President Donald Trump was absolutely right once again. His predictions seem to be true and the US people have one huge reason why should they join the legal battle against DRUGS in the USA and the providers of those drugs – the illegal immigrants and the narco cartels. This trend of blaming certain societal groups (in these examples, immigrants and Muslims) for disasters and tragedies — both natural and man-made — and seeking out evidence of their culpability, however spurious, is nothing new. Throughout Europe in the 14th Century, Jews were scapegoated and blamed for causing the Black Death. They faced widespread and intensified persecution and violence as a result. The televangelist Jerry Falwell blamed the 9/11 terrorist attacks on “the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians.” He later apologized.",1
"An anecdote about Donald Trump and his outsized U.S. flag and pole neatly encapsulated what so many people found either most appealing or most distasteful about the business magnate and 2016 Republican presidential candidate: to some he was the no-nonsense take-charge type who had the power and influence to thwart those who would insist on allowing the enforcement of petty rules or “political correctness” impede the progress of business and the course of “making America great again”; to others he was a wealthy blowhard who thought the rules didn’t apply to him and habitually bullied others into submission to feed his lust for self-aggrandizement and self-enrichment:  When Trump purchased and rebuilt Mar-A-Lago the Grand mansion and estate in Palm beach, Florida he got into a dispute with the city, who are well known for being strict on zoning regulations. Trump put up a 50 foot flag pole even though 30 foot is the maximum allowed. The city imposed a 1,000 dollar fine per day. While Trump and the city argued back and forth, finally when the fine had reached 120,000 dollars Trump proposed a solution. He would donate that amount to veterans organizations, would move the flag and pole to a different location in front of the mansion and would only use a 30 foot flag pole. The city agreed. So Trump brought in the company who does Golf course construction had them build a 20 foot high grassy hill and put a 30 foot flag pole on top of it. The basic facts are these: In 1985, Donald Trump paid $10 million for Mar-A-Lago, the name of the Marjorie Merriweather Post estate in Palm Beach, Florida. On 3 October 2006, Trump had an outsized American flag (variously described as being either 15×25 feet or 20×30 feet) installed on an 80-foot-high flagpole at Mar-a-Lago, in violation of local zoning regulations that established a maximum size of 4×6 feet for flags and a maximum height of 42 feet for flagpoles. Trump put up his regulation-violating flag and pole without obtaining either a building permit permit or a variance from local authorities, and the Palm Beach town council accordingly fined him $1,250 (or, in some accounts, $250) for every day the flag remained in place (apparently citing him only for the pole but not the flag itself). Trump in turn filed a $25 million lawsuit against Palm Beach, claiming that the town was selectively enforcing its rules (by not fining other properties that were flying flags in violation of town ordinances) and infringing his constitutional right to free speech. Six months later the two sides finally reached an agreement during “secret, court-ordered negotiations,” with the town agreeing to waive all fines against Trump for his code-busting flagpole and to “review its ordinances and codes dealing with flagpoles and flags during the next zoning season,” and Trump agreeing to drop his lawsuit, lower the height of his flagpole from 80 to 70 feet, obtain a permit for the pole and move it farther inland, and donate $100,000 “to charities dealing with Iraq War Veterans, [the] American Flag, or the local VA hospital.”    So, the anecdote reproduced above is true in its broad strokes, although all of the numbers it cites (dollar amounts and dimensions) are inaccurate, the issue was resolved via court-ordered mediation (not by Trump’s “proposing a solution”), and the money Trump agreed to donate to settle the matter went to organizations selected by both sides (although Trump had previously stated that if he won his 15×25 feet or $25 million lawsuit, the proceeds would go to military members returning from Iraq). However, the New York state attorney general later sued Trump for paying the fine through his nonprofit Donald J. Trump Foundation instead of from his personal finances:  The New York state attorney general sued U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and his foundation, saying he illegally used the nonprofit as a personal “checkbook” for his own benefit, including his 2016 presidential campaign. Another $100,000 went to another charity in 2007 to settle a legal dispute over a flagpole erected in violation of local ordinances at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club and sometime residence in Palm Beach, Florida. We also haven’t been able to verify whether Trump connived to maintain (or even exceed) the height of the original pole by installing a 10-foot-shorter pole on a 20-foot-high hill — pictures of the estate show the flagpole rising from a mound, but the height of the mound is difficult to estimate from photographs:  Trump’s lawsuit maintained that he couldn’t bring his flag and pole into compliance with regulations because  “A smaller flag and pole on Mar-A-Lago’s property would be lost given its massive size, look silly instead of make a statement, and most importantly would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump’s and the Club’s members’ patriotism.” In his statements to the news media at the time he typically framed the issue as being one of his standing up to anti-American, anti-flag, anti-patriotic forces, while acknowledging that he hadn’t even bothered applying for a permit first (because he didn’t think he’d get one) and stating that he didn’t believe rules should apply to the American flag (and therefore to him in this instance):  “Well, I put up an American flag on the front of the Mar-a-Lago Club, which is a great house, probably the greatest house in America that I turned into a private club very successfully in Palm Beach, Florida. And the flag is very proudly waving, and the town wants me to take it down. Because they say I put it up without a permit and, frankly, had I gone to the town for a permit they wouldn’t have given it to me, probably. But more importantly, I say that you don’t need a permit to put up the American flag. I don’t think they know what their beef is. I’m not sure they really understand what their beef is. They don’t talk about the flag. They only talk about the flagpole because they’re afraid politically to mention the word flag and the American flag and take it down. And I’ll say it’s probably one of the most popular things I’ve ever done because we’ve had hundreds and hundreds of letters and thousands of requests for everything supporting the flag. Everybody wants it. Everybody wants it up. But the town wants me to take down the American flag, and I told them I’m not doing that. This is probably the wealthiest town — it is the wealthiest town in America, in the United States, and frankly it’s a town that wants me to take down a flag and they shouldn’t be asking for that. So it’s been a very, very problematic situation. I’ll be responding to them very shortly. And you know, I’m a big — I’m a very patriotic guy. I’m very proud of the country, and I don’t want to take down the American flag. And I don’t believe you need permits to put up the American flag.”  Long-time Palm Beach Post correspondent Frank Cerabino opined that the Palm Beach flag brouhaha had little or nothing to do with patriotism, but rather was part of a pattern of Trump’s using lawsuits to bend local authorities to his will — dredging up excuses to sue them for exorbitant amounts of money, then offering to drop the suits in exchange for agreements that provide him with significant business advantages:  Oh, he knew what he was doing. Trump, after all, had been fighting with the town poohbahs from the very moment he’d crashed into the complacent, clubby world of Palm Beach to buy Mar-a-Lago, which turned out to be one of those great deals he couldn’t afford. Trump knew from experience that Palm Beach was a stickler for adherence to its ordinances. He had once paid a $5,000 fine to the town for replacing a section of dead hedges with replacements that weren’t quite tall enough. But Trump had bigger changes in mind than merely out-flagging his neighbors. He was plainly inviting a lawsuit. The town council took the bait, citing the oversized pole and flag as violations of the town code, and fining Trump $250 a day for every day they remained on the estate. Tucked into his patriotic posturing was a completely unrelated legal matter that he made part of his multi-million lawsuit: a complaint about the town code that requires large commercial enterprises to be “town serving.” The town requires proof from local businesses that at least 50 percent of their business comes from town residents. So, for example, when Neiman Marcus opened on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, it was allowed to do so by promising that it would only advertise in the town’s newspaper, and not in publications that circulated to shoppers who don’t live on the island. For Trump, eliminating the “town serving” requirement would mean that he could offer more memberships to his Mar-a-Lago social club to people who had no connection to Palm Beach, making it easier for him to keep his club full. Softening up the town on the flag issue to pursue some other angle was a classic Trump move. Though he has yet to get this particular exemption waived, Palm Beach has learned from experience that Trump’s lawsuits are never settled, just dormant. One of his Palm Beach lawyers said recently that the “town serving” issue is still unresolved and ripe for more litigation. Trump [initially] couldn’t afford [to maintain] Mar-a-Lago as a single family home. His proposed solution was to chop his National Historic Landmark into something he called Mansions of Mar-a-Lago, a development that would put a public road through the middle of the estate, which would lead to the 10 mini-mansions he would build on the property, including one on the front lawn. The Palm Beach Town Council shot down all of Trump’s proposed changes to the property, even when he reduced his mini-mansion plans from 10 to seven. Instead, they encouraged him to find a buyer if he couldn’t afford to keep the estate intact. When the town’s government refused to bend to his demands, Trump sued. The lawsuit against the Town of Palm Beach, which would prove to be not his last, would eventually cause his neighbors to lawyer up against him. After his Mansions of Mar-a-Lago plan was rejected, Trump found another way to salvage his stake in Mar-a-Lago. He offered to drop his lawsuit if council members allowed him to convert his estate into a new private club on the island. The Mar-a-Lago Club. While Trump was playing defense against the town’s constant attempt to rein him in, he went on the attack against the county and its airport. Airlines routinely used a flight path in and out of Palm Beach International Airport in nearby West Palm Beach that brought the planes directly over Mar-a-Lago. This didn’t sit well with Trump, who argued that the noise and fumes were ruining his investment, and that the decent thing for the county to do was to move the airport farther west. Trump had been arguing this for years, to no avail, while calling the airport director Bruce Pelly, among other things, a “moron” and “the worst airport director in the country.” It turned out to be a useful gripe for Trump, one that he could turn into a new business opportunity, because just south of the airport was 214 acres of vacant scrub land owned by Palm Beach County, land he wanted. So Trump sued the county for $75 million over the airport noise, then negotiated to drop that lawsuit in exchange for the county giving him a 75-year lease on the nearby property for $438,000 a year. That land became the Trump International Golf Club, a $40 million, 18-hole, Jim Fazio-designed course that imported nearly 2 million cubic yards of dirt to transform the flat scrub land into hilly terrain with waterfalls, rock formations, and a clubhouse four stories above sea level. This wasn’t the only instance of flagpole bickering in Trump’s past. He also reached a (non-court) settlement with local government in 2014 after having raised Old Glory on a 70-foot flagpole at the Trump National Golf Course in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, without obtaining a permit first:   Signaling a possible resolution to Donald Trump’s running flag feud, the California Coastal Commission said the mogul’s oversized Old Glory can stay — as long as Rancho Palos Verdes revises its municipal height rules. While not the victory city officials had hoped for, the decision allows for a way forward to legally allow the 70-foot-tall flagpole, which was hoisted without a permit nearly 10 years ago. Having gained the support of much of the coastal city — as well as two City Councils through the years — the flag now likely can get formal state approval provided the city amends its Local Coastal Program that currently limits structure heights to 26 feet. “I’m disappointed at the Trump Organization for putting up that flag without adhering to the rule of law,” said Coastal Commissioner Wendy Mitchell. Commission staff members had recommended that the flagpole be reduced in height to 26 feet and moved closer to the clubhouse on the 240-acre Trump National Golf Course property.",0
"One might think of the following image, which apparently captures a Ku Klux Klan member (presumably the victim of a trauma) being treated by an all-black emergency room staff, as the flipside of familiar accounts of blacks dying from treatable injuries during the Jim Crow era of segregation because they were refused treatment at “whites-only” hospitals. In this photograph, however, the black ER staff doesn’t turn the tables by refusing to treat a KKK member despite his membership in an organization dedicated to terrorizing them; instead, they diligently work at saving his life, the same as they would for any other patient:  Despite many viewers’ mistaking it for such, this photo was not a real historical image, nor was it a screen capture taken from an episode of the then-popular television hospital drama ER, (and the doctor shown in the center of the picture was not actor Eriq LaSalle, who portrayed surgeon Dr. Peter Benton in that TV series). The crease down the middle of the image gave it away as a picture scanned from a printed source, and indeed it was — this photograph was a staged one created for a series of advertisements in Large magazine’s “For people who think bigger than they are” ad campaign, which featured depictions of people acting nobly in the face of adverse circumstances:",1
"There is no mention in this short story about the potential costs of such a test, if it proved to be viable. Of course, it’s too early to say anything definitive about cost, and offering a specific number might mislead readers by implying that the test is anywhere near ready to be used. But we think the story could have offered some sense of the technology behind the test and whether it’s advanced/expensive or cheap/widely available. Other tests using saliva are in use today and could offer a general comparison point to suggest the costs of a new test. While the story outlines the potential benefits of such a test in general terms, it does not quantify the results of the study or tell readers how accurate the test was found to be. We think any story about diagnostic testing or screening should discuss the sensitivity and specificity of the test — numbers which tell us about how well the test finds people who actually have the disease and rules out people who don’t have it. Direct harms from a simple saliva test seem improbable at best, given its non-invasive nature. But the competing HealthDay story pointed out that even a saliva test could produce false positives that could cause real anxiety in patients, something that clearly could harm them. There is also the potential for false negative results, which would falsely reassure patients about their status. Even an accurate positive finding could cause harm, since it would inform people about their risk of a future condition without giving them the ability to do much about it. This story focuses on the findings of a very early study using a small number of participants. But the shortness of this offering — four paragraphs — isn’t sufficient to convey the preliminary nature of the research. A competing HealthDay story offers a lengthy paragraph outlining all the factors that might explain differences in the saliva makeup of the three groups and thereby negate the test’s use for determining Alzheimer’s. That story also emphasizes the tentative nature of the work numerous times. In cases like this, where the research is preliminary and the reporting is cursory, it’s worth questioning whether doing a story at all is worth it. The story doesn’t engage in disease mongering, but there’s really not enough context about the disease or its impact to justify a Satisfactory rating. We’ll call it Not Applicable. The story doesn’t offer independent sources and only paraphrases information from the graduate student/principal investigator. This story focuses solely on research suggesting that a simple saliva test might one day gauge the risk of developing the disease. It doesn’t discuss how Alzheimer’s is currently diagnosed or what risk factors might increase one’s likelihood of developing the disease. We give credit here for this acknowledgment: “The results aren’t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s.” However, readers overall may get the impression that the test’s clinical usage is coming soon, when that’s not likely the case. We’d be much more comfortable if the story included more information accurately portraying the tentative nature of the findings, findings that might be actually caused by other factors not studied. The research discussed here is novel in a general sense, but the story doesn’t establish this to a satisfactory degree. A number of previous studies have looked at saliva markers of Alzheimer’s, and there are probably dozens of other blood tests, scans, and other approaches currently in development to address the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The story does not allude to this research. We didn’t see evidence that the story relied on this news release about the presentation. However, since it contains such limited information, it’s hard to determine how it was produced. We’ll rule it Not Applicable.",1
"Although the story does report that this special treadmill costs $25,000, that information is not very helpful to readers who aren’t likely to be shopping to buy a unit. The story should have reported the typical cost of a therapy session and a typical number of sessions that patients require; as well as whether the cost of using this device is generally covered by health care insurance plans. The story quotes one user calling the device “miraculous.” A trainer says the device “lets people walk with a normal gait so they don’t develop bad habits that lead to other orthopedic problems,” but without offering any evidence that users of the device far any better than those who rely on other rehabilitation techniques. The thrust of the story is that this weight-supporting treadmill speeds recovery, but nowhere does the story actually say what special benefit users get from this device. How much faster do they recover compared to alternatives? Do they walk or run better than if they had used a different device or technique? Readers are fed glowing, but anecdotal, praise for the device, while these and other important questions are left unanswered. The story does not address potential harms, including the potential harm of diverting patients from rehabilitation programs that have a more extensive base of supporting evidence and experience. The premise of the story is that this weight-supporting treadmill helps people recover from injuries, surgery and other walking and running problems. Although the story reports that “it’s rooted in science,” the research touted by the company does not actually address the question of whether this device works any better than (or even as well as) alternative rehabilitation techniques. A few anecdotal reports are offered, but no trials comparing this device to exercising in a swimming pool or using other methods to reduce weight load or impact during recovery. The company includes a long list of clinical reports on its web site, but almost all of them merely measure the biomechanical forces on users, not whether the device offers any advantages in terms of healing or function. While people quoted in the story said they felt better during the sessions, there is nothing to indicate they derived lasting health benefits. Also, some of the summaries of the research offered by the device maker appear to overstate the results. For example, the company describes review articles that “validate the AlterG as a highly effective rehabilitative modality in a wide variety of clinical settings,” but the review article cited just includes a picture of the AlterG treadmill as one example of available rehabilitation devices. Swimming pool exercise is the first option highlighted in this article, which does not refer to the AlterG device in the text.

Cartilage 1(2): 96-107, 2010. http://car.sagepub.com/content/1/2/96.abstract  The story fails to tell readers about ties between the people quoted in the story and the company that sells the device. For example, trainer Valerie Gluth has coordinated her physical therapy company’s marketing with Alter-G. Elite distance runner Shannon Rowbury appears in Alter-G marketing materials and has received free use of the device.

The story notes that this weight-supporting treadmill is available at a limited number of rehabilitation and physical therapy centers. But the story did allow one true believer to end the piece saying, “I think they’re going to be everywhere…” There is nothing new about partial weight support during rehabilitation. This story fails to put this particular treadmill device in context with other methods of reducing weight load and impact, such as treadmills that use harnesses or other methods to carry some of a person’s weight. Not applicable, for the following reasons. There is no independent source, so it’s plausible that the story was spoonfed by a news release. But since we don’t have any direct evidence of a news release influencing the story, we can’t rule it unsatisfactory.",1
"Almost 40 percent of children aged 10 and 11 in London are overweight or obese, according to research compiled for Britain’s parliament. “Child obesity in London is a ticking timebomb and I am determined to act. If we don’t take bold steps against it we are not doing right by our young people as well as placing a huge strain on our already pressurized health service,” Kahn said in a statement. The ban will target food retailers with products deemed high in fat, salt or sugar such as McDonald’s. McDonald's here has long been fighting perceptions that it encourages children to eat unhealthily. In 2011, it won a U.S. lawsuit allowing it to continue including toys in Happy Meals. Coca Cola and Pepsi here - as part of the American Beverage Association - faced scrutiny during the same year following a U.S. campaign to bring awareness to the potential health concerns associated with sugar sweetened drinks. Food and drink advertising contributed around 20 million pounds ($27 million) to Transport for London’s revenue during the 2016-17 financial year. A spokesperson from the mayor’s office said :”About two thirds of this comes from high fat, salt and sugar, food and drink.”  The National Centre for Social Research and Cancer Research UK found advertising of unhealthy foods – particularly when aimed at children – creates extra pressure on children and families when it comes to choosing what to eat and drink. “I want to reduce the influence and pressure that can be put on children and families to make unhealthy choices,” Kahn said. “I’m determined to do all I can to tackle this issue with the powers I have and help Londoners make healthy food choices for themselves and their children.”  The plans are a key part of the mayor’s draft London Food Strategy and echo initiatives that have been introduced in Amsterdam this year. Khan said: “The government needs to step up and join this fight against child obesity.”",0
"There was no mention of costs which can be signficant. The story reported on what the company media briefing wanted to report:  less pain, stiffness, disability and decreased use of pain medications in the braced group. But the story didn’t say if there was a control group and how results compared. There was no discussion of potential harms that might be associated with the use of the devices reported on. Are there any short term or potentially longer term implications resulting from the use of a knee brace? First, it’s not best practice to use a company-hosted media briefing on a device the company makes as the sole source of information. Second, this was a small study. The resuls might not be generalizable to typical individuals with knee osteoarthritis. Perhaps most importantly, there was no information about the study design and whether there was a control group to which the participants were compared No overt disease mongering of knee arthritis. The story included quotes from three clinicians and one patient – of which at least three appeared at the media briefing. There was no disclosure of any financial conflicts of interest among the three clinicians. Maybe there was none, but given the setting – a company-hosted media briefing – this issue should have been discussed. The story mentioned knee replacement in the body of the piece and listed non-surgical approaches to the management of knee osteoarthritis at the end. But there was no meaningful comparison of outcomes. There was no discussion of how widespread is the use/availability of knee braces in general or of the studied knee brace specifically. The braces studied were appropriately not portrayed as a new treatment approach. Reporting from a company-hosted media briefing isn’t much different than relying solely on a news release.",1
"India is likely to impose a nationwide ban on plastic bags, cups, small bottles, straws and some types of sachets next month as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to reduce use of pollution-causing, single-use plastic. But the plans have stoked fears among consumer firms, which, use plastic in packaging for everything from sodas and biscuits to ketchup and shampoo. “This has created an existential issue for multiple sectors,” said the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a lobby group, in a two-page draft note, seen by Reuters, which is likely to be finalised and sent to the government in the coming days. The CII will ask the government to consult industry executives and define what will be categorized as single-use plastics, while also pitching for some exemptions, according to the note. It says small-sized plastic bottles used for pharmaceutical or health products should be exempted as there is no alternate available. Sachets made from so-called multi-layered packaging should also not be banned, as that could disrupt supplies of key products such as biscuits, salt and milk, the CII draft says. A senior Indian government official said several industry representations were being reviewed, but the aim was to “get rid of the menace of plastic pollution” without causing disruption. In an Independence Day speech on Aug. 15, Modi urged people and government agencies to “take the first big step” on Oct. 2 towards freeing India of single-use plastic. India lacks a system for management of plastic waste, but environmentalists have hailed Modi’s move, saying it will help combat plastic waste that chokes rivers and drains. A ban on certain plastics from Oct. 2, however, will come just weeks ahead of big Hindu festivals for which business plans are laid out far in advance because they typically see a sharp rise in consumer purchases. Two industry sources said Amazon.com Inc, which uses plastics in its packaging, has been concerned that a possible ban could disrupt its operations ahead of festivities, and during its mega annual discount sale that starts Sept. 29. In recent weeks, executives from Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo and consumer goods seller Hindustan Unilever have been part of industry delegations that met government officials to express concerns and discuss alternate packaging solutions, according to a person with direct knowledge. Coca-Cola said in a statement that all its primary packaging does not consist of single-use plastic. Pepsi said its target was to make 100 percent of its packaging recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable by 2025. Hindustan Unilever did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon did not respond, but has previously said that it plans to replace single-use plastic in its packaging by June 2020. “The ban has ramifications for all sectors like food processing, dairy, garments, toys,” said Jayesh Rambhia of All India Plastic Manufacturers Association, which has 22,000 companies as members. “People, and companies, are pulling their hair today.”",0
"""Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and more than two dozen health professionals launched a statewide campaign last week to help Georgia smokers kick the habit. The """"Nobody Quits Like Georgia"""" campaign emphasized connecting smokers with the counseling and other support they need to quit successfully. """"Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking,"""" Reed’s office said in a press release on Nov. 17. The health hazards of cigarette smoking have been publicly recognized at least since the mid1960s, so could almost one in five Georgia adults still be lighting up? PolitiFact decided to check. First, a little background. Health advocates have been pushing to reduce the national smoking rate among adults 18 and over to 12 percent by 2020. About 20.6 percent of American adults were smoking in 2009, but the percentage has dropped every year since. In 2013, 19 percent of adults, nationally, and 18.8 percent in Georgia, were smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The CDC says smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body. More than 16 million Americans are estimated to be living with a smoking-related disease. These include cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the CDC. The financial toll of smoking is tremendous -- more than $300 billion a year in the United States alone. This includes about $170 billion in direct medical care for adults and more than $156 billion in lost productivity due to premature death and exposure to secondhand smoke, the federal agency estimates. So what about the city’s statement about the habit in Georgia? We started our fact-check by contacting Reed press secretary Jenna Garland. She told us the American Lung Association, lead sponsor of the campaign, provided the statistic that appeared in the press release. Searches of CDC statistics last week also verified that 18.8 percent of Georgia adults were identified as smokers in 2013, Garland said. """"At the time of our press conference and release, this data was absolutely correct. And it is still the primary data presented by the CDC,"""" she said. Garland is right -- for 2013. The picture is peachier for Georgia, however, based on newer data for 2014. That was available in a press release put out by the Georgia Department of Public Health on the same day that Reed’s office issued its statement. In 2014, Georgia’s adult smoking rate had fallen to 17.4 percent, down 1.4 percentage points from 2013 as measured on the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System.(BRFSS). Particularly significant, the rate of smoking fell to 16.4 percent in young adults, ages 18 to 24, state officials said. National data from BRFSS for 2014 has not made public. We examined data gathered in the last 10 years on smoking rates in Georgia and the nation. You’ll see that smoking rates have been heading downward both in the state and nation throughout most, but not all of the decade. This is based on data collected by states through the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and submitted by the CDC. Percentage of Adults 18 and over who smoke Year Georgia U.S. 2005 22.1 20.8 2006 19.9 20.5 2007 19.4 20 2008 19.5 19.7 2009 17.7 18.3 2010 17.6 17.9 2011 21.2 21.2 2012 20.4 19.6 2013 18.8 19 2014 17.4 Not available Source: Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) reports and Georgia Department of Public Health. --------------------- CDC spokeswoman Brittany Behm said that although the prevalence of smoking in Georgia has steadily declined in the past several years, the progress has not been as robust as it could have been. She said that’s largely because """"interventions we know work have not been fully implemented."""" She said these include higher tobacco product prices, comprehensive smoke-free laws, hard-hitting mass media campaigns, and full and sustained funding for comprehensive tobacco control programs. """"Statistically, Georgia ranks 24th among the states and DC—almost exactly at the median,"""" Behm said. Jean O’Connor, director of chronic disease prevention for the Georgia Department of Public Health, said state officials believe they’ve made serious headway, particularly with the tobacco-free schools program that’s now in 105 of the state’s 181 school districts. Enabling 1.3 million students to spend their school day free from exposure to tobacco appears to be showing up in the numbers, O’Connor said. With the smoking rate falling to 16.4 percent in the 18-24 age group, """"that tells us kids are aging up and not using tobacco products,"""" she said. """"If you can get to 25 without using, odds of being addicted are very very low."""" That’s reinforced in Georgia’s University System, one of the first in the nation to be smoke-free at its college and universities, O’Connor said. Our ruling A press release from Mayor Kasim Reed’s Office said: """"Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking."""" The first part of the statement is misleading. Smoking rates have generally been falling nationally and in Georgia. The state’s rate was lower than the national rate in 2013. Reed’s office is correct that, in 2013, 18.8 percent of Georgia adults over 18 were smoking. But newer figures paint a peachier picture for the state. It doesn’t change the mayor’s overarching point that the state still has a way to go. We rate Reed’s statement .""",0
"Although researchers have not reached a consensus about the optimal dose or formulation, the story could have provided cost information for the various over-the-counter zinc products. In addition, this story could have been enhanced by a brief discussion of the general costs of treatment and the cost of lost work days, school absenteeism, and physician visits. The story indicates that when zinc is taken within the first 24 hours of developing cold symptoms, it cuts the duration of a cold by an average of 1 day. No data from the review were provided regarding other outcomes, such as severity of symptoms, reduced absences from school, and reduced antibiotic use. Also, the story should have noted that a preventive effect was found after 5 months of zinc use and people who experienced a therapeutic benefit took zinc for at least 5 days during their cold. The story pointed out that nasal zinc products, associated with loss of smell, were not evaluated in the Cochrane review and it quotes one of the authors of the study suggesting that the potential harms of zinc products are limited to a bad taste and some nausea. However, the full listing includes constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dry mouth and oral irritation. While the story did a nice job of explaining some of the limitations of the studies included in the systematic review, particularly the issue of not adequately blinding participants to their assigned treatment, it failed to mention a few important points. For example, trial participants were between the age of 1 and 65 years and were in good health; therefore, the results may not apply to the elderly or those who have underlying illnesses. Also, the story is somewhat misleading in how the data was evaluated. While the review included 15 studies with a combined 1,360 participants, it would have been useful to note that 13 trials (966 participants) analyzed the therapeutic benefit for zinc, while 2 trials (394 participants) evaluated its preventive effect. Furthermore, not all the trial results could be pooled due to the nonstandarized approach to reporting outcomes. The story should have also noted that the authors had a good deal of confidence in the conclusions drawn about the duration of sickness and severity of symptoms, but they were far less confident in the other outcomes, such as prevention, fewer school absences, and less antibiotic use. The story places equal credence in the ability of zinc to influence all of these outcomes. The story did not engage in disease-mongering. And while we recognize that the majority of readers are familiar with the common cold, we would have liked to have seen some information on the estimated number of cases of the common cold, days out of work or other estimates to put the story into perspective. The story includes commentary from the review’s lead author, as well as Dr. Prasad, “an early pioneer of research into zinc as an essential mineral.” Two of Dr. Prasad’s many articles were included in the Cochrane Review. Quotes from an independent expert would have been welcomed. While the review only includes trials comparing zinc to a placebo, the story could have briefly discussed the efficacy of other types of over-the-counter cold remedies. Furthermore, we would have liked to have seen some comment on the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting a cold besides zinc products. A few words about hand hygiene and keeping your hands away from your eyes, mouth, and nose would have been helpful to readers. There is no question regarding the availability of products containing zinc; however, as the writer points out, the most effective formulation and dosage for reducing cold symptoms is currently unknown. Of note, the story specifically mentions that zinc lozenges from Coldcure.com were used in many of the trials evaluated in the Cochrane systematic review, but failed to note that they are no longer manufactured. The story makes it clear that the first trial evaluating the efficacy of zinc for treating symptoms of the common cold was published in 1984. This story does not appear to rely on a news release.",1
"On 24 March 2017, David “Avocado” Wolfe, prolific pseudoscience media mogul, purveyor of life-extending USB-chargeable “longevity zappers”, and self-described “wealthiest hippie on Earth”, published a post that went viral on Facebook titled “3 Reasons Why You Should Stop Eating Peanut Butter Cups!” This post, though essentially a word-for-word rip-off of a 2015 post from a website named “Living Traditionally,” is still somehow classic Wolfe: a highly shareable story crafted at the expense of a beloved childhood candy through the willful misrepresentation of the science surrounding its ingredients. In this case, Wolfe (or whoever wrote the article) points to three chemicals which, as a matter of fact, are present in Reese’s Peanut Butter cups: Soy Lecithin Research has shown that as much as 93% of soy is genetically modified. Soy lecithin has been found to have detrimental effects on fertility and reproduction. It can cause behavioral and cerebral abnormalities. It has also been linked to breast cancer. PGPR PGPR is short for polyglycerol polyricinoleate. The manufacturer of this popular candy replaced cocoa butter with PGPR to lower the cost of production. PGPR comes from castor beans and it’s used to reduce the viscosity of chocolate. It has been connected to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children. TBHQ TBHQ stands for tertiary butylhdroquinone. It’s derived from petroleum and can be extremely toxic. Side effects of ingesting TBHQ include nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, delirium and collapse. Research has shown that TBHQ can damage the lungs and umbilical cells in humans. It can also cause stomach cancer. Children who are exposed to this chemical may show anxiety, restlessness and intensified ADHD symptoms. Soy Lecithin Lecithin is a mixture of naturally organic compounds separated from their source by way of their shared chemical properties and added to a variety of foods to improve texture and aid in the mixing of ingredients. As defined by the United States Code of Federal Regulations: Commercial lecithin is a naturally occurring mixture of the phosphatides [derivatives of a specific chemical] of choline, ethanolamine, and inositol, with smaller amounts of other lipids. It is isolated as a gum following hydration of solvent-extracted soy, safflower, or corn oils. In terms of the soy-GMO link, this issue is somewhat moot because If GMO’s aren’t a person’s jam, then that individual probably wouldn’t be purchasing Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups anyway, as the Hershey’s Company discloses the possibility of GMO ingredients, broadly, in this line of products. The remaining claims are either misleading or factually impoverished. To support the notion that soy lecithin has “detrimental effects on fertility and reproduction”, causes “behavioral and cerebral abnormalities” and has been “linked to breast cancer”, the author of the post links to a different post by “Dr. Axe”, a naturopathic doctor, chiropractor, and nutritionist. In this post, Axe briefly mentions a largely irrelevant 1985 study that looked at the effects of feeding pregnant laboratory rats and their offspring with an absurdly high soy lecithin diet. In that study, rats were given 10 grams of standardized of food per day with either 2 percent or 5 percent of the mass of that food replaced by soy lecithin. This study, which had a narrow and specific aim of investigating a proposed mechanism behind a number of neurologic conditions, found that: The results indicate that dietary soy lecithin preparation enrichment during development leads to behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities in the exposed offspring. However, the amount of lecithin used in this experiment are multiple orders of magnitude more than any human could reasonably expect to be exposed to, even on a daily basis. Using the rough estimate 1800 grams of food consumed per day by the average human, a 5 percent lecithin diet would represent 90 grams of soy lecithin per day, which is roughly 1000 times more soy lecithin than the FDA estimates Americans get in their daily diet through additives (96 milligrams per day). Using an over 30 year old study of pregnant and developing rats fed absurdly unrealistic doses of a chemical to say that peanut butter cups are dangerous is a reach, even by Wolfe standards. By FDA “Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)” standards: There is no evidence in the available information on lecithin and lecithin bleached with hydrogen peroxide that demonstrates or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect a hazard to the public when they are used at levels that are now current or that might reasonably be expected in the future. The remaining claims regarding breast cancer, fertility, and reproduction are made by conflating soy protein and soy lecithin. Soy protein is chemically similarity to estrogen, a point that has been the subject of much scientific and internet debate about its potential adverse affects. While the mechanisms linking soy to any hormone-derived maladies have yet to be demonstrated, it is another moot point, as at most only trace amounts of soy protein, if any, remain in soy lecithin. PGPR Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), per Food and Industrial Bioproducts and Bioprocessing, is a common additive that is used: For improved texture and enhanced volume of bakery products, in salad dressings, and in chocolate to decrease the occurrence of fat bloom [a visual separation of fat from the rest of the chocolate]. While not hesitating to use its scary scientific name, the only allegation of note the Wolfe post makes is that PGPR has been “connected” to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children. Ignoring the fact that the same could be said about the ingredients in the natural version of peanut butter cups presented below Wolfe’s article, it is also a broad misrepresentation of PGPR’s risk, which is, at best, negligible. The most recent review of its safety, performed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and adopted on 3 March 2017, reaffirmed its safety: PGPR […] is not of concern with regard to genotoxicity or carcinogenicity. The single reproductive toxicity study with PGPR was limited and was not an appropriate study for deriving a health-based guidance value. Human studies with PGPR demonstrated that there is no indication of significant adverse effect. TBHQ TBHQ, used as an antioxidant preservative in many food items, is indeed a petroleum derivative (as are almost all carbon containing compounds not produced by living organisms), but that doesn’t mean it carries the same risks as ingesting raw petroleum sludge — it’s a specific, singular, isolated, and modified chemical. There have, in fact, been animal studies that report harmful effects after extremely large doses of TBHQ as well as other cases of extremely high or chronic exposure resulting in harm. As we wrote in a similar Wolfe debunker about the dangers of Pop Tarts, however, while the long-term health effects in humans exposed to high or chronic doses of TBQH (i.e. industrial or laboratory workers handing pure TBHQ occupationally) is not a settled issue, the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses legally allowed by USA and European regulatory agencies is settled. EFSA reevaluated its earlier (similar) conclusion regarding TBQH in 2004, finding that it is “not carcinogenic and that further genotoxicity studies are unnecessary.” The Wolfe post also claims that children exposed to TBHQ “may show anxiety, restlessness and intensified ADHD symptoms” despite the fact that no peer-reviewed studies link TBHQ specifically to ADHD, restlessness, or anxiety. This notion stems from the controversial ideas of Dr. Benjamin Feingold, who advocates the removal of myriad food additives, including TBHQ, as a cure for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and other behavioral issues. Despite his claims, however, no research specifically focused on TBHQ has documented any connection, and those diets he promotes generally treat a broad collection of additives as the same, despite clear chemical differences.",1
"On 11 February 2018, the Neon Nettle web site published a vivid article under the headline “Mom Catches Pedophile Trying to Rape Child, Blows His Head Off with Shotgun,” which opened as follows: A notorious pedophile has been found dead by police after a mother blew his head off with a shotgun when he tried to rape her 12-year-old child. The furious mom found convicted child sex offender Michael Lindsey in her daughter’s bedroom and took matters into her own hands. The woman from Blakely, Georgia, became suspicious and went into her young daughter’s room to find Lindsey attempting to rape her daughter after breaking into their home. In broad strokes, this report conformed to an incident reported by local news media in which a Georgia woman fatally shot a burglar who had concealed himself within a closet in her home: A Blakely woman shot a convicted sex offender to death after he allegedly broke into her home. During a 9-1-1 call the victim reported she was assaulted after discovering 53-year old Michael Lindsey hiding in a closet of her home. The woman’s 12-year old daughter was also present. “Deputies arrived at the scene and insured the safety of the victims who had locked themselves inside a room because they weren’t sure if the intruder was still inside the home,” Early County Investigator Captain Will Caudill said. Officers also discovered 53-year old Michael Lindsey outside the home. He was taken to a Blakely hospital and pronounced dead. He’s believed to have stumbled from inside before collapsing. Prior to the shooting she fought off her attacker with a spoon, a police report states. However, Neon Nettle is a notorious fake news blog with a predilection for publishing sensationalized (if not completely fabricated) stories about pedophiles, and true to form, Neon Nettle added multiple false elements to this particular report to enhance its luridness. For example, as we confirmed with Early County Investigator Captain Will Caudill, the woman referenced in this report did not “blow [the intruder’s] off with a shotgun.” The weapon she used was a handgun, and the intruder, Michael Lindsey, had “no gunshot wounds above the torso of his body.” Furthermore, the mother did not find Lindsey “trying to rape her 12-year-old child.” Lindsey had concealed himself in a closet of the home for reasons that remain indeterminate, as Captain Caudill told us that investigators “did not factually determine the motive for the burglary.” Finally, although Lindsey was a sex offender, he would likely not be described by any responsible news account as a “notorious pedophile,” given that he had but a single related conviction on his record, and that was from nearly twenty years earlier (1999).",1
"We wouldn’t expect a discussion of cost implications for a technique still in its formative years. But since the article states that “costs are reduced,” we have to address it. First of all, costs compared to what? Mammography? The other investigational techniques using RF or microwaves just mentioned? Let’s assume the comparator is mammography. It may be that, if and once there’s an available product, costs for each screening visit can be reduced. But the total costs depend on how effective it is. Without knowing how good it is at picking up breast cancer (sensitivity) and excluding signals that aren’t breast cancer (specificity), we don’t know its role. It might be too unreliable to replace mammography. Poor sensitivity leads to missing cancers, which cost life and money. Poor specificity leads to more unnecessary biopsies and treatments; if indeed people would screen themselves at home, poor specificity also means more unnecessary doctor visits. Also, will clinic and home uses be covered by insurance? As the independent sources says, we don’t know how the new device will be used. Until trials determine whether it will replace mammography, supplement it, or sink out of memory, we can’t know the total costs. To say vaguely that “costs are reduced” may not, therefore, be correct. They’re not quantified. Again, if it’s because the tool hasn’t been tested, we need to know that. No harms are discussed. If it’s too early to tell the rates of false positives, we need to know that. The article draws a picture of a tool with no potential downsides. The article does not evaluate the existence, no matter the quality, of evidence. If there is no clinical evidence yet, we need to know that. Omitting this discussion paints a picture of a tool that has the same level of proof supporting it as tools like mammography, which have been put through numerous rigorous trials and lived to tell the tale. The way the article puts it, there may have been research in patients, or there may just be a prototype on a workbench and non-clinical data. It’s not enough to say that a tool is novel, or faster, or provides real-time images, or can fit in a lunch box, or even (as the press release cheers) is a finalist for an engineering award. The tool may be promising, but only a sober evaluation of how well it works in human beings, checking its results, will tell us whether it will save more lives than we currently can or join the thousands of ideas that sounded good but didn’t pan out. The article alludes to prior research with RF and microwave technologies in detecting breast cancer. So what do we already know about this approach? Were the prior techniques effective but hampered by lack of speed and portability? While not a critique of the article, we’ll point out that, for this technique to be compared to mammography, it will likely need evidence that it improves survival. Part of the challenge in breast cancer screening is distinguishing between cancer and “pre-cancer” (or “cancer risk”). The word cancer actually refers to a large, strange zoo of different abnormalities. Some grow slower than others, some never causing problems within a patient’s lifetime. That means it can be hard to know the danger of an early finding from screening. Thus, in addition to knowing the benefits and harms, like the rate of false positives, we’ll need to see if this tool used on a schedule makes groups of people live longer. It may some counterintuitive, but the answer isn’t always a clear yes. This uncertainty was one of the embers in last year’s firestorm over the new mammography guidelines. The article cites statistics about mammography and breast cancer in younger women from the press release. They are within the range of key data in this field. (As an aside, the article says the stats are from the research team. We can’t say whether the writer of the press release actually compiled them.)",1
"This news release is about a pre-clinical study that looked at the effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles and curcumin in cell culture. It will be a while before this type of technology is studied in living patients. We rate this one Not Applicable. We caution news release writers that if it’s not too early to talk glowingly about the potential life-saving benefits of an intervention in a news release, it’s not too early to give some attention to the costs. However, this research is clearly far too preliminary to make such projections. The news release does not provide any data to support its claims. Instead, sweeping phrases are used to describe the benefits of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles: “This formulation included substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells.” Moreover, “nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect” in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, the news release states. No other benefit data are given. We like to see news releases giving a quantitative estimate of the potential benefit using numbers, instead of using broad, ambiguous terms like “substantial,” “minor” and “more pronounced.” Therefore, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. No harms are mentioned in the news release. Some scientists are concerned that nanotechnology may have toxic effects on the body, especially the lungs. Depending on the nanotechnology, other organs may also be at a risk for damage. In particular, some nanoparticles may affect the endocrine system, leading to changes in hormone levels, sexual characteristics, reproduction and development. The news release talks only about the benefits of nanoscience research without any description of its potential harms. Consequently, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating. We wish the news release emphasized the fact that this research was in its early pre-clinical stages. This means it will take at least another 10 to 12 years before this technology is tested in humans, if it even makes it that far. Testing treatments in cell culture is usually the first step along the research pipeline. If these experiments are successful, researchers then try the technology in living organisms — like mice, rats and rabbits. It’s important to remember that cells in culture behave very differently than cells in a living organism. And what works in animal models often is not effective when tested in humans, perhaps due to differences in genetics, environmental conditions and physiology. In a physician commentary entitled “The Failing Animal Research Paradigm for Human Disease,” it quotes a former National Cancer Institute director as saying, “We have cured mice of cancer for decades—and it simply didn’t work in humans.” In this study, researchers worked with cell lines containing “a high-risk form of neuroblastoma.” We don’t even know what type of cell lines they were. Were they derived from humans? Or mice? Although the news release talks about future research plans in animal models, we feel it could have been more explicit in pointing out its pre-clinical phase higher up in the report, like in the headline or first sentence. As a result, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no disease mongering in this news release. The news release discloses the study’s funding sources, which include the Nemours Foundation and the regional economic development initiative of the Florida High Tech Corridor. We were not able to find any potential conflicts of interests. We rate this one Satisfactory. The news release does not discuss any existing alternatives to treat neuroblastoma. Conventional therapy includes chemotherapy for those with advanced-stage neuroblastoma. Commonly used agents include cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and epipodophyllotoxins. For those with early-stage neuroblastoma, surgery is often an option. Some patients are also given adrenocortical hormone to treat their symptoms. We give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. The beginning of the news release makes it sound like this technology is available at your local hospital. Later in the report, however, the news release makes it clear that this study was conducted in cell lines in a laboratory. Researchers hope to expand this research to animal models and direct the curcumin nanoparticles to tumor sites, the news release adds. We feel this is enough for a Satisfactory rating. Although the news release makes it sound as if this research is completely novel, using curcumin-loaded nanoparticles to treat neuroblastoma is not exactly new. In fact, researchers from Nemours and UCF only confirmed (not found, as the news release claims) that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites. In 2012, an international team of researchers looked at how curcumin-containing nanoparticles induced cell death in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Another study from 2012 looked at the toxicity of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles. Since none of this was mentioned in the news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release does not include include unjustifiable, sensational language.",1
"U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles found that a state does not have “the power to compel a health care provider to speak, in his or her own voice, the state’s ideological message in favor of carrying a pregnancy to term.”  The law “compels a health care provider to act as the state’s courier and to disseminate the state’s message discouraging abortion, in the provider’s own voice, in the middle of a medical procedure, and under circumstances where it would seem the message is the provider’s and not the state’s,” she added in her 42-page ruling. “This is not allowed under the First Amendment,” Eagles ruled. The U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, but lawmakers in more conservative states in recent years have enacted laws that seek to place restrictions on the procedure, especially on late-term abortions. The ultrasound requirement of the law had been blocked by Eagles a few months after it was passed due to concerns over what she described as the “non-medical message” doctors were required to deliver. The law required that an ultrasound image be presented and the sound of the fetal heartbeat be offered at least four hours before an abortion, though a woman is free to look away and ignore an explanation and medical description of what is on the screen. The decision was hailed as a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood Federation of America which filed a lawsuit challenging the Women’s Right to Know Act. “Today’s ruling protects the rights of women and their doctors from the ideological agenda of extremist lawmakers,” said Jennifer Rudinger, executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina. “This law represented an egregious government intrusion into individuals’ private medical decisions, and we are very pleased that it will not go into effect,” she said. Defenders of the law said it provided crucial information for women making a major and irrevocable decision. “North Carolina’s ultrasound requirement is no different than requiring speech for airlines and cigarette manufacturers for safety reasons,” said Barbara Holt, president of North Carolina Right to Life. “The required information must be given even if the person hearing, seeing or reading the information finds the information upsetting, unnecessary or repetitive.”  A Republican state legislator who advocated the law, House Majority Leader Paul Stam, was not immediately available to comment after normal business hours. North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue, a Democrat and the state’s first female governor, vetoed the measure in 2011 but the state Senate overrode the veto. In her veto message, Perdue called the legislation a “dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors.”  When the law went into effect in October 2011, North Carolina joined 25 other states that require pre-abortion counseling that goes beyond basic medical “informed consent,” according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit sexual health research organization. It also became the tenth state to include the additional requirement of an ultrasound, which has drawn legal challenges in several states. North Carolina has some of the country’s toughest requirements for clinics performing abortions, including a requirement doctors be present when abortions are performed. It also bans publicly funded health insurance programs from paying for most abortions, and authorizes state health officials to design rules for increased safety standards for abortion clinics. In North Carolina, 17 percent of pregnancies end in induced abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The case is Gretchen S. Stuart, M.D. et al v. Ralph C.

"Soaring temperatures have killed at least 57 people across Japan since late July, just a year before Tokyo hosts the 2020 Games, highlighting the possible health threat to athletes and fans that is one of the biggest challenges for Olympics planners. A 50-year-old construction worker who’d been laying cable outside Tokyo Big Sight, which is being renovated to serve as the media center for Tokyo 2020, was found unconscious on the ground on Thursday afternoon and taken to hospital, where his death was confirmed, Tokyo 2020 organizers said in a statement. “While at this stage the precise cause of his death remains unknown, local police confirmed it was not necessary to proceed with a criminal investigation,” organizers told Reuters in an email. Police quoted by national broadcaster NHK said conditions at the site suggested heatstroke may have been the cause, but police declined to confirm the report to Reuters. Temperatures in Tokyo hit 35.5 Celsius (96 Fahrenheit) on Thursday. Temperatures in Tokyo have clung above 31 degrees Celsius (88 Fahrenheit) since July 24, exactly a year before the Games are set to open, with the heat intensifying in August to average daily highs of 34.8 Celsius (94 Fahrenheit). At least 57 people died across Japan from the heat between July 29 to Aug. 4 and 18,347 were taken to hospital. Some 45 people have died in Tokyo alone since Aug. 1, NHK said, many of them elderly living on their own. Tokyo 2020 organizers said they are reiterated pleas to all those working on Games venues to take the right precautions. “Today we instructed all construction companies under contract to Tokyo 2020 to ensure they properly implement and manage all appropriate health and safety measures at their workplaces,” said Games bosses. “We will continue to ask them to ensure thorough safety in their operations to avoid any possible accidents.”  “At the construction sites, the contractors have set up rest rooms equipped with air-conditioning and provided water coolers, ice makers, salt candy and other items,” they added. “We will continue to instruct contractors to implement and manage all appropriate health and safety measures in order to prevent heatstroke at their workplaces.”  Tokyo Big Sight was operational on Friday for a comic book and anime convention, with thousands of fans braving the heat to queue and enter the venue. Many wore wet towels on their heads and carried electric fans as they queued uncovered. Reuters witnesses saw one person being escorted away in a wheelchair by medical personnel as they suffered in the heat. “The heat is much worse in comparison with previous years, so for example if a worker works for one hour, companies should implement mandatory 10-minute breaks,” said comic book fan Takeyuki Sakano. “People tend to work too hard and push themselves over the edge, so having higher ups (managers) mandate these breaks as rules is necessary.”  Most Olympics have been held during the northern hemisphere summer. However, when Tokyo hosted the Games previously, in 1964, they were shifted to October to avoid the heat. The Mexico 1968 Olympics were also held later. Such shifts are no longer possible, though, due to international broadcasting and sports schedules, including the U.S. American football season and European soccer. Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 were held in summer despite the climate of both cities. Olympics organizers plan to take steps to deal with the heat, including shaded rest areas, tents at security checkpoints, mist sprays and ice packs. The start times for the men’s and women’s marathons, on Aug. 9 and 2 respectively, have been moved to 6:00 a.m. as an additional precaution. Tokyo is hosting the Olympics for the second time, with the Games running from July 24 to Aug. 9.",0
"Their study, published online in the American Journal of Public Health, is the first to look at suicide trends by age and business cycles, and it found that working Americans — people aged 25 to 64 — are significantly more prone to suicide in tough economic times. Researchers looked at the impact of business cycles on U.S. suicide rates from 1928 through 2007. They found a general correlation among suicide rates and major shifts in the U.S. economy. For example, suicides famously spiked during the Great Depression, surging to a record high of 22 suicides per 100,000 people in 1932, up from 18 per 100,000 in 1928. But other slowdowns also saw an increase in suicides, including the end of the New Deal (1937-1938), the Oil Crisis (1973-1975), and the Double-Dip Recession (1980-1982.) And suicide rates tended to fall during periods of plenty, such as during World War Two and the decade-long expansion from 1991 to 2001, in which the economy flourished and there were low rates of unemployment. “Knowing suicides increased during economic recessions and fell during expansions underscores the need for additional suicide prevention measures when the economy weakens,” James Mercy, acting director of CDC’s Injury Center’s Division of Violence Prevention, said in a statement. “It is an important finding for policy makers and those working to prevent suicide.”",0
"The revival of the sitcom Roseanne in March 2018 sparked big ratings for ABC, generally positive reviews, and, of course, controversy. However, the initial episodes did not seem to drive the conversation online quite as much as a years-old series of images that suddenly reappeared featuring the show’s eponymous star, actor and comedian Roseanne Barr, dressed up as Hitler and pulling gingerbread cookies out of an oven:  These photographs are real. However, they are frequently shared without important accompanying context. The series of images were originally part of a 2009 article in a “Germany” issue of Heeb magazine, a satirical Jewish publication that ran between 2001 and 2010. (An infrequently updated version of the magazine still exists online.) In the article which originally accompanied these photographs, entitled “That Oven Feelin’,” author Oliver Noble wrote that Roseanne asked to dress up as Hitler for the spread, as she believes (or at least jokingly said that she believes) that she may be the reincarnation of the Führer himself: As I wait for Barr to arrive, I contemplate the pop culture folklore that surrounds her: the alleged multiple personality disorder, the roller coaster relationship with Tom Arnold—which culminated in a bitter divorce—the theory (her own) that she may in fact be the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, whom she has requested to be dressed as for her Heeb photo shoot. “Nervous” doesn’t begin to describe my feelings about meeting this 5’4” Jewish grandmother. With her hit sitcom off the air for more than a decade and the tabloid pages of her tumultuous life rotting in landfills, Barr currently spends her time working on a collection of essays on menopause, celebrity, pharmaceuticals and Jewish life in Mormon Utah (to be published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment) and disseminating her signature mix of insights and insults through her blog (Roseanneworld.com). She briefly kept an account with what she now calls “that shit heap” (Twitter) before deleting it, citing as her reason “the idiocy of people and how ill-informed they all seem.” Today, when she brusquely enters the photo studio, she seems none too happy about having been dragged from her self-imposed exile. […] As the “Domestic Goddess” dons the famous moustache, transforming into “Domestic Goddess Hitler,” I notice that she’s beginning to have fun. She nails the Fuehrer’s facial expressions with twisted glee, and as she takes the burnt gingerbread “Jew Cookies” out of the oven it occurs to me that Barr may be the last celebrity utterly incapable of giving a fuck—a quality theoretically easy to embody until it’s time to face the practical repercussions. “Franklin Ajae, Paul Mooney, Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory’s passings will tear my kishkas out,” Barr laments. “They gave everything they had to just tell the truth, and they couldn’t make a decent living because of the choice they made—not selling out to Hollywood.” The photoshoot stirred up considerable controversy at the time, and from pundits across the political spectrum. Segments on The View and The O’Reilly Factor criticized the comedian for the Hitler-themed photoshoot. Heeb, however, defended the pictures and noted that Holocaust jokes are frequently featured in Hollywood movies, explaining that as a satirical, Jewish publication its goal was to challenge preconceptions: Heeb is a satirical Jewish culture magazine that interrogates stereotypes and ideas (hopefully in creative ways) that many hold sacred in order to represent the complex and nuanced perspectives that many Jews have about their identities. When we depicted Sarah Silverman behind a hole in a sheet or Jonah Hill dressed as Moses holding two kegs as if they were tablets, we weren’t trying to be shocking–we were trying to communicate something truthful about contemporary Jewishness. Yes, that may sound impossibly high-fallutin, but it’s the truth and while we kind of don’t give a shit whether the magazine wreaks havoc on smug and sanctimonious visions of Jewish life, we do care when our intentions (or those of our collaborators) are distorted. Virtually every pitch we received leading up to the publishing of our Germany Issue circled back to the Nazis and the Holocaust and almost all of them were humorous in nature. Naturally, our editors couldn’t help but wonder whether something new was happening in the culture— whether the taboo against joking about the Holocaust and the Nazis exerted as much power as it used to. Certainly Jews have been joking about the Holocaust since the Holocaust (I believe it was the Warsaw Ghetto where the Jewish inhabitants referred to Hitler regularly as “Horowitz”), but these jokes have largely been uttered in private or underground. In recent years, they have been finding themselves in the most public of conversations. […] And what better way to capture this moment in popular culture than by having the original “domestic goddess” don the Fuhrer’s famous mustache? For better or worse, hasn’t the Holocaust itself been domesticated? Roseanne also addressed the issue during an episode of The Green Room with Paul Provenza. The conversation about those Hitler images begins about the eight minutes in. We’ve transcribed the relevant portion below:  Roseanne: It’s like a Jewish woman. And She’s dressed up like Hitler. And he’s in drag. Hitler. And he’s baking cookies. And he’s really proud of them. But he’s also looking off into the horizon because he has a dream. It was for Heeb magazine. It was their Germany issue. And who better a symbol of Germany than Hitler? Provenza: What did your detractors have to say? Roseanne: Oh my god. You don’t want to piss of Jews. Even if you’re a Jew, don’t piss off Jews. All Jews hate each other. Provenza: Jews went crazy over this. Understandably. Rozeanne: I don’t think understandably. It really pissed me off. Because they were like “you’re making fun of the people in the ovens,” but I’m not making fun of people in the ovens. Patrice O’Neal: You kind of are though. The only thing worse would have been if you made the cookies skinny. Roseanne: There’s another, deeper layer to it. You know just the everyday. Moving off this Holocaust. There’s been about fifty of them since then. That’s what I’m kind of trying to say. Is like, Jesus Christ it’s so fucking every day now, holocausts, it’s like baking cookies. Provenza: Were you not aware that that’s not what people would be thinking?",0
"An early August 2019 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at Mississippi chicken plant made national news due to its size and the number of children left without parents or guardians in its wake; in its aftermath, rumors claimed that the business in question, Koch Foods, had been previously ordered to pay a large sum of money in a workplace lawsuit settlement.The screenshot above was shared to Facebook on August 8 2019, days after the raid. A status update read:“Ahhhhh ok, so the 600 immigrants arrested at work in Mississippi are the same folks who were awarded a huge settlement due to being physically and sexually assaulted while at work. They’re being locked up so that employers like Koch foods (owned by billionaire Republican Joe Glendys) can rely on the fear of raids to help them exploit migrant laborers already working in dangerous facilities without accountability for their other illicit labor conditions. Smh wowww”.The screenshot was originally shared to Instagram with the following commentary:So my good friend and attorney @hzaarour brought this to my attention just now, and I’m in utter disbelief—remember that chicken processing plant ICE raided and arrested 600+ workers? Well, that’s the same plant, and those are the same workers who were about to receive a large settlement stemming from an employment-related lawsuit.The posts include two claims: that ICE raided a Mississippi chicken plant called Koch Foods (no affiliation with or relation to the Koch brothers or Koch Industries) in August 2019, and that Koch Foods was ordered to pay nearly $4 million to its employees after they brought a suit alleging workplace abuses.On August 7 2019, ICE agents captured and detained 680 people in seven separate raids across six food processing plants in Mississippi:US immigration authorities have detained some 680 undocumented immigrants in what a federal prosecutor described as a record-setting operation.US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Mike Hurst told reporters the arrests took place at seven sites in six different cities in Mississippi on [August 7 2019]. The raids, he said, are “believed to be the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in our nation’s history.”Officials declined to provide details about what sites had been targeted, citing what they said was an ongoing criminal investigation. CNN affiliates reported the raids at food-processing plants throughout the state.Headlines indicated ICE detained “undocumented immigrants,” but how the immigration status of the hundreds of detained individuals was divined so quickly was not made clear in any reporting. A local news organization, the Clarion Ledger, reported that “Latino workers were gathered into one room” by ICE agents. At least 300 of the 680 detained were released within a day.According to another report, the seven raided plants were owned by a total of four companies:In some instances, immigrants were released from detention and outfitted with ankle monitors while awaiting deportation proceedings. Authorities tracking their GPS coordinates were able to see they were coming and going from Mississippi food processing plants.On [August 7 2019], hundreds of immigration officials descended on seven Mississippi plants owned by four companies — Peco Foods, Koch Foods, PH Food and Pearl River Foods. They are suspected of “willfully and unlawfully employing” undocumented workers, recently unsealed search warrants say.An August 8 2019 Chicago Tribune article identified one of the four companies as Mississippi-based Koch Foods:Mississippi ICE raids hit Koch Foods, a large suburban Chicago-based poultry processor that mostly flies under the radarThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids [August 7 2019] on agricultural plants in Mississippi hit close to home in Chicago, with about a quarter of the arrested workers employed by Koch Foods, a large Park Ridge-based poultry processor whose billionaire owner, Joseph Grendys, mostly flies under the radar.As many as 200 of the 680 people allegedly living in the country illegally, who were detained by authorities, worked at the Koch plant in Morton, Miss., according to an initial estimate by ICE spokesman Bryan Cox.The raids represent the largest workplace immigration sting operation of the Trump administration, with more than 600 agents from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations executing multiple federal criminal search warrants at seven Mississippi agricultural facilities.That article went on to report on a 2018 settlement agreement involving Koch Foods, as well as another immigration raid — this one in 2007 — at one of the company’s plants. Hundreds of those apprehended in August 2019 were employees of Koch Foods.A second claim held that Koch Foods agreed to pay a $3.7 million settlement in 2018, which stemmed from a discrimination lawsuit. The article seen in the screenshot was published by human resources industry site HR Dive on August 13 2018. It reported:Dive Brief:HR Dive linked to an August 2018 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) brief about Koch Foods and the settlement, which stated in part that Koch Foods was found to have engaged in retaliatory behavior against employees who reported workplace harassment and bias:Koch Foods Settles EEOC Harassment, National Origin And Race Bias Suit Poultry Supplier Pays $3.75 Million to Class of Hispanic WorkersBIRMINGHAM, Ala. – Koch Foods, one of the largest poultry suppliers in the world, will pay $3,750,000 and furnish other relief to settle a class employment discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today. The EEOC charged the company with sexual harassment, national origin and race discrimination as well as retaliation against a class of Hispanic workers at Koch’s Morton, Miss., chicken processing plant.According to the EEOC’s lawsuit, Koch subjected individual plaintiff/intervenors and classes of Hispanic employees and female employees to a hostile work environment and disparate treatment based on their race/national origin (Hispanic), sex (female), and further retaliated against those who engaged in protected activity.1 EEOC alleges that supervisors touched and/or made sexually suggestive comments to female Hispanic employees, hit Hispanic employees and charged many of them money for normal everyday work activities. Further, a class of Hispanic employees was subject to retaliation in the form of discharge and other adverse actions after complaining. […]The three-year consent decree entered today by Judge Daniel P. Jordan III provides for $3,750,000 in monetary relief for the victims. In addition, Koch Foods will take specified actions designed to prevent future discrimination, including implementing new policies and practices designed to prevent discrimination based on race, sex or national origin; providing anti-discrimination training to employees; creating a 24-hour hotline for reporting discrimination complaints in English and Spanish; and posting policies and anti-discrimination notices in its workplace in English and Spanish.Posts on social media claimed that many of the people ensnared in ICE raids in Mississippi were Koch Foods workers. Moreover, the rumors asserted that Hispanic employees of Koch Foods had been awarded $3.75 million in a 2018 settlement over workplace abuses. These claims are both true.Although other companies’ plants were raided by ICE that day, hundreds of the affected workers were employed by Koch Foods. It is also true that employees of Koch Foods sued the company over workplace abuses, and that the EEOC determined in their investigation at the time that some endured retaliation for their reporting of the abuses.",0
"The claim that British prime minister “Winston Churchill was born in a ladies’ room at a dance” has been circulating on Internet-based trivia lists for as long as we can remember. Given that Churchill was one of the most important figures of the 20th century — a long-lived statesman of international prominence whose career spanned two world wars and beyond — this would seem like a fairly easy item to verify, but once again things were deceptively  less simple than they appeared at first blush. To research this type of item (an anecdote about a famous figure), we generally first turn to the most recent biography of that person we can find, which in this case was Roy Jenkins’ 900-page Churchill: A Biography (2001). The brief description of Churchill’s birth found there mentioned nothing more remarkable than that he was born two months prematurely (labor having been brought on when his mother took a fall)  in a “singularly bleak-looking bedroom” at Blenheim Palace:  He was born on 30 November 1874 and, mainly by accident, in Blenheim Palace, although in a singularly bleak-looking bedroom. The accident arose out of his being two months premature. He should have been born in January in the small but fashionable house in Charles Street, Mayfair, which his father had rented to receive him, or more purposefully perhaps to use as a base for the somewhat rackety metropolitan life of which Lord Randolph and his bride of only seven and a half months’ standing were equally fond. This house not being ready, they had taken autumn refuge in Blenheim, and, as Lord Randolph put it in a letter to his mother-in-law in Paris, ‘[Lady Randolph] had a fall on Tuesday walking with the shooters, and a rather imprudent and rough drive in a pony carriage brought on the pains on Saturday night. We tried to stop them, but it was no use.’ Neither the London obstetrician nor his Oxford auxiliary could arrive in time, although it was over twenty-four hours to the birth from the onset of labor pains, and the baby was born very early on the Monday morning with the assistance only of the Woodstock country doctor. Well, maybe the author had to leave some things out in order to keep an already sprawling biography from spanning more than one volume, and the item we were looking for was one of them. So we tried other Churchill biographies, but they scarcely noted the circumstances of his birth at all, saving their detailed narratives for later portions of his life:   Winston Churchill was born in 1874, half way through the Victorian Era. That November, his mother, Lady Randolph Churchill, then less than seven months pregnant, had slipped and fallen while walking with a shooting party at Blenheim Palace. A few days later, while riding in a pony carriage over rough ground, labour began. She was rushed back to the Palace, where, in the early hours of November 30, he son was born. A volume entitled The Private Lives of Winston Churchill sounded promising, and there we found the suggestion that Churchill hadn’t been born prematurely at all and that the story about his mother’s taking a fall may have been concocted to cover a pre-marital dalliance:  The wedding took place in the British embassy in Paris on April 15, 1874, with all the signs of a somewhat hushed and rushed affair. There was none of the splendor that an international society wedding of such wealth and standing  would normally receive, no public ceremony, and little mention in the press. The Duke and Duchess [of Marlborough] were conspicuously absent. Was [the bride] already pregnant? Piety says no, but the evidence suggests she might have been. Why else the rush, the discreet ceremony, and the pointed absence of the Marlboroughs — followed by a notably uncomplicated birth seven months later, of the lusty baby who was christened Winston. At the time the premature birth was accounted for by Jennie’s falling while out shooting, followed by “a rather imprudent and rough drive in a pony carriage,” which apparently brought on the pains of labor. A small downstairs room at Blenheim was improvised for the confinement. It would have been in character for both participants not to have allowed mere chaperones or dull convention to impede passion — and it would certainly explain much of what happened later. Still nothing about a dance or a ladies’ room, though; only the unsatisfying notation that Winston’s birth was “notably uncomplicated.”   We pressed on. William Manchester’s The Last Lion also suggested Winston’s “premature” birth was a fiction promulgated to obscure a pre-wedding pregnancy, a ruse that supposedly fooled no one:  Another admission, which [the bride] preferred to keep from her husband’s family, was that she was bearing their grandchild. Indeed it is virtually certain that she had been pregnant for three months, and soon it would begin to show … Premature? The Times bought it. At the head of its birth notices it reported: “On the 30th Nov., at Blenheim Palace, the Lady Randolph Churchill, prematurely, of a son.” But no one believed it, not the patrician friends of the family, chuckling over the announcement, nor even the yeomen of Woodstock, who, the Oxford Times reported, rang “a merry peal on the church bells … in honour of the event.” Winston was full-term. It was generally believed that sometime the previous February, during the maddening negotiations over the marriage settlement, Jennie had eluded her mother, divested herself of the incredible layers of clothing then worn by young ladies, and received Randolph’s seed. Indeed, it was thought the duke and duchess had known Jennie was pregnant at the time of the wedding; that was why they had boycotted it. Sly allusions to the circumstances of his birth followed Winston all his life. He enjoyed them. He would reply: “Although present on the occasion, I have no clear recollection of the events leading up to it.” Of course, it is possible that his parents have been slandered. Periods of gestation do vary. He may have been premature. It would have been just like him. He never could wait his turn. But, more important for our purposes, Manchester also included an account of the birth itself, one which was clearly in the ballpark of what we were looking for:  That evening the annual St. Andrew’s Ball was held in the palace. To the astonishment of everyone, including her husband, [Jennie] appeared in a loose gown, holding a dance card. She was actually on the floor, pirouetting, when the pains started. Randolph wrote his mother-in-law [Clara]: “We tried to stop them, but it was no use.” It was, in fact, time to choose a birthplace. Her grandniece, Ann Leslie, afterward described Jennie’s search for one. Attended by servants and by Randolph’s aunt Clemetina, Lady Camden, she stumbled away from the party — which seems to have proceeded gaily without her — and lurched “past the endless suite of drawing-rooms, through the library, ‘the longest room in England,'” toward her bedroom. She didn’t make it. She fainted and was carried into a little room just off Blenheim’s great hall. Once it had belonged to the first duke’s chaplain; tonight it was the ladies’ cloakroom. Sprawing, she lay on velvet capes and feather boas, which were deftly drawn from beneath her when the ball ended and the merry guests departed. It was a long night, with servants hurrying in and out with poultices and towels. The pains, Randolph told Clara, “went on all Sunday.” He had telegraphed the London obstetrician Jennie had consulted, but, Sunday train schedules being what they were, the doctor couldn’t arrive until Monday. Thus, the historic role of delivering England’s greatest prime minister fell to Frederic Taylor, a Woodstock physician. “The country Dr. is … a clever man,” Randolph reported, “& the baby was safely born at 1:30 this morning after about 8 [sic] hrs labour. She suffered a good deal poor darling, but was v[er]y plucky & had no chloroform. The boy is wonderfully pretty so everybody says dark eyes and hair & v[er]y healthy considering its prematureness.”  That’s not quite enough for us to label this one as “true.”  Winston’s mother may have been attending a dance when she went into labor and delivered him in the palace where the dance was held, but he wasn’t actually born until more than 24 hours later, long after the dance had ended and all the guests had departed. And the room where the birth took place wasn’t a ladies’ bathroom at all but ordinary living quarters temporarily pressed into service as a place to store coats, as can be seen in photographs of Blenheim Palace. The confusion may stem from the fact that ‘cloakroom’ is sometimes employed as a euphemism for ‘lavatory’ in the UK, but in this case ‘cloakroom’ was clearly used in its literal sense.",1
"On 24 June 2016, a shocking story suddenly appeared out of nowhere: Queen Rania, Jordan’s beautiful consort to King Abdullah II bin al-Hussein, famous for her humanitarian work, was murdered by her husband in Rome. Why? Because of an affair she had, claimed the indifferently-punctuated article, with none other than the frontman to the band U2: According to many local observers the ominous news is considered widely as a harbinger of widening rifts within Jordan’s tormented social fabrics as the Arab nation of seven million is equally divided into native Jordanians and descendents of Palestinian refugees whom Queen Rania belonged.Unbeknownst to many Westerners, the King Abdullah of Jordan, a close ally of Obama administration, supports and harbors fanatic Saudi-backed ISIS terrorists and seeks to spread terrorism in the Middle-East region. While Queen Rania showed herself as a typical glamorous Queen, showing more agreeable and democratic façade to her husband’s despotic and repressive regime, but the rumors in Jordan whisper that there was a secret side to Rania’s life, that is least publicized. One thing facts could confirm though, Rania was living a life on the fast lane that is very much Hollywood, and Hollywood indeed, with all that come with that in stark contrast to restricted norms in her country. Dr. Oday al-Shana’a, a London-based former Jordanian court official and ex-friend believes that Bono, the famous Irish singer and so-called philanthropist seduced the innocent Queen. The story quickly spread through social media and aggregation sites, but there’s no truth to it. AWD News, the web site on which the story originated, doesn’t have more than a nodding acquaintance with facts, instead playing on nationalistic fantasy and conspiracy theory to create alarming (and thus clickable and shareable) stories. AWD News‘ story also included the following passage: “I am sorry to inform you that due to yet unexpected reasons, Her Majesty the Queen was found dead at her Excelsior Hotel room, 9:00 pm yesterday night . His Majesty expresses his sincere gratitude to the international  outpouring of grief and sorrow over the Queen ‘s death,” Moscow Times cited Mr. Tarawneh on Friday as saying, adding that before her death, the Queen did much to precipitate ending the long-troubled marriage by travelling to Rome to meet a family friend without King’s permission. No such quote was published in the Moscow Times, nor could we find it reproduced in any article that is not a copy of the AWD News story. Other extremely dubious headlines that have appeared on the site include the following: “European Union Unveils the Creation of ‘EU Army’ Hidden from British Voters Over the ‘Danger of Russia,'” “Saudi Arabia offers Mark Zuckerberg $250 billion to buy Facebook and arrest the pro-democracy activists, say reports,” and “Assassins Who Killed British MP Jo Cox and Targeted Donald Trump Tied to UK Military, CIA.” That last story alleges documents from the Kremlin’s Foreign Intelligence Service show that the man who murdered Jo Cox and a man who threatened Donald Trump could be traced back to the same mental hospital. (Needless to say, no such documents exist.) If Queen Rania had indeed been murdered by King Abdullah II in Rome, the news wouldn’t be leaked by a conspiracy-oriented web site out of Berlin. Also, if Queen Rania was indeed murdered on or before 24 June 2016, it’s news to her, as she’s still posting on social media: Happy birthday to Al Hussein! It has been a joy to watch you become the kind and dedicated man you are today. pic.twitter.com/l6S7eKGgfE",1
"In October 2016, a since-deleted petition hosted on the web site DailyPetition.com (of which there are no archives) alleged that the Michael Kors brand abused dogs and skinned them alive in the manufacture of their products: An undercover investigation carried out by animal rights group PETA has revealed the terrible truth of the dog leather industry in China. Currently, there is a strong mechanism in place to keep this disgusting industry in full swing mode. Needless to imagine, this involves a lot of suffering for man’s best friend. PETA has also managed to provide valuable insight about how this industry actually functions: stray dogs are captured from the streets by professional dog snatchers. They are sold to unlicensed facilities were their life is taken in the most abrupt way: they are hit over and oven with bladed objects (bats or sticks), before the actual skinning process starts. Some of the dogs are still alive when this happens. Their lifeless bodies are piled up and left in the facility’s dumpster for days. According to the investigator present on the scene, the sight and smell was absolutely terrible and difficult to endure. According to PETA, such facilities can process and deposit as many as 200 dogs each day. The compound visited by PETA housed 300 dogs. All them of them were kept in terrible conditions: deprived from their freedom, they were placed in tiny, dirty and dark cages, frightened and all alone. They were left without food and water for days. Most of them, constantly agitated, were climbing on each other in a desperate attempt to escape. But neither of them would see the light of day again. The floor of this facility would be later filled with tons of liters of blood. Innocent dog blood. All in the name of fashion. Please note that the images come from just one plant, but there are hundreds of similar facilities all across China. After the skinning is complete and the dog skin is properly processed, it is later sold to fashion companies such as Michael Kors, which transform them into trendy leather jackets or posh handbags, sold to unsuspecting customers at unreasonably high prices. The well known American designer has been long profiting off the backs of innocent dogs in China. However, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ (PETA) Twitter timeline lacked any content about products made from dog fur or Michael Kors, suggesting that the petition did not originate with that organization. A 25 October 2016 article published by an English-language version of a Chinese web site stated that the petition referenced a “DNA test” being needed to determine whether the animal products were indeed canine-derived, suggesting the claim had not been substantiated: U.S. animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) claim that their undercover investigation into China’s dog leather industry revealed how some facilities process as many as 200 dog carcasses every day, and then sell the processed dog skin to fashion companies such as Michael Kors to make leather jackets and handbags — items labeled as lamb skin. The report pointed out that most animal skin looks similar, and it’s almost impossible to determine what animal a given piece of leather comes from without a DNA test, according to a petition launched by animal rights activist Jerald Marrero on Oct. 20. The petition calls for a halt on the alleged dog skinning, and has received 17,908 signatures. It has been shared on Facebook and Twitter more than 26,000 times. “As one of the leading brands in the fashion industry, it is extremely important for Michael Kors to stand up against the Chinese leather trade and stop using this cruel fabric in its collections immediately,” the petition said. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticized Michael Kors in 2010 for using fur in general (but not dog fur specifically): Project Runway‘s eighth season premieres tonight, and coincidentally I just heard about an opportunity to let judge Michael Kors know what we think of his designs — which include real fur. Kors tweeted that he will be answering questions from his fans in a Facebook video on August 4. Let’s take him up on his offer and flood him with questions, such as “Did you know that animals are skinned alive for their fur?” and “With all the luxurious faux furs that are available, why do you continue to kill animals?” or maybe “Would you submit to a brain scan to see if your empathy neurons are underdeveloped?” PETA’s 2010 comment made no mention of dogs, however, simply asserting that (unspecified) animals used in the manufacture of some Michael Kors products were “skinned alive for their fur.”  The provenance of the petition hosted on DailyPetition.com is unknown, and a Whois search indicates that DailyPetition was created in July 2016 and that its ownership information is private: Michael Kors sent us the following short statement about the dog fur rumors: We wanted to let you know that these accusations are 100% false. Below please find an official company statement on the matter: – “Michael Kors leather products are not made of dog skin.

"""State prosecutors are scrambling to fend off fresh legal challenges to drunken-driving cases, with defense lawyers scoring some early victories under restrictive new evidence standards. The new rules -- which can make it harder to get police testimony and field sobriety tests admitted into court -- sprang from a legal-reform push in January 2011 by Gov. Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers. Republicans’ primary goal was to make it easier to block unreliable expert testimony and so-called junk science in negligence lawsuits against businesses. But the change applies to all types of civil and criminal actions, a move that led the state district attorney’s association to predict before passage that the new rules would """"significantly curtail our ability to prove our cases"""" -- including in charges of operating while intoxicated. That aspect of the law got a sharper characterization when the Democratic Party of Wisconsin -- gearing up for a recall drive against Walker -- blasted the governor on a host of issues. Amid complaints about the budget bill, concealed carry legislation and changes related to sex-ed in schools, the party in a news release declared that a Walker administration move makes it so that """"drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it."""" Amid the rhetoric is an interesting claim:  Does Act 2, the legal reform legislation, really mean an easier go for drunken drivers, either in criminal prosecutions or in personal injury suits against them? Asked to back up its claim, the Democrats cited three pieces of evidence: Mothers Against Drunk Drivers’ opposition to Act 2; the bill’s limits on court-ordered punitive damages in civil cases; and changes that make it harder for people to testify as experts. But Republicans decided to exempt drunken-driving crash victims from the punitive damage limits in civil cases. So that point is off the mark. The Mothers Against Drunk Drivers position is a moving target. The group opposed the bill initially, but then dropped its opposition after lawmakers added the punitive damage exemption -- and is now seeking a partial legislative fix in reaction to the new evidence rules. As for the evidence rules themselves, prosecutors say the issue is real and the change puts new pressures on them. We talked to numerous lawyers and researchers and they said the changes were significant, but welcome in concept. Almost all agreed the old standards allowed in too much. The new standards are used in federal courts, and by more than 30 states. Since the bill’s Feb. 1, 2011 start date, challenges to OWI evidence have played out in courtrooms and prosecutor’s offices under the new law. Both sides expect many more battles as the """"Daubert standard"""" rules (from a Supreme Court case, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.) come into play in more cases. In our interviews with lawyers in several counties, we did not discover any OWI homicide trials affected by the new Daubert standard -- the focus of the Democrats’ claim. But those cases would be subject to the same advantages and disadvantages as other OWI cases. And there are some examples we can dig into there: In the very early stages here, we found that a loose cadre of defense attorneys are sharing tips on how to mount challenges that DAs told us cause worrisome delays. """"This will protract cases in the long run,"""" said Gerol, who likes the Daubert standard overall. But what’s been the experience of prosecutors and defense lawyers in states that already have Daubert? Nationally, the reality doesn’t look one-sided, we found. Generally speaking prosecutors have found the new standards to be fairly neutral, just more work in defending the reliability of tests and witnesses, said Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association. On the defense side, national expert Michael Hawkins of Atlanta, said the tougher rules could produce an """"unintended benefit"""" for some defendants, but only when evidence doesn’t pass legal muster. """"It doesn’t make it ‘easier’ on drunk drivers,"""" said Hawkins, a National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers’ expert on drunken driving issues. """"It makes it so prosecutors have to do more work to assure judges and juries that the evidence they are using is accurate and reliable."""" Yes, prosecutors in Wisconsin are having a tougher go of it in first skirmishes here. But the rules apply to both sides. Defense attorneys acknowledge they will have have to introduce better and more reliable evidence under the new standards as well. In fact, Andrew Mishlove, a nationally certified OWI defense lawyer who is helping train judges and lawyers on the new standards, told us a half-dozen common defense strategies might wilt now under the tougher evidence rules. Among them: That testing equipment failed, or that radio frequency interference led to false readings of blood-alcohol level. Overall the new standard will """"prevent the defense from putting on bogus experts or questionable experts,"""" said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois-based OWI lawyer who is nationally recognized. Ramsell noted something pertinent to the Democrats’  claim about """"drivers who kill."""" He and others said both sides will have a tougher time presenting testimony on estimates of a person’s intoxication level at the time of an incident -- when the test wasn’t taken until hours after the arrest. In fatal-crash homicide cases, the prosecution will be hurt more often in that scenario, Ramsell said, because often the drunken driver is often injured too, preventing a timely blood test. Looking ahead, what can we expect? On the prosecution side, the big concern is that arresting officers were formerly treated as experts who could draw conclusions about sobriety tests -- but now are being challenged, along with the tests, and police training methods. In cases that already have some evidence weaknesses -- for example, the defendant refused breath and blood tests, or the tests were delayed -- these challenges can be important, lawyers on both sides said. Under the new system, judges are the gatekeepers of what is reliable and relevant scientific testimony, in contrast to past practice of letting juries hear almost everything. Some judges have concerns about testimony that has been routinely allowed in the past -- such as the follow-the-finger vision test known as Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN). Those test are not allowed as evidence in some states. """"There are judges that feel like (the vision test) is voodoo because of a conception they have,"""" said Emily Thompson, an assistant district attorney in Dane County who handles crash cases, including fatalities involving alcohol. Such concerns have led the Wisconsin chapter of MADD, the advocacy group, to call for the Legislature to revisit Act 2and exempt drunken-driving cases from the new evidence rules. """"This aspect is troubling and MADD hopes the Legislature remedies the oversight as we support prosecutors who often face a daunting task in making sure justice is served and criminal charges relating to drunk driving are fully prosecuted,"""" MADD spokesman Frank Harris told us. Ultimately the state’s high courts will decide how the issue plays out. But most experts and lawyers are predicting neither side will gain clear advantage; others say wait and see. Some prosecutors see some advantages long-term. There’s agreement that fairness will increase. Said Marquette University law professor Daniel Blinka when asked if OWI defendants would have an easier time: """"I don’t see how that’s going to happen."""" Our conclusion  The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that one of Walker’s actions was to make it """"so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it."""" One of their talking points to back up the statement -- related to civil lawsuits -- doesn’t hold up given amendments made to the bill. Their other issue, regarding Act 2’s tougher standard for scientific testimony, clearly does affect drunken driving prosecutions. And the law already has benefited some drunken drivers, though not in every instance where scientific evidence was challenged. (We did not find a homicide case affected, but they would be subject to similarly varied effects as would regular OWI cases.) So we think there’s an element of truth in the Dems’ statement. Some defendants already have found an easier road. But the statement implies the net effect of the law is tipped pro-defense. In OWI cases, that is an unknown at this point. Both sides -- defense and prosecution -- are subject to the new standards. And even defense-side experts don’t buy the """"easier road"""" argument. Finally, we think it’s misleading to suggest -- as the party’s statement did --  that the intent of the bill was to favor homicidal drunken drivers. It clearly wasn’t. We rate the party’s claim .""",1
"""When Sen. Tom Coburn said that under President Obama, """"all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government,"""" it was like a golden oldie PolitiFact has heard many times before. During the campaign, we heard the same tune from vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin  , who said Obama was calling for a """"government-run plan"""";  Mitt Romney  , who said Obama """"wants the government to take over health care""""; and  Rudy Giuliani  , who called Hillary Clinton's similar plan """"socialized medicine."""" (We rated their statements  Barely True  ,  Barely True  and    .) Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, made his remarks while criticizing Obama on a different matter. Obama is moving to rescind Bush administration rules that protected medical workers from performing procedures such as abortion that conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs. Coburn, who is against abortion, said rescinding the order would be only a first step for the Obama administration. """"Remember, under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government,"""" Coburn said in an interview on Fox News on March 4, 2009. """"So it's part of an incremental creep towards eliminating any objection, both as us as taxpayers and then individual physicians in terms of not complying with a government-run bureaucracy,"""" he added. Coburn and Obama can fairly disagree about conscience protections for health care workers who oppose abortions. But he's wrong that Obama's plan offers government-run health care. In fact, Obama's plan leaves in place the private health care system, but seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It also outlines strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as electronic medical records and preventive care. """"I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken,"""" Obama said at a health care conference he hosted on March 5. """"So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive."""" Would Obama's plan result in closer regulation of the health care system? Very likely so. It includes provisions that require health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and disclose more information about how they treat patients. Obama's plan also calls for evidence-based health care standards, so that government can stop paying (through programs like Medicare) for treatments that don't get good results. But the plan is very different from some European-style health systems where the government owns health clinics and employs doctors. We asked Coburn's office about his remarks. """"What matters is not just President Obama’s intent, or what his plan states, but the likely effect and consequences of his plan,"""" said spokesman John Hart. """"Under Obama’s approach, the only plans left standing will be those controlled by the government."""" That may be Sen. Coburn's opinion on what could happen, but it's definitely not part of Obama's plan. And Coburn was very specific in saying that """"under the Obama plan, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government."""" That gives the incorrect impression that Obama is promoting a government-run health care system. He's not. We rate Coburn's statement .""",1
"""The government shutdown has cranked up the volume on the blame game of who is causing the most misery for whom. The latest move comes from the right, where accusations began to fly that President Barack Obama was willing to put missing children’s lives at risk to score political points. From what we found, the claim started in the Twitterverse with tweets late on Friday night, Oct. 4, 2013. """"Did u see how the amber alert system was shut down & they even produced a screen to declare it!?"""" said one. Amber Alert is the system that draws the public into the hunt for an abducted child. The Right Scoop carried the message to a wider audience. At around 5 p.m. Sunday, it posted that the U.S. Justice Department Web page for the Amber Alert program was down. """"I’m sure you care about your lost child but Obama doesn’t – at least not while he’s trying to ‘win’ the government shutdown,"""" the blog post said. The Drudge Report put that item on its homepage with the headline, """"Amber Alert website shut down, Michelle’s ‘Let’s Move’ stays up."""" By the next morning, the Washington Examiner’s Mark Tapscott had an article titled, """"Obama shutters Amber Alerts as government shutdown enters second week."""" """"Somebody, somewhere in the Obama White House or the Obama Justice Department decided to shut down the Amber Alerts, despite the system's long and stellar record of helping locate missing children,"""" Tapscott wrote. Two congressmen, Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn, and Steve Stockman, R-Texas, added their own tweets into the mix, echoing the theme that Obama was playing politics with kids. By mid-morning Monday, the government Web page was back up, but chastising tweets continued. We decided to check out exactly what had been shut down, and by whom. Federal action If you went to the federal Amber Alert Web page on Sunday, you would have found this message """"Due to the lapse in Federal funding, this Office of Justice Program website is unavailable."""" That is what triggered the blog postings, tweets and articles. A Justice Department spokesperson explained to the Huffington Post, """"All the sites that had to go offline were put behind a firewall so that they couldn't be hacked while the IT people were on furlough."""" The spokesman said a furloughed worker was brought back Monday to put the site back online. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave the reason for that move at his press briefing later that day. """"To eliminate any confusion among the public about the status of the program. A furloughed Justice Department employee was called in to work in order to restore the informational site,"""" Carney said. """"But again, it’s informational. The system itself was never interrupted."""" We contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit that assists local and state authorities in this work. According to their data, over this weekend, at the same time the tweets and blog posts were building, the Amber Alert was activated twice: in Texas on Oct. 4 and in Florida on Oct. 5. At the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, spokesperson Gretl Plessinger said the news stories about the federal website had prompted some people to call out of concern. Plessinger reassured the public that Florida's program """"is operating as it always has."""" We also got in touch with Gene Thaxton of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, who coordinates the Amber Alert system for that state. Thaxton was emphatic that the program never closed. """"Oklahoma has its own Amber Alert program, and it is not affected by the government shutdown,"""" he said. """"The federal Web page is informational. It doesn’t affect the operations of the program."""" To be clear, the Amber Alert system is not run by Washington. States set up their own programs and use guidelines and standards that are shared nationwide. The program is a network of these state-run operations. At the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, spokesman Bob Hoever told us that the federal Web page plays no role in actually finding children. Hoever said local or state law enforcement officials trigger an Amber Alert when authorities have details like the name of the child, a photo of the child, the kind of car involved, a plate number, or a photo of the suspect. """"Those are the things that have led to a rescue in the past,"""" he said. State authorities then notify the media and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The center spreads the word through the Web and over cell phones, sending automatic text messages to everyone with a smart phone in the area where officials think the child might be. """"We had a case in Minnesota where a teenager read the text on her phone, and there across the street was the car,"""" Hoever said. """"She told her dad, and he called the police, and they rescued the child."""" Hoever said as far as he knows, from the initial investigation to the public reports of a possible sighting, the federal website has never been involved. """"If people knew how this worked, we wouldn’t be dealing with this confusion,"""" he said. Our ruling People on Twitter, bloggers and others said the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert system. Actually, each state has its own alert system, and national coordination takes place through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit, untouched by the federal stalemate. The system has continued to operate through the federal shutdown, sending out alerts in Texas and Florida. The one sliver of truth that triggered this claim is that a federal webpage promoting the program was closed, but that did not affect the program itself. It is a mistake to confuse that web page with the Amber Alert system.""",1
"The news release does not discuss the cost of this complex intervention or the cost of genetic testing for Alzheimer’s. The costs for adhering to this protocol would quickly add up, but the descriptions are so vague that it’s impossible to make informed projections. It cites “diet, brain stimulation, exercise, pharmaceuticals, optimization of sleep, specific pharmaceuticals and vitamins,and multiple additional steps that affect brain chemistry.” The research consists of 10 case studies in which all subjects showed some degree of improvement. But the news release gives information about only three patients — out of 10 in the study — who had the most dramatic improvements.It relates those patients’ self-reported advances in functionality and gives measurements in memory improvement for two patients. It does not warn that self-reported improvements are likely to be biased by the patient’s expectation of benefit from the program. It does not describe the specific interventions used for each patient. The news release doesn’t tell us the total number of patients that were enrolled in this protocol. Were only the 10 that showed improvement included in the case study? What about the rest? The release appears to cherry pick some data regarding risks and uses relative risks only, no absolute numbers. For example, you cannot tell from this release what your chances are of getting Alzheimer’s if you have one or two APOE genes. Claims found in the release such as “Follow up testing showed some of the patients going from abnormal to normal” are both grandiose and unsubstantiated, but they could raise patient and caregivers’ hopes that they or a loved one could reverse their Alzheimer’s symptoms. The news release does not mention any potential risks of any aspect of the protocol. Since we do not really know what the protocol consists of we have no way of assessing potential risk. Neither the news release nor the study explain how the patients were selected, or whether there were any drop-outs. It would be useful to know whether participants had a previously demonstrated ability to adhere to treatment protocols or family support that would help them stick to the intensive MEND regimen. The news release does not mention that at least one patient dropped out temporarily, raising a concern that the program, which is complex and requires many lifestyle changes, may be difficult for some patients to follow. The news release also doesn’t point out that it’s unknown how long observed improvements will be maintained. The program as a whole has yet to be proven effective and safe in a broad population. The news release acknowledges this fact with a quote from Bredesen: “Even though we see the far-reaching implications of this success, we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites.” It would be difficult to perform a rigorous clinical trial on this protocol since it’s reportedly tailored to each patient and involves 36 potential interventions. Clinical trials usually test only one treatment at a time, preferably comparing it to a placebo. The news release points out the vast and growing number of Alzheimer’s cases. But it edges toward disease-mongering when it quotes a researcher suggesting the protocol can “transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer’s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition.” It also recommends genetic testing for everyone, which clearly is not appropriate or warranted. The release states, “Now we’re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention.” The news release notes that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided some funding, but it does not list all of the study’s funding sources. Those include the Accelerate Fund, an early-stage investment fund based in Canada. The researcher also apparently stands to benefit from sales of a book set to be released in May 2017 through a mainstream book publisher. The news release gives the briefest nod to an alternative, stating that the protocol to reverse memory loss “follows the abject failure” of single-drug therapies for Alzheimer’s. In reality, many interventions, not only drugs, have been tried and none have been found to work. Some of the MEND interventions, such as dietary changes and exercise, may be readily available. But the intensiveness that this approach requires would make it hard for most people to access financially and logistically. Perhaps the book about the program, when it publishes, will make this clear, but the news release does not. The news release claims that the research “is the first to objectively show that memory loss in patients can be reversed, and improvement sustained” using the complex protocol. We rate this unsatisfactory since the release implies throughout that the protocol can reverse memory loss in Alzheimer’s patients when that is not indicated by the limited evidence. There are several instances of unjustifiable language in the news release, given the fact that this was an uncontrolled 10-person study. Some examples: “The magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented” “Transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer’s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition” “Now we’re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention.”",1
"This is one of those beliefs that is so widespread that a survey of             florists found that most of them believed it to be true. That’s             because it has been the conventional understanding about poinsettias             for many years. The consensus of government agencies, health centers, veterinary             groups, and plant and             flower organizations that we’ve surveyed, however, is that poinsettias are not             toxic and do not pose a health threat to children or pets. The belief in poinsettia poison appears to extend back to 1919 when             the two-year-old child of a U.S. Army officer died. It was             believed that the death was caused by the child ingesting poinsettia             leaves. The American Society of Florists has looked into the             matter extensively and says there was never any proof that             poinsettia leaves were responsible for the child’s death and the             report was later determined to be hearsay. The America Society of Florists joined with researchers at Ohio             State University to test various parts of the poinsettia plant on             rats. Their conclusion was that there was no toxicity or any             other side effects even when the rats were given large             doses. POISENDEX is the source of poison information for the majority of poison             control centers. It says that a 50-pound child would have to             eat more than a pound-and-a-quarter of poinsettia leaves to exceed             the doses used in the Ohio State research, which would be 500 to 600             leaves. The American Society of Florists says no other consumer plant has             been tested for toxicity more than the poinsettia. The ASPCA Animal Poison Center in Urbana, Illinois says it regards             poinsettias as having such low toxicity risk that it doesn’t even             recommend decontaminating animals that may have ingested them. The center says that there can sometimes be gastrointestinal             distress from having ingested something alien to the digestive             system. The American Veterinary             Medicine Association of America (AVMA), doesn’t include poinsettias             on its list of plants that are a threat to animals. Because of the belief that poinsettias are toxic, there are numerous             visits to hospitals each year by concerned parents or pet owners whose children             or pet have ingested or in some other way been exposed to             poinsettias. A study released in 2000 by Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and             Carnegie Mellon University found that out of nearly 23,000             poinsettia exposures reported to poison control centers nationwide,             there was essentially no toxicity of significance of any kind.

"""Taxpayers may have been shocked to learn from House Republicans that President Barack Obama wants to pay for health care by charging them to turn on a light. """"The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year,"""" the House Republican Conference said in a Web post and press release titled """"Questions on the Budget for President Obama,"""" distributed March 24. """"What effect will this have on Americans struggling to pay their mortgages?"""" it asked. This alleged """"light switch tax"""" is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, and allow companies to trade emissions credits among themselves. That's called a cap-and-trade program, and Republicans say the companies would just pass the tax on to electricity consumers. So any revenue raised by a cap-and-trade program amounts to a """"light switch tax"""" on consumers, the House Republicans alleged. To back up the claim, their staff pointed us to an  M.I.T. report  that says a similar a cap-and-trade proposal (the administration has not yet detailed their own version) would raise $366 billion per year. If you divide that by the 117 million households in the United States, you find it would cost each household $3,128, they said. But is it that simple? Can you just assume consumers would be out $366 billion since that's how much the program would raise from fuel companies? No. """"It's just wrong,"""" said John Reilly, an energy, environmental and agricultural economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the report. """"It's wrong in so many ways it's hard to begin."""" Not only is it wrong, but he told the House Republicans it was wrong when they asked him. """"Someone from the House Republicans had called me (March 20) and asked about this,"""" Reilly said. """"I had explained why the estimate they had was probably incorrect and what they should do to correct it, but I think this wrong number was already floating around by that time."""" It continues to float. That's just not how economists calculate the cost of a tax proposal, Reilly said. The tax might push the price of carbon-based fuels up a bit, but other results of a cap-and-trade program, such as increased conservation and more competition from other fuel sources, would put downward pressure on prices. Moreover, consumers would get some of the tax back from the government in some form. The report did include an estimate of the net cost to individuals, called the """"welfare"""" cost. It would be $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family if you use the same average household size the Republicans used of 2.56 people. The cost would grow over time as the program ramps up, but the average annual cost over time in today's dollars — that is, the """"average annual net present value cost"""" — is still just $85 per person, Reilly said. That would be $215.05 per household. A far cry from $3,128. And that isn't the only inaccuracy in the claim. The Republican press release said the cap-and-trade program would pay for """"nationalized health care."""" But Obama's  health care proposal  is not for """"nationalized health care."""" It does call for a """"National Health Insurance Exchange"""" with private insurance options plus a new public plan based on the one currently available to members of Congress — but consumers could still keep their private insurance if they want, as Obama emphasized during his presidential campaign. Even if it were true that Obama wants to nationalize health care, he does not envision paying for health care reform with the cap-and-trade program as the Republicans alleged. Rather, his $634 billion health care reserve fund is to come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers, according to Obama's proposed budget. The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their Web site and sending out an updated press release that says the cap-and-trade program would pay for """"increased spending"""" rather than health care. But it still calls cap-and-trade a """"light switch tax"""" and claims the whole cost would come from consumers. If the Republicans had simply misstated the results of the MIT study, the Truth-O-Meter would have been content giving this one a False. But for them to keep repeating the claim after the author of the study told them it was wrong means we have to set the meter ablaze. . Update, May 6, 2009 Two days after we published this item, Reilly sent a letter to Rep. John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House, complaining that his study """"has been misrepresented in recent press releases distributed by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The press release claims our report estimates an average cost per family of a carbon cap and trade program that would meet targets now being discussed in Congress to be over $3,000, but that is nearly 10 times the correct estimate, which is approximately $340."""" (The $340 is a cost per family of four, comparable to the $215 we used as the cost per household of 2.56 people.) Reilly said it was """"simplistic and misleading"""" to interpret the statistics the way the Republicans did because the administration's cap and trade proposal has """"been designed to offset the energy cost impacts on middle and lower income households."""" A day later Boehner responded with a statement that insisted $3,128 was accurate. """"In reality, it would be a tax of up to $3,100 per family on every American family that drives a car, buys products manufactured in the United States, or flips on a light switch,"""" Boehner said in the statement. On April 22, the conservative  Weekly Standard  came to the defense of the Republicans and published  an article  that said Reilly had erred in calculating the cost. It said that Reilly had since corrected the figure from the original $340 to $800. The article by John McCormack, an editorial assistant at the publication, said that even with the corrected figure, Reilly was """"still low-balling the cost of cap and trade by using some fuzzy logic. In reality, cap and trade could cost the average household more than $3,900 per year."""" The  Weekly Standard  noted that Obama plans to use some of the cap-and-trade revenues to fund his """"making work pay"""" tax credit of $400 per individual and $800 per family per year but then did not reflect that plan in the ultimate cost to households. It said there was no proof that Reilly is correct to assume that """"the $3,128 will be 'returned' to each household."""" The article also said that our PolitiFact item was incorrect because we relied on Reilly's numbers. Several PolitiFact readers who apparently believe that Reilly's corrected figure means the Republicans are now accurate, wrote to us and urged us to publish a correction. So we have revisited the numbers to provide this update. First, we should emphasize that our original item was simple and straightforward. The Republicans said their claim was based on the MIT study. But Reilly, the author of that study, said the Republicans were misrepresenting his work. And not only that, he said he'd told them they were misrepresenting his work  before  they made the claim, and they made the claim anyway. That struck us as an egregious falsehood. And it's important to recognize that our  rating was on the overall statement that, """"The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year."""" The first part of that statement about nationalized health care is completely false. The Obama administration is not proposing nationalized health care, a phrase we believe is meant to invoke fears of socialized medicine. Yet Republicans have repeatedly made that inaccurate claim. So that part of the claim was and remains ridiculously false. Now, in light of Reilly's revised number and Boehner's refusal to change what he says, let's reconsider the second part of the claim, that the Obama administration is proposing """"a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year."""" First, calling it a light switch tax remains incorrect. That implies that it is a federal tax levied on consumers when in fact it is an extrapolation of the per-family burden of a new federal charge that would be levied on energy companies. To say it """"would cost every American household $3,128 a year"""" suggests tremendous precision. But we have found virtually no precision about anything to do with the cap and trade proposals because they are still very much just in the talking stages. Indeed, the House Democratic version is known as the """"discussion draft"""" and, although there are some broad concepts, key details about how the program would work, its ultimate cost and how Americans would be reimbursed for higher energy costs are still far from final. But, given Reilly's corrected number, is it now accurate to say it will cost every household $3,128 a year? No, it's not. As we said in our original item, Reilly's analysis has produced two different ways to measure the cost of a cap and trade system. One way is the total estimate of federal revenues from a cap and trade auction, which indeed works out to $3,128 per family in the United States. That's the amount of money the energy companies would have to pay the federal government, and presumably the companies would pass those costs to consumers through higher prices. The issue then becomes whether or not the Obama administration intends to offset that cost to families. Republicans take the position, which was echoed by the  Weekly Standard,  that the Obama administration has no such plans. Reilly says the administration does. Who's right? Of course, we can't really know what the administration intends to do, but the available record makes it pretty clear that the White House has made plans to return to families the money the cap and trade program might cost them in energy bills. Some of it -- $400 per year for individuals, $800 for families -- would go directly back to families through the """"making work pay"""" tax credit totalling $65 billion per year, according to  the Obama budget proposal  . An additional $15 billion per year would benefit them indirectly through research and development on clean energy technologies. And the budget specifies that """"all additional net proceeds will be used to further compensate the public."""" That backs up Reilly's claim that the $3,128 is effectively returned to people. The second way to look at the cost of cap and trade is through the impact the proposal would have on the overall economy -- the extent to which the new system would constrain the economy and slow its growth. That's the source of Reilly's $340 number, which he has corrected to $800. That number is still far short of the very precise $3,128 the Republicans have been using. And Republican leaders continue to toss around the $3,100 number, often with no caveats or qualifiers -- or mention of the $800. We called Reilly to get his reaction to the article in the  Weekly Standard  and the Republicans' latest claim  . He said the  Weekly Standard  editorial assistant who wrote the story """"just completely twisted the whole thing."""" He said his correction to the $800 figure didn't substantially improve the accuracy of what the Republicans are contending. Their claim """"is a misrepresentation. They are basing (the $3,128) on our study and that is an incorrect use of our study. It's false."""" Here at PolitiFact, we're sure there will be plenty of other claims in the next few months that will allow us to further examine the cost of a cap and trade proposal. This claim has centered on Reilly's two-year-old study, but other studies have been done more recently and will soon be in the political mix. But for now, this claim remains a serious distortion in many ways. It is a ridiculous falsehood to say the money is being used """"for nationalized health care."""" It is inaccurate to call it a """"light switch tax."""" And it is incorrect to cite a precise """"tax"""" of $3,128 -- with no caveats or qualifiers -- when the Obama administration has specified how the money would be returned to people. Given Reilly's comments that they are using his numbers improperly, we see nothing to change our conclusion. So our original ruling stands: . - Bill Adair, PolitiFact Editor""",1
"""Even when condensed to two paragraphs, you can see the potential land mines Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, might face over his former hospital chain, Columbia/HCA.Paragraph 1. Scott grew Columbia/HCA into the nation's biggest hospital system. It then became the center of a multi-state federal investigation in 1997 that centered around whether Columbia/HCA defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned under pressure in 1997 as the scope of the investigation grew.Paragraph 2. Columbia/HCA eventually settled the fraud cases, paying a record-setting $1.7 billion in fines. The company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. Four people also were indicted; two were convicted, but those convictions were overturned on appeal. Scott himself was not indicted or questioned in the case.Largest fine ever. $1.7 billion. Resigned under pressure.A third-party group, the Alliance for America’s Future, has crafted a 30-second ad attacking Scott's record at Columbia/HCA. And there's a baiting Twitter account, ScottFraudFiles, being pushed by supporters of Bill McCollum, Scott's Republican primary rival.The attacks are being countered by Scott, who has deep pockets and already has spent millions of dollars on television advertisements.Scott launched a website, www.truthaboutrickscott.com, to refute claims about his time leading Columbia/HCA. He also is up with a new television ad called """"Truth,"""" where Scott challenges McCollum on the Columbia/HCA story. Looking directly into the camera, here's what Scott says: Bill McCollum’s been in politics for 30 years. You’d think he’d want to talk about his record. Instead he’s just attacking me. That’s what career politicians do.I’m going to do something the politicians never will, give you the unvarnished truth.The McCollum crowd says the hospital company I started was fined by the government for Medicare fraud.Unfortunately, that’s true.I wasn’t ever charged or even questioned by the authorities, but that’s not what matters. What matters is that the company made mistakes. And as CEO I take responsibility and I learned from it.Now here’s the part McCollum leaves out:Two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were our hospitals.Our hospitals earned the highest quality rating, 4 times the national average.We had the best care at the lowest prices for our patients.If you want a career politician, go with McCollum…But if you want someone who learns, leads, and demands accountability … I’m Rick Scott, let’s get to work. Since this is a Florida campaign, we decided to check Scott's claim that two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were owned by Columbia/HCA. (First, a note. We love seeing fact-check journalism and noticed that Michael Putney of WPLG in Miami dissected the Alliance for America’s Future ad and, to a lesser extent, Scott's rebuttal that we're analyzing here. We think you should check out his report. It starts about 35 seconds in. )Scott's campaign said the claim about Columbia/HCA's Florida hospitals comes from a December 1995 article in a health care trade publication, Modern Healthcare.The article references a 1994 study of America's hospital system. The study, performed by Health Care Investment Analysts and William Mercer, rates hospitals in terms of cost efficiency and patient outcomes -- measuring mortality rates, length of stays for patients, the number of employees needed to treat a patient, occupancy rates and financial performance.HCIA and and William Mercer then create a list of the nation's Top 100 hospitals. The list is subdivided by the type of hospital -- rural, urban, teaching hospital, etc. """"Of the 17 hospitals from Florida in the top 100, 12 are in one category: nonteaching hospitals of more than 250 beds. All are Columbia hospitals,"""" the Modern Healthcare article says.The article mentions that one of the 12 was purchased by Columbia/HCA after the study was performed, so really it's 11 out of 17. That's 65 percent, or right around what Scott mentioned in his ad.We checked subsequent years of the study and found similar results.In 1995, the same study rated 13 Florida hospitals among the Top 100. Nine of those hospitals were Columbia/HCA properties, or 69 percent.Twelve of 17 Top 100 Florida hospitals (70.5 percent) were run by Columbia/HCA in 1996, according to the same study.That's all right in line with what Scott said, but it fails to account for those big land mines we mentioned earlier.If the study measures financial performance, for instance, did Columbia/HCA hospitals rank artificially because it defrauded Medicare and Medicaid?We turned to one of the authors of the study, Jean Chenoweth, to find out. Chenoweth now works for Thomson Reuters, which continues to publish the annual hospital survey.We asked: Had you and the study group known about Columbia/HCA's Medicare fraud investigation -- would that have affected the rankings?She said: """"We can’t give a definitive answer to a hypothetical question. Our policy calls for us to rescind any 100 Top Hospital Award found to have been given on the basis of inaccurate data. Columbia/HCA settled its case, so we have no proof or admission that specific data that led to a specific hospital receiving a 100 Top Hospital Award was inaccurate. That makes this difficult to answer definitively. """"Chenoweth's answer muddies things a bit in our minds.Because the corporate fraud charges were settled, there never was a public airing of the specific allegations. And because there was never a public airing of the specific allegations -- and a finding of guilt -- the study authors were unable to see if the figures they measured were deemed fraudulent. It's also important to note that the study was focused on the outcomes of individual hospitals while the federal investigation centered around dozens of Columbia/HCA properties.Where does this leave us?In his ad """"Truth,"""" Scott certainly cites the Top 100 hospital report correctly when he says that two-thirds of the Florida hospitals to make the list were owned by Columbia/HCA. But he glosses over the fact that those rankings could at least be questioned because fraud-laden data may have been used in the analysis to make the rating.The author of the study doesn't know if the data was accurate or cooked, because the fraud case never went to trial.We found no evidence to say the rankings are bogus, but we think the claim could use a little additional information. To us, that correlates to a rating of .""",0
"Bill and Melinda Gates’ polio vaccination efforts in India have not paralyzed 47,500 children. The eRumor surfaced in 2013 when the website Nsnbc International published a  report that claimed Bill and Melinda Gates hired Bollywood actors to encourage Indians to take an oral polo vaccine in a campaign that went horribly wrong: “Polio is a terrible disease that kills many and paralyzes others. Fifty years ago it was widespread around the world. When you talk to people who remember polio in the United States, they’ll tell you about the fear and panic during an outbreak and describe grim hospital wards full of children in iron lungs that maintained their breathing. At its peak in the United States in 1952, polio paralyzed or killed more than 24,000 people. “But in 2011 alone, the Bill and Melinda Gates’ polio vaccine campaign in India caused 47,500 cases of paralysis and death.” The report goes on to claim that the CDC had “dropped the oral polio vaccine from its vaccine schedule in the U.S. because it was causing polio,” which is true. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) has not been used in the U.S. since 2000. The CDC  said the risk of paralysis, which effects one out of every 2.4 million children, was too high: “To eliminate the risk of VAPP, as of January 1, 2000, OPV was no longer recommended for routine immunization in the United States. However, OPV continues to be used in the countries where polio is endemic or the risk of importation and transmission is high. OPV is recommended for global polio eradication activities in polio-endemic countries due to its advantages over IPV in providing intestinal immunity and providing secondary spread of the vaccine to unprotected contacts.” The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  said that it contributes technical and financial recourses to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) to support things like targeted vaccination campaigns, community mobilization and stronger routine immunization efforts: “A cornerstone of the GPEI polio eradication strategy is the goal of reaching all children in the first year of life in the highest-risk countries with multiple doses of OPV, through both national and local vaccination campaigns. Efforts include door-to-door immunization in areas where poliovirus is known or suspected to be circulating, as well as in areas at risk of re-importation, with limited access to healthcare, high population density and mobility, poor sanitation, and low routine immunization coverage… “OPV, the polio vaccine used in most of the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But OPV consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases — 1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine — can cause paralysis. In settings with very low OPV coverage, OPV vaccine viruses can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population, just like wild polioviruses.” But the eRumor’s central claim — that Bill and Melinda Gates’ polio efforts caused “47,500 cases of paralysis death” — is false. It’s based on an  editorial in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics. The editorial said 47,500 new cases of non-polio AFP reported in India in 2011 was “directly proportional” to doses of OPV administered there. The statistic was used to argue the larger point that donor funded “disease-specific” projects should be dropped in favor of community-oriented primary health care programs. But research doesn’t support the editorial’s claims. Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science and the World Health Organization launched a  study on the rise of AFP cases in India, and found that a number of factors contributed to it. First, the definition of AFP had been broadened so that weakness and paralysis that result from non-polio viruses now fall under the AFP definition, which led to many more cases being reported. A second factor is that with polio nearly eradicated in India, screenings for non-polio viruses that cause AFP have spiked dramatically, which means that more cases have been identified. According to the study: “This large increase in non-polio AFP cases, which represent AFP cases caused by agents other than poliovirus, probably reflects the excellent implementation of the expanded definition of AFP and highly sensitive surveillance and detection methods used by NPSP in India from 2005 onwards, in contrast to the other polio-endemic countries, i.e., Pakistan, Nigeria, and Afghanistan, where the expanded AFP surveillance is not in place. The large increase in the non-polio AFP rate from 1.45 and 1.97 per 100,000 children during 1998–2003 to 16.20 in 2011 further reflects the excellent operational performance of the expanded AFP surveillance in India.”  Comments",1
"The death toll from AES, a fever that affects the central nervous system, has risen from 97 reported last Monday and medical and government officials are facing mounting criticism for struggling to contain the crisis in the town of nearly 350,000 people. AES, known as ‘brain fever’ is caused by any one of a number of viruses. Symptoms include high fever, vomiting and, in severe cases, seizures, paralysis and coma. Infants and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. “I received my last update in the afternoon and according to the latest report that I have, 129 children have died so far,” Shailesh Prasad Singh, the top state medical official in Muzaffarpur told Reuters by phone. The town lies about 80 km (50 miles) from Patna, the state capital. The precise causes of AES are not known, though a majority of medical professionals say it is linked to a ferocious heat-wave. Some studies have blamed toxins in lychees, a fruit grown in abundance in orchards around Muzaffarpur. But many families told Reuters last week that their children had not eaten them in recent weeks. Singh said a team of experts, including doctors, paramedics and other government officials were working “round the clock” to contain the spread of AES, which killed more than 350 children in a previous outbreak in Bihar in 2014. Doctors from other parts of the country had been dispatched to Muzaffarpur to help staff at the Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital which had to evict a group of sick inmates from a ward to accommodate the surge in AES patients. Most of the children who died were being treated at the hospital. Nearly half of all children in Muzaffarpur are underweight, and a similar number are stunted, making them vulnerable to AES, which grips the town almost every year when summer temperatures surge. As the death toll mounts, both the Bihar and the federal governments have come under criticism for their inability to save children, and doctors and government officials have faced angry protests. On Sunday, the Bihar government suspended a doctor in Muzaffarpur for dereliction of duties, news agency ANI, a Reuters affiliate, said. India’s Federal Health and Family Welfare Minister Harsh Vardhan, who is himself a doctor, said last week that health officials have finalised plans for construction of a 100-bed pediatric intensive care unit in Muzaffarpur, but gave no timeframe for when it would be built.",0
"According to a 29 December 2017 story in the New York Times, Silicon Valley is going all-in on “off-the-grid” water — marketed as an untainted, healthier alternative to bottled or tap water. There’s a growing movement to drink what some people are calling “raw water,” and some companies are capitalizing by selling untreated spring water at a considerable markup at health food stores on the West Coast. Raw water proponents either buy this water or find their own natural spring water for drinking. The health risks inherent to either form of untreated water — cholera, E. coli, hepatitis, and giardia, just to name a few — have been well covered. Without sterilization procedures, there is no guarantee the water does not contain pathogens, either from the water source or introduced during the collection and bottling process. But what about the argument that, despite these health risks, there is some inherent benefit to drinking unpurified water? When intelligible, the rationalizations boil down (not literally, of course) to a collection of health aphorisms with no demonstrable relationship to untreated spring water. As a case study, we will focus on the raw water purveyor Live Water, whose arguments echo those of similar companies. Live Water, a company that has undergone a variety of name changes since its founding as “Fountain of Truth Spring Water” in 2015, is run by a man who changed his own name to Mukhande Singh from Christopher Sanborn after getting into the raw water business. According to Singh, the primary benefit imparted by his water, which he told the Times “stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,” is beneficial bacteria that would have otherwise been removed during the sterilization process. His company’s web site reads: Living spring water is the key to unlocking a perfect micro-biome balance. The probiotics listed [in this analysis of our water] are exclusive to our unsterilized water. […] They are imperative for optimal physical and mental health. Without these probiotics we’re not able to fully assimilate all the nutrients in our food. Some beneficial bacteria are also ​proven​ to have abilities to transform harmful bacteria. Here is a published medical report supporting evidence that raw spring water has vast healing abilities. The density of scientific errors contained in this statement is considerable. Below, we will pick apart the primary misrepresentations contained within, along with the report that Singh links to: The “Perfect Micro-biome Balance” Singh first alludes to established and well-accepted science on the myriad links between gut microbiome and overall human health, falsely suggesting that because his water contains bacteria (apparently any old bacteria), it too will impart benefits. In fact, there are very specific criteria for what makes a bacterial strain viable as a dietary probiotic. Aside from not causing harm to a human, legitimate probiotics have to be able to survive the environmental conditions of the stomach and to consume material present in the stomach, among many other requirements. Even within commonly used probiotic strains like Lactobacillus, the number of species within that single classification which can actually work as a probiotic is low. A 2008 study isolated 567 lactobacilli strains from healthy human fecal samples and screened them for their probiotic potential. Only 36 of those nearly 600 strains made the cut. In other words, without knowing what bacteria specifically are present in a “raw water” sample, claims of its probiotic nature are baseless. The Bacteria in Raw Water “Are Imperative for Optimal Physical and Mental Health” Laudably, Singh provides the results of chemical and biological safety testing performed on his water, which includes a readout of the viable strains of bacteria cultured from a sample. Unfortunately, the strains identified (hailed as “recently discovered probiotics”) are are by no means exclusive to his product nor are they “imperative for optimal physical and mental health.”  The bacterial flora of Live Water belong to two somewhat obscure but closely related genera: Pseudomonas and Acidovorax. Found in soil, they are not known to impart any human health benefits, and are not listed in any studies as potential candidates for human probiotics. One major reason is that they do not consume the carbohydrates that might be found in the human intestinal tract. Instead, they consume dangerous organics such as solvents and dyes. Pseudomonas oleovorans, the most common bacterial strain in Live Water, is known primarily for its ability to degrade the triarylmethane dye malachite green. Pseudomonas putida, also found in Live Water, can be helpful as an environmental tool because it can break down the harmful solvent toluene. There is no evidence to support the claim that these play a role in “assimilating nutrients,” because — among many other reasons — toluene and triarylmethane are not nutrients. Given that most viable probiotics are harvested from human sources and not from pristine aquifers, it is unlikely that other springs used as raw water sources would provide useful probiotics. Some Bacteria “Are Also ​Proven​ to Have Abilities to Transform Harmful Bacteria” Singh alleges that certain “beneficial bacteria” can “transform harmful bacteria” into something benign. As evidence, he links to the Wikipedia page for “Phage therapy” which uses viruses called bacteriophages (not “beneficial bacteria”) to kill harmful bacteria. While some work suggests a potential role for some specific bacteriophages to affect some specific infectious bacteria, its inclusion on the Live Water website is an absolute non-sequitur because Singh provides no evidence that any bacteriophage is in his product. Bottom line: It’s not 100% clear what Singh is talking about here, but he appears to have confused bacteria with bacteriophage — an unforced error, given the wholescale irrelevance of phage therapy to his raw spring water. “A Published Medical Report Proving Raw Spring Water Has Vast Healing Abilities” Finally, Singh links to a single scientific study as evidence to support his claim that raw water has “vast healing abilities.” The linked study speculated that a single mineral spring’s ability to heal skin wounds (topically, not by drinking it) might possibly be aided by the bacteria present. (None of the bacteria in that spring was identified in Live Water). In other words, the one (preliminary) scientific study Singh actually cites is about the healing properties of soaking in a specific spring in Italy, not about drinking spring water. It is, like many other statements made on Live Water’s website, irrelevant to the issue at hand.",1
"E-cigarettes and vaping have been the focus of a number of social media rumors. In early 2018, one such rumor appeared that using a JUUL brand e-cigarette had caused lung cancer in four students: Vaping and juuling CAN cause cancer. Talk to kids. Did I mention we should talk to kids?https://t.co/dFIpTwVNeW pic.twitter.com/99MkGL0p83 — Deborah Gilboa, MD (@AskDocG) March 5, 2018  honestly I didn’t even know juuling was a thing until it stopped being a thing bc all these kids have lung cancer now yikes :/ — mckenna 🌈✨🦄 (@swiftlydinah) February 14, 2018  Although plenty of news reports warned parents that JUULing was the newest dangerous teen trend, we have been unable to find any that reported diagnoses or death from cancer associated with use of e-cigarettes. This rumor appeared to originate with viral screenshots from an Instagram post of indeterminate origin: the juul wave is ~over~ pic.twitter.com/FcP4pMqNNw — matea cannavino (@mateacannavino) February 7, 2018  According to the screenshots, four students in total have received terminal or otherwise dire diagnoses attributed specifically to their use of JUUL products. Aside from the mention of two universities (USC and LSU), the only available detail was that a 19-year-old man purportedly was “diagnosed with lung cancer” and his “lungs [were] completely black.” This rumor comes with no supporting evidence, incidental or otherwise. Dr. Kien Vuu, professor of medicine at UCLA-David Geffen School of Medicine, addressed the plausibility of specific claims that at least four people had developed lung cancer by JUULing for a relatively short period of their lives: It is unlikely that ‘Juuling’ has a short term carcinogenic effect which would cause cancer so early in these young people. It usually takes a lag time from an exposure of a carcinogen before cancer ensues. Research into the long-term effects of e-cigarette use is ongoing, but David Levy, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi, said of data published in mid-2017: Our findings are consistent with randomized trials and those observational studies that measure frequency of e-cigarette use. These results support the use of e-cigarettes — especially, consistent use — as an effective smoking cessation aid. Since e-cigarettes are generally estimated to have a small proportion of the mortality risks of cigarettes, this represents an important life-saving intervention that doctors can recommend when other forms of treatment fail. Levy referenced a study (“E-cigarette use and associated changes in population smoking cessation: evidence from US current population surveys”) published by BMJ on 26 July 2017. Laws about minimum age for tobacco purchases vary between states. However, JUUL’s self-imposed age restriction is 21, regardless of any state laws: Beginning August 23, 2017, the minimum age to purchase JUUL products on JUULvapor.com will be 21 years or older. For some existing customers, this may mean changes to your account or delivery experience. Warranties will continue to be honored for JUUL devices purchased at retail or online for customers who are of legal age in their state. JUUL posted a statement addressing the rumor: The claim circulating on social media that individuals’ friends “have been diagnosed with cancer as a direct result of the JUUL” is unsubstantiated and reckless. For all our customers, partners and employees that are on our important mission with us to improve public health, know that we will protect the company and our customers and take legal action as appropriate. At JUUL Labs, we care deeply about our customers. Many people in the company and their friends use JUUL as well, so we include ourselves as our customers. We are a mission driven company seeking to eliminate cigarettes by providing a true alternative for adult smokers. JUUL incorporates important technological advances and best practices which include the following; First, JUUL is temperature regulated to minimize the emissions of combustion-related degradation products. Second, we do not add chemicals of concern on key FDA lists such as formaldehyde as ingredients. (Note that nicotine, while on these lists, is included in our product to facilitate switching for adult smokers.) Third, independent third party laboratories have conducted validated analytical tests on the aerosol contents of JUUL and we are excited to present these results within the SRNT scientific forum at the end of this month.",1
"The article does not mention, even generally, what removing a clot using these devices might cost. In a broader way, we would have welcomed discussion of how much treating strokes costs the entire health system and how risks versus benefits of different strategies may have large effects throughout the health system. For example, if this new intervention prevents disability for more patients, might it save the system those costs? This story is not about a single research study, so it is perhaps understandable that it remains general in its comments about benefits. But we found only statement from an expert that addresses the issue: “All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots.” While stopping a stroke is clearly a benefit, that sentence does not tell us by what percentage of people randomly chosen to receive the new procedure have a better long-term outcome in terms of quality of life, or die less often of later complications, or any other measurable difference. The outcome assessed in the studies, “functional independence after stroke,” is easy to understand. And the benefits were significant: 53-71% of treated patients were functionally independent following the stroke, compared to 29-40% of untreated patients. The article meets the standard by including this sentence: “The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.” It also notes, “clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner.” Some caution about the fact that we don’t know if that risk will be as low when the procedure is rolled out more widely (as opposed to being used in a highly controlled study environment) would have been welcome. This story is about a set of guidelines and not about a single research study. The guidelines are themselves based on six different randomized trials described elsewhere as of high-quality. Guidelines like these are very carefully considered by a committee. The quote from the story is: “The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,” he said. “It’s really, really good evidence.” The story also notes that the guidelines have been endorsed by other medical societies. In addition, there is discussion of limitations insofar as the story addresses how narrowly one must filter patients in order for them to fit these new guidelines. We think the discussion of evidence is sufficient to convey the quality of the research, but we wouldn’t have minded some additional detail. For example, the related news release issued for the guidelines says: “The evidence backing this new recommendation received the highest rating based on the scientific evidence reviewed, and suggests the benefits substantially outweigh the potential risks in these patients.” and further: “Evidence-based guidelines are based on clinical trials, which tell you that if you have a patient with the same characteristics of those in the trials, on average they will do much better with the treatment than if you treat them another way,” Powers said. There was no disease mongering in this story. The story quotes two experts, one of whom chaired the committee that wrote the guidelines (Powers) and the other (Kandazari) who was apparently independent of the guideline-writing process. The solicitation of an outside expert opinion is commendable, but the story should have notified readers that Dr. Kandazari is a paid consultant for companies, such as Medtronic and Boston Scientific, that make the devices that are used in these procedures. See this Wall Street Journal report and the disclosures on this online CME program. The alternative to endovascular clot retrieval is no procedure, and is made clear in the article. It’s clear from the story that these procedures can only be performed by highly-trained interventionists at specialized stroke treatment centers. The story emphasizes the importance of getting patients to these centers quickly. That’s sufficient for a Satisfactory rating, but it would have been nice to know how many of these stroke centers there are throughout the country. And do most residents in the US live close enough to get to one within the magic short window? We believe the story establishes that the procedure has been under study for some time and that the guidelines issued are new. The story quotes the author of the guidelines, and one other expert who is not an author. It does not rely solely on the news release.",0
"On 15 February 2016, the entertainment web site Empire News published an article claiming that New York state had legalized heroin: The state of New York made history this week, following on the heels of the wave of marijuana legalizations across the country.

"While the release says that the test strips would be inexpensive, there is no indication of what exactly that means. Also, the assumed necessity of multiple strips for different diseases means a wide variety of test strips would be necessary. There is no indication of how the strips might compare in cost to common laboratory diagnostic tests. We know that this research is preliminary and that it might be difficult to give an accurate figure. But if it’s not too early to claim these tests “can confirm presence of infections, some cancers, even before patients feel symptoms,” then it’s not too early to give some sense of what the test might cost. The release indicates that it would be good to diagnose these diseases quickly and cheaply, but there are no hard numbers on how accurate the test strips are or how beneficial it is to diagnose a cold early. While the spread of disease might be a consideration, that is not mentioned in the release. The release doesn’t tell readers how sensitive the paper diagnostics are, or whether their sensitivity and accuracy vary from illness to illness or from medium to medium. For example, does sensitivity vary depending on whether they are analyzing blood or urine? As with all diagnostic tests, there is the risk of false or missed diagnosis that this news release doesn’t address. One can envision a scenario where cheaper, easier-to-use diagnostic tests lead to more frequent testing in situations where tests wouldn’t have been used before. The increased volume of testing could lead to more false-positive results with resulting unnecessary anxiety and treatment. There is no mention of any metrics in this news release. No indication of how well the DNA or RNA amplify or how accurately this occurs. There is no indication of false positive or negative results either. In general, the science behind this development is left out of the news release. The release does not engage in disease mongering. The news release lists all the funding sources for the project. All of the authors are McMasters University faculty or staff. The only corporate funder is Pro-Lab Diagnostics. It is unclear if any of the authors have conflicts of interest with this funding source. There is no mention of which alternative or conventional diagnostic tests the paper strips might replace. The news release makes it clear that this technology is not currently available, but says it “could be commercialized quickly.” That seems a bit optimistic to us, but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt here. In assessing the novelty of the test we took into account that paper diagnostic tools are not a new concept. Organizations such as Diagnostics For All have been working in this field since at least 2007, and paper diagnostic tools have also garnered significant news coverage. For example, MIT Technology Review listed paper diagnostics one of their 10 “breakthrough technologies” in 2009. The field is sufficiently active that there have been at least three different review papers over the past couple of years on research into paper diagnostics: here, here and here. Without some context regarding the field, it’s unclear what is novel about these new research findings or how they advance paper diagnostics. We’ll give the release a pass for this criteria even though the release talks about a new diagnostic test that “can change the medical landscape.” However, we already addressed the question of novelty and won’t ding the sponsor twice for making this claim.",1
"On 17 October 2014, a natural news blog posted an article (which had initially been published over a year earlier by a different alternative health news site) reporting that a “Johns Hopkins scientist … issued a blistering report on influenza vaccines in the British Medical Journal (BMJ).” The article, timed to the start of flu season, spread rapidly on social media sites and sparked renewed interest in the subject of flu vaccines. The article referenced a 16 May 2013 feature by Peter Doshi that was published in the British Medical Journal. However, the importance of that BMJ feature was greatly exaggerated by the natural news sites that used it as the basis for their own articles. Despite BMJ’s authoritative reputation in the medical world, items published by that journal as “features” are not medical studies but rather pieces run under a “News & Views” heading. Readers unfamiliar with the BMJ can easily confuse claims made in feature articles for peer-reviewed research findings. Moreover, Johns Hopkins University had nothing to do with the so-called “blistering report” about flu vaccinations touted in natural news articles Peter Doshi is neither a virologist nor a epidemiologist, but rather an anthropologist who completed a fellowship in comparative effectiveness research at Johns Hopkins. He conducted no research into influenza or vaccines at Johns Hopkins, nor does he speak for the university on that subject. In Peter Doshi’s British Medical Journal feature, he that argued the potential risks of aggressive vaccination against the flu have not been highlighted sufficiently, and that the benefits of the flu shot are overestimated: Today around 135 million doses of influenza vaccine annually enter the US market, with vaccinations administered in drug stores, supermarkets — even some drive-throughs. This enormous growth has not been fueled by popular demand but instead by a public health campaign that delivers a straightforward, who-in-their-right-mind-could-possibly-disagree message: influenza is a serious disease, we are all at risk of complications from influenza, the flu shot is virtually risk free, and vaccination saves lives. Through this lens, the lack of influenza vaccine availability for all 315 million US citizens seems to border on the unethical. Yet across the country, mandatory influenza vaccination policies have cropped up, particularly in healthcare facilities, precisely because not everyone wants the vaccination, and compulsion appears the only way to achieve high vaccination rates. Closer examination of influenza vaccine policies shows that although proponents employ the rhetoric of science, the studies underlying the policy are often of low quality, and do not substantiate officials’ claims. The vaccine might be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza appears overstated. Doshi strongly suggested, without ever actually saying so, that the flu vaccine may not be beneficial at all. But he never came close to proving that point — instead, he continually harped about the notion that the effectiveness of the vaccine (and studies thereof) didn’t apply equally to everyone (an obvious point) and repeatedly picked nits about whether the precise percentages reported in published studies on the vaccine are accurate. As Forbes noted of his claims:  Doshi’s argument against the flu vaccine boils down to this: the vaccine is much less than 100% effective, and it doesn’t work for everyone. This is undeniably true, and the research community makes no secret of it. Meanwhile, though, the annual flu vaccine is usually effective: a recent study showed, for example, that it reduced children’s risk of ending up in a pediatric intensive care unit by 74%. So get your flu shot (or snort) now, before flu season hits, because it takes a couple of weeks for your body to develop immunity. By getting immunized, you’ll not only increase your chances of getting through the winter flu-free, but (because you won’t spread the flu to others) you might also save someone whose immune system would be overwhelmed by influenza. The natural news blog post referencing Doshi’s 2013 BMJ feature also quoted Dr. Russell Blaylock: For most people, says Dr. Blaylock, flu vaccines don’t prevent the flu but actually increase the odds of getting it. The mercury contained in vaccines is such a strong immune depressant that a flu shot suppresses immunity for several weeks. “This makes people highly susceptible to catching the flu,” he says. “They may even think the vaccine gave them the flu, but that’s not true — it depressed their immune system and then they caught the flu.” Blaylock, a former neurosurgeon, has a history of issuing dubious, conspiracy-based warnings about a number of suspected dangers in both science-based medicine and the environment at large, including aspartame, chemtrails, cookware, and dental amalgams. A 2009 profile in a Canadian newspaper quoted Blaylock on his belief that the Affordable Healthcare Act (or Obamacare) was in actuality a depopulation effort: “Knowing they cannot easily pass a euthanasia law or just have them rounded up and exterminated, they (the proponents of socialized medicine) use the medical care system to speed them along to their deaths.” Totalitarianism is coming and, “as the economy worsens, which they can engineer with their Federal Reserve friends, people will be more accepting of such things as euthanasia on the elderly and terminally ill, the insane, the feeble-minded and the chronically ill.” Vaccines are also one of Blaylock’s many targets. He insinuates that the H1N1 virus may be the product of some pharmaceutical research project gone awry, or that it may even be a man-made virus purposely released by someone with the “Illuminati Depopulation Agenda.” Blaylock appears regularly on right-wing radio programs such as the Alex Jones Show, where the popular topics are climate-change fraud and the supposed erosion of civil liberties under Obama. The claims made by Doshi and echoed by Blaylock hinge on a flawed, two-pronged premise: flu vaccines are a large moneymaker for pharmaceutical companies, and the vaccines aren’t really beneficial because the flu isn’t that bad and healthy people don’t die from it. First, the flu shot is not nearly as profitable to pharmaceutical companies as many imagine, generating less than one percent of global pharmaceutical company revenues. By contrast, an actual flu epidemic would likely generate far larger profits for those companies: Worldwide sales of flu vaccines in 2013 was around $3.1 billion, according to estimates of a healthcare market research firm. But let’s put this in context of the worldwide sales of all pharmaceutical products in 2013 — nearly $1 trillion. In other words, various flu vaccines make up less than 0.3% of worldwide sales of Big Pharma, so from a strategic point of view, it’s not that interesting. Just for context, cholesterol lowering drugs, like statins, sold more than $33 billion two years ago. If I were a Big Pharma executive, I’d be telling my R&D and Marketing divisions to invest in new statins, because the potential return on investment could be 10X higher. Vaccines in general have a lower net profit than other pharmaceuticals. There are many reasons for the lower profit for vaccines, but it’s mostly due to shipping and spoilage loss. For flu vaccines, it’s actually much worse. Flu vaccines are only useful for one flu season, so anything unsold at the end of the flu season is destroyed. Thus, if you look at flu vaccine as a profit center for Big Pharma, there really are better strategic and tactical choices for pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), tens of thousands of people (many otherwise healthy) die each year of the flu. The agency reported in 2013 that 90 percent of juvenile patients who died of the flu in that season had not been vaccinated: Pediatric deaths are defined as flu-associated deaths that occur in people younger than 18 years. An early look at this season’s reports indicates that about 90 percent occurred in children who had not received a flu vaccination this season. This review also indicated that 60 percent of deaths occurred in children who were at high risk of developing serious flu-related complications, but 40 percent of these children had no recognized chronic health problems. The proportions of pediatric deaths occurring in children who were unvaccinated and those who had high-risk conditions are consistent with what has been seen in previous seasons. Finally, much of the objection to flu vaccine marketing makes mention of the varying strains of influenza that circulate each year. A 2013 study indicated the flu shot can “provide cross protection against non-matching circulating strains” even if they are not exactly matched.",1
"On 6 May 2016, the web site Straight Stoned published an article reporting that anti-abortion groups decided that masturbation was murder, because of the waste of sperm cells involved: The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice. “Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!” Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick p*rnos on P*rnHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” The image attached to the story featured a group of women protesting, one of whom was holding a sign that read “Ejaculation is Murder.” However, the image dated to 2014, and the original was subjected to some fairly obvious manipulation: Unlike many fake news sites, Straight Stoned included a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer heavily insinuating its content was not meant to be taken seriously: Your #1 Source For So Called “News”",1
"The approval was widely expected after the European Medicines Agency endorsed the drug in November. European health regulators typically follow EMA recommendations within a couple of months. Tecfidera will be the third oral MS drug available in Europe. However, if its impressive early performance in the United States is any indication, the Biogen drug is likely to surpass sales of Novartis’ Gilenya and Aubagio from Sanofi. Tecfidera has consistently shattered Wall Street sales forecasts and is well on the way to racking up more than $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market. Biogen reported Tecfidera sales of $398 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, only the medicine’s third full quarter since winning U.S. approval. It is also approved for sale in Canada and Australia. The introduction in Europe will start in the coming weeks, although its full roll-out will take place over the course of this year and next as Biogen must negotiate reimbursement for the treatment on a country by country basis. First up will be Germany, “where you can get pricing reimbursement rather quickly,” Tony Kingsley, Biogen’s head of global commercial operations, said in a telephone interview. “We’re ready to go,” said Kingsley, adding that Biogen’s Germany sales force for the new drug has been in place for months. Tecfidera’s prospects in Europe had been in doubt at one stage because of uncertainty about protection against generic copies. This issue was resolved in November when Biogen won 10 years of regulatory exclusivity. There are an estimated 400,000 people in Europe with multiple sclerosis. Biogen declined to comment on what type of market share Tecfidera was likely to seize in Europe. “We’re very encouraged by our U.S. experience,” Kingsley said. Robert W Baird analyst Christopher Raymond forecast 2014 Tecfidera sales outside the United States of $291 million. Looking further ahead, analysts on average forecast annual worldwide sales of the drug reaching some $6 billion by 2019, with more than a third of that coming from Europe and other non-U.S. markets, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma.",0
"The release provides no cost information on the drug and the additional testing and additional radiographic work that would be part of this treatment. The release lacks information on key outcomes such as months of disease-free survival or death rates. This is the closest we get to any quantification of benefits: “We showed that a subset of men whose tumours had mutations in their DNA repair machinery responded particularly well to treatment with olaparib.” No harms are mentioned. Summaries of studies need qualifiers. The trial was a controlled clinical trial (not observational) in that the researchers selected the subjects and decided what to treat them with. But it wasn’t randomized or blinded which made it ripe for potential biases. The subset of men in this study were dying of prostate cancer. There was no disease mongering about their condition. We recognize that it can be challenging to sort out and explain complex partnerships in a brief news release but it is better to point out that potential conflicts exist. Although the release mentions a pharmaceutical backer of the study (AstraZeneca) and lists other funders, the vast majority of investigators had multiple, complex ties to pharmaceutical makers including some who have patents and other commercial interests in the success of these treatments. These are mostly highly financially conflicted researchers whose conflicts are never mentioned in the news release, even though we know that such financial entanglement will mean that any news release will put the best possible face on the outcome of their research. This criteria doesn’t apply since all the gene-specified patients were given the same treatment. The release implies that the study enrolled patients whose alternative treatments had failed, but it doesn’t say what those treatments were. We’ll rate this Not Applicable. The story nods to the availability of the drug used in the study in the UK when it says it “was licensed last year for women with ovarian cancer and inherited BRCA mutations, but so far has not been approved for use on the NHS by NICE or the Cancer Drugs Fund.” However, we aren’t left with any idea if the gene testing carried out here is widely available. That’s a critical point that should have been addressed. The release states that this is the “First trial to show benefit of ‘precision medicine’ in prostate cancer.” We suspect that this kind of prostate cancer mutation-specific targeting is novel for prostate cancer. It isn’t in the field of oncology in general, however. There is some unjustified language here that is inappropriate including the phrases: “pioneering drug,” “a milestone in cancer treatment,” ” a significant step forward” and “cutting-edge genomic sequencing, and “highly effective at treating men with DNA repair defects.” Let’s recall that the drug hasn’t been shown to help anyone live longer.",1
"An estimated 88,000 people die in the United States each year from drinking too much alcohol, but only one out of six adults overall and one in four binge drinkers have discussed their drinking habits with their doctors, according to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That practice needs to change, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. “It should be a part of routine patient care,” Frieden said. “In the same way we screen patients for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, we should be screening for excess alcohol use.”  The study’s findings were based on 166,000 interviews in 44 states and the District of Columbia in 2011. The percentage of patients who had ever discussed their drinking with a health care provider ranged from a low of 8.7 percent in Kansas to 25.5 percent in Washington, D.C.  Doctors are often too busy to screen patients for alcohol abuse and may view treatment options as ineffective, the CDC said. But asking patients about their alcohol use and then offering advice on how to reduce it, or referring the most serious cases for specialized treatment, can be effective in many cases, Frieden said. “Counseling for five, 10, 15 minutes can result in a substantial reduction in problem drinking,” he said. Drinking too much can increase chances of heart disease, liver damage, breast cancer and other health problems, the CDC said. The CDC defines binge drinking as five or more drinks in a few hours for men and four or more for women. Adult men should average no more than two drinks a day and women no more than one daily, the health agency said. The federal Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires new insurance plans to cover alcohol screening with no patient co-pay, Frieden said.",0
"We like this story’s approach. The story could have easily stated that it’s just too early to know – end of story. Instead, it stated: The story gave very specific details on what happened to trial subjects’ cell counts – and over what span of time. Of course it’s too soon to know if those lab results will translate into differences in the peoples’ lives. But a MedPage Today story carried a more significant statement from a member of the conference program committee:  “We do not know yet from the experiments whether there is any antiviral activity.” Good job in saying: “The only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety” Lots of details on what the evidence showed. Many caveats included. There could have been some more, though. A MedPageToday story stated “all six patients involved in the study had well-controlled HIV, so it was impossible to see if there would be a therapeutic effect.” That same story also noted that another presentation at the same meeting gave results of a similar process in mouse research – but the protective effect wore off over time. This AP story could have included that same information to be more complete. The story also could have included a reminder that the research was published only as a short abstract and presented at a scientific conference – and that it had not undergone the kind of rigorous peer review that a journal article would be expected to undergo. No disease mongering here. Several independent sources were quoted. Within the realm of other gene therapy attempts, the story explained, “This is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV” The story  made it clear that this was a very preliminary report. The story explained this was the first test of the new approach and that a report on a second, federally-funded study was due in another day. It’s clear that the story did not rely on a news release.",0
"On 14 June 2016, unreliable web site Gateway Pundit published an article suggesting that London Mayor Sadiq Khan — who is Muslim — “banned” provocative advertisements because they offended Islam: What a complete shock! London’s new Muslim mayor plans to ban sexy women in advertisements in London’s public transport system. Allahu Akbar! The Gateway Pundit referenced earlier reporting from Daily Caller: Sadiq Khan, London’s first Muslim mayor, announced Monday that “body shaming” advertisements will no longer be allowed in London’s public transport … Recently, advertisements featuring bikini-clad models in the British city of Birmingham were spray painted over. Birmingham has a high Muslim population. On 13 June 2016, Khan tweeted: No one’s confidence or body image should be undermined by ads on our transport system. I’ve strengthened @TfL policy https://t.co/AJ7qYDQW0T — Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) June 13, 2016 On 13 June 2016, the Evening Standard published an article with further information about Khan’s policy. According to the piece, only a small fraction of advertisements in London would be affected by the policy change: Adverts which put Londoners under pressure over body image are to be banned from the Tube and bus network. Sadiq Khan announced that Transport for London would no longer run ads which could cause body confidence issues, particularly among young people. The Mayor, a father of two teenage daughters, warned the ads could “demean” women and encourage them to conform to unrealistic or unhealthy body shapes. TfL’s new advertising policy, which does not include all images of people in their underwear or swimming gear, is only expected to affect a handful of the 12,000 adverts a year which run across the network, including at bus shelters and on-street sites. Khan was quoted on the reasons he opted to enact the new policy: As the father of two teenage girls, I am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people, particularly women, and make them ashamed of their bodies. It is high time it came to an end … Nobody should feel pressurised, while they travel on the Tube or bus, into unrealistic expectations surrounding their bodies and I want to send a clear message to the advertising industry about this. As for the mayor’s motivations, the outlet reported that public outcry (not Khan’s religion) was a major cause for the action: It means controversial adverts like Protein World’s “Are you beach body ready?” poster, which provoked a huge backlash when it appeared last year, would no longer be allowed. The weight-loss ad, which featured a bikini-clad model, sparked a protest in Hyde Park as well as a petition on Change.org with more than 70,000 signatures, although it was not banned by the Advertising Standards Authority … The change comes a result of passenger feedback, rather than public consultation, but City Hall denied it was nannying Londoners. As the Evening Standard reported, the change came in part as a result of massive public outcry over one specific ad. A Change.org petition gathered more than 70,000 signatures, and its grievances were unrelated to Islam: Protein World is directly targeting individuals, aiming to make them feel physically inferior to the unrealistic* body image of the bronzed model, in order to sell their product. *for the majority of people to ‘achieve’: everyone has an individual body shape Perhaps not everyone’s priority is having a ‘beach body’ (by the way, what is that? ), and making somebody feel guilty for not prioritising it by questioning their personal choices is a step too far. A body’s function is far more intricate and important than looking ‘beach ready’, so in fact it is Protein World who have confused their priorities, if anyone. The question I would like to pose to whoever gave this advert the go-ahead would be: what is ‘Beach Body Ready’? And who would not be? Khan didn’t specify how standards for advertisements on public transit would be strengthened, but no credible reporting indicated that all “sexy” or revealing advertisements would be banned across London. The ban will solely affect “body shaming” content, not bikinis or scantily-clad women.",1
"""In a Dallas-area call on behalf of a jailed niece, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Texas law enforcement agencies consistently rank him fairest of them all. In his Aug. 3, 2013, call to the Allen Police Department, a recording of which was later released in response to a request from NBC 5, KXAS-TV, Dewhurst inquired into what he needed to do to hasten the release of Ellen Bevers, described in the station’s news report as a schoolteacher detained for allegedly shoplifting at a grocery store. His call did not yield special treatment; Bevers was released after posting bond the next day, according to an Aug. 22, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. But critics including Dewhurst challengers in the 2014 Republican primary charged him with trying to throw his weight around. Readers zeroed in on a curious Dewhurst claim. """"Sergeant, you don't know me,"""" Dewhurst is heard saying on the police call, """"but I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas."""" First and foremost? Agencies do not rank officeholders, we found, though law officer associations make candidate endorsements as do other advocacy groups with an interest in what happens in government. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed out that Dewhurst was endorsed by several officer groups in his 2006 re-election race and in his 2012 U.S. Senate race. Also, Considine noted, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas deemed Dewhurst its Texas Crime Fighter of the Year in 2003, his first year in what many consider the state’s most powerful post. A Nov. 24, 2003, association press release credits Dewhurst with steering reforms in drunken-driving laws and helping on other measures. CLEAT spokesman Charlie Wilkison is quoted describing Dewhurst as a """"real friend"""" to the state’s law enforcement community. By telephone, Wilkison, poised to become the group’s executive director, told us that in 2012 the association gave Dewhurst a lifetime achievement award thanks to his consistent support over the years. Especially notable, Wilkison said, Dewhurst has repeatedly volunteered to keynote a biennial Texas Capitol ceremony honoring fallen officers at which he comforts survivors including children, one by one. Wilkison said he believes that in the call to the police department, Dewhurst meant to say he was No. 1 with law enforcement groups, instead making a common semantic mistake by saying """"agencies."""" Like representatives of other law enforcement advocacy groups that have supported Dewhurst in elections, Wilkison agreed that agencies do not rank officeholders; the agencies are supposed to be politically disinterested. Kevin Lawrence, executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association, another influential group, said by phone that it has enjoyed a great relationship with Dewhurst. """"Law enforcement agencies have no business endorsing candidates,"""" Lawrence said, and while associations or unions make candidate endorsements, they do not pick one officeholder over another--assigning ranks, that is--unless the officeholders face each other on the ballot. """"Associations don’t sit around saying who is our favorite politician,"""" Lawrence said. Gary Chandler, a Department of Public Safety sergeant and president of the DPS Officers Association, later said by phone: """"We don’t rank the government officials or public officials,"""" instead focusing on trooper salaries and benefits. Then again, Chandler said: """"As government works, the lieutenant governor of Texas is a very powerful person. We have worked with David Dewhurst the last three"""" legislative """"sessions at least."""" He said that personally, Dewhurst """"has been my No. 1 guy,"""" though every legislator """"is important to us when it comes to accomplishing our goals… I wouldn’t mind calling them all No. 1 at some point."""" Lacking any sign of agencies ranking officeholders, we turned back to Considine, who said the cited endorsements demonstrate Dewhurst's appeal to law enforcement organizations. Our ruling Dewhurst said  that """"every year, I'm the No.1 pick of all the law enforcement agencies in Texas."""" This declaration falters in substantive ways. Law enforcement agencies do not rank elected officials against one another in any way. Nor do law enforcement advocacy groups, though Dewhurst has drawn multiple re-election endorsements. Then again, such endorsements do not occur every year. The election for lieutenant governor occurs every four years. We rate this claim as . -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  – The statement is not accurate.""",1
"The country’s agriculture ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu had been detected on six poultry farms and that there had been 13 cases in migratory birds since the first outbreak earlier this month. No human infection has been reported, while the ministry is looking into four additional reports from poultry farms and more than 50 other suspected cases in migratory birds, it said in a statement on Monday. Asia’s fourth-largest economy has had four bird flu outbreaks in the past 10 years, without any cases of human infection reported. South Korea will slaughter over 1.4 million farm birds, including 644,000 that have already been killed, according to the ministry. That would be under 1 percent of the country’s total 160 million poultry population. The first case of H5N8 bird flu was found on January17 at a duck farm in the southwestern province of North Jeolla, about 300 km (186 miles) from Seoul. The government is stepping up disinfection measures for migratory bird at 37 sites across the country as it suspects they are the source of the latest outbreak. It will also control the movement of some livestock workers in affected areas ahead of the Luna New Year holidays from Thursday through Sunday when many Koreans travel to family gatherings.",0
"The vaccine, Ervebo, is approved for individuals aged 18 years and older and has already been used under emergency guidelines to try to protect against the spread of a deadly Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo. The shot is also being reviewed by U.S. health regulators and a decision is expected in the first quarter of next year. The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects. Since the middle of last year, the Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people, making it the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, after the 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. “The EU is supporting international efforts to combat Ebola on all fronts, from vaccine development to delivering humanitarian aid on the ground,” EU Ebola Coordinator Christos Stylianides said in a statement dated Nov. 10. Merck has said its priority was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine “can be used to support global public health preparedness”.",1
"English far-right activist Tommy Robinson was given a 13-month prison sentence on 25 May 2018, following a Facebook Live video he broadcast from outside a trial of several men accused of a range of child sexual abuse offenses. The sentence prompted a wave of outrage and protests (mostly, but not entirely, among various factions of the far right) and claims that Robinson’s rights to free speech were being violated in the interests of political correctness; Robinson stated in the video that many of the defendants were Muslim. On 28 May 2018, the “alternative medicine” and conspiracy theory site NaturalNews.com claimed that Robinson had been silenced without due process in order to “protect Muslim pedophiles” because “the UK government is run by criminal pedophiles who rely on Muslim pedo networks to provide a steady supply of nine and ten-year-old little girls and boys.” Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones described the episode as “historic” and his Infowars web site called the arrest of Robinson “the beginning of the end for free speech in Europe.” These claims are based on a wild misunderstanding of a very basic principle in the legal system of England and Wales, and of other parts of the U.K. Far from being a “historic” violation of due process, Robinson was jailed because a court judged he had breached the terms of an existing suspended sentence for contempt of court by violating a set of reporting restrictions often placed on the news media and others in the United Kingdom in order to protect the due process rights of defendants and prevent the collapse of trials, something that could jeopardize the conviction of potentially guilty and dangerous individuals. The “media blackout” on the child sexual abuse trial referred to by NaturalNews.com was not designed to “protect Muslim pedophiles,” but rather to protect the integrity of the child sexual abuse trial itself, prevent a costly re-trial, and avoid witnesses having to go through the trauma of testifying in court again. Reporting restrictions such as those imposed in the child sexual abuse case in question are temporary, meaning that the news media can reveal previously-censored details after the trial has concluded. So Robinson was not jailed for engaging in journalism, or for merely reporting on alleged criminality. He was jailed for violating a court order, breaching the terms of an existing suspended sentence, and potentially risking the collapse of an ongoing trial. Background In May 2017, Robinson — the founder of the far-right, conspiracy-mongering English Defence League, and whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon — was arrested for contempt of court after filming inside Canterbury Crown Court in the south-eastern English county of Kent. As reported by Kent Online at the time, Robinson pleaded guilty to contempt and apologized. He had confronted some of the defendants inside the court building as they left while filming footage which he later uploaded online. Robinson accused police of helping the defendants “escape.” In sentencing him on 26 May 2017, Judge Heather Norton said: This is not about free speech… not about the freedom of the Press, nor about legitimate journalism, and not about political correctness. It is about justice and ensuring that a trial can be carried out justly and fairly..it’s about being innocent until proven guilty. It is about preserving the integrity of the jury to continue without people being intimidated..or being affected by irresponsible and inaccurate “reporting”, if that’s what it was. …You made it abundantly clear that your mission was to film the defendants, who you referred to by their religion, as ‘Muslim child rapists’ and ‘Muslim paedophiles’. …I take a very dim view of your conduct, which was in the face of repeated warnings…There are notices all over the court building making it clear that filming or taking a photograph was an offence and may be a contempt of court. You were told very clearly by the security staff at this court that you were to stop filming. Robinson was given a three-month prison sentence, but it was suspended for 18 months on the condition that he did not commit any more criminal offenses. The Facebook Live video A year later, on 25 May 2018, Robinson showed up outside Leeds Crown Court in the northern English county of Yorkshire and began broadcasting a Facebook Live video. In the video, Robinson confronted men whom he presented as defendants in an ongoing child sexual abuse case, made it clear it was his aim to identify them and show their faces on camera, named several men and listed the purported charges against them, and in one instance encouraged the “mainstream media” to harass a man he had earlier shown on camera, as he arrived in court. According to the Hull Daily Mail, some of the charges Robinson associated with named defendants were inaccurate. That type of factual error — broadcast to a potentially huge audience  — could have serious consequences in a criminal trial. During the course of the 75-minute video, Robinson openly declared “there is a reporting restriction on this case,” acknowledged that he was already on a suspended sentence for contempt of court and said “I have to be super-careful.” The closing moments of the video showed police arresting Robinson outside the court for breach of the peace, a public order offense. Later that day, Judge Geoffrey Marson of Leeds Crown Court gave Robinson a 13-month prison sentence for contempt of court and violating his existing suspended sentence, ruling that the content of his Facebook Live video had the potential to prejudice and collapse the ongoing trial. Robinson had pleaded guilty. According to LeedsLive, Marson watched the Facebook video in court before telling Robinson:  No one could possibly conclude that it [the video] would be anything other than highly prejudicial to the defendants in the trial. I respect everyone’s right to free speech. That’s one of the most important rights that we have. With those rights come responsibilities. The responsibility to exercise that freedom of speech within the law. I am not sure you appreciate the potential consequence of what you have done. …You have to understand we are not preventing publication. We are postponing publication to ensure that the trial is fair. The Hull Daily Mail quoted Marson as giving concrete examples of the harm that Robinson’s video had the potential to cause: If the jurors in my present trial get to know of this video I will no doubt be faced with an application to discharge the jury. If I have to do that it will mean a re-trial, costing hundreds and hundreds and thousands of pounds. A re-trial would also mean witnesses in the case would have to face the ordeal of giving evidence again before a jury. Marson placed reporting restrictions on Robinson’s arrest and sentencing, but those restrictions were lifted after a successful application by LeedsLive on 29 May. In a textbook example of how reporting restrictions postpone but do not prohibit acts of journalism, local and national news media honored Marson’s order over the weekend and refrained from reporting on Robinson’s sentencing until the order was lifted. The reporting restrictions in the child sexual abuse case remain in place. Strict rules The UK news media faces strict rules on what they can and cannot publish about an ongoing trial. Some of these are in place by default, while others require a court order and are at the discretion of judges. For example, the complainant, or victim, in a sexual assault case cannot be named, unless they waive their automatic right to anonymity, but it might require a court order for the media to be restrained from publishing the identity of — for example — a minor or a vulnerable witness. Guidelines in place in the UK state that a judge can postpone, but not prohibit, the publication of otherwise “fair and accurate reports.” The overarching principle in place is to avoid the publication of anything which “creates a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the administration of justice” if it is published during a trial.",1
"“He’s a genuinely happy kid,” Kolen says of her son, a bright boy who loves nature and paleontology and has never been defined by his diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome, a mild form of autism marked by social awkwardness and narrow interests that make personal relationships challenging. Matthew’s diagnosis will soon be dropped in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic reference book, to be subsumed into the broader category of autism spectrum disorder. Although autism can range from highly functioning individuals like Matthew to those with severe speech and intellectual disabilities, in general individuals struggle with difficulties in communication, behavior and social interaction. Dropping the Asperger’s diagnosis in the new DSM, due out this spring, has caused consternation for some families. “One of the biggest concerns is that some who are higher functioning will no longer meet the more stringent criteria and will therefore have difficulty getting services,” says Dr. Elizabeth Laugeson, an autism researcher at the University of California Los Angeles. An analysis by Dr. Fred Volkmar of the Yale School of Medicine released earlier this year suggested as many as 45 percent of those currently diagnosed with autism or a related disorder would no longer qualify under the new definition. Laugeson said Volkmar’s analysis was based on a review of older medical records that might not have captured all of the symptoms that would qualify a person for an autism diagnosis under the new standard. The jury is still out in terms of how the change will play out in routine practice, she said: “We really need to see it in action.”  To ease fears that some individuals will no longer be eligible for services and insurance coverage, the APA task force recommends that people already diagnosed with an autism-related disorder, such as Asperger’s, would be grandfathered in. Kolen, who has never been caught up in labels, says she is not concerned about the change. Although Matthew was officially diagnosed with Asperger’s in second grade, his preschool teachers were the first to point out his differences. By age 4, he began applied behavior analysis or ABA therapy, a specialized type of therapy used to treat autism. “That really put us on a good path,” Kolen says, adding that at that age, “no one was willing to put a label on him, but they would treat what they saw.”  In addition to Asperger’s, Matthew is now being treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD and has recently developed some issues with anxiety - conditions that commonly accompany autism spectrum disorders. Like many on the autism spectrum, Matthew finds it difficult to make eye contact. “I can’t stare into someone’s eyes,” he says. “It just hurts.”  On Wednesdays, Matthew attends a social group with other young people on the autism spectrum, where they work on improving their social skills. While they all have the same or similar difficulties, they can recognize social awkwardness in others. Kolen says her son still struggles with the give and take of conversation. “It’s very difficult for him to allow the other person to speak. He’s still tends to dominate.”  But Matthew is bright, and she believes with enough practice, he will learn how to respond appropriately to social cues, even if he’s “a little rough around the edges.”  “My goal is to make sure that in the end, he has a place to work, earning a living and supporting himself in what he loves to do,” says Kolen.",0
"""An Internet claim that Missouri employers will gain the right to fire people who use birth control when a state bill becomes law is incorrect. """"Missouri Votes to Let Employers Fire People Who Use Birth Control,"""" reads a headline from Feministing. """"A new Missouri bill would target abortion providers and sanction employment and housing discrimination against people who use birth control or have an abortion,"""" writes Sejal Singh, Feministing columnist, in the article. A St. Louis ordinance passed in February prohibits discrimination because of reproductive health care decisions. But Missouri Senate Bill 5, or SB 5, which was signed by the governor in July, will overturn that local ordinance when it takes effect in October. Since SB 5 was signed, we’ve seen claims that the bill would allow for employers to fire workers for using birth control. But we found no evidence that that’s true. Singh told PolitiFact Missouri she based her commentary on the analysis of news articles. Allure, Refinery29, and Newsweek were just a few among media sources that reported the bill would allow for employees to fire people for using birth control. Newsweek came out with an updated article stating that it, among other publications, had erroneously reported on the bill. Many of these news organizations referenced NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, which ran an ad online and on the radio that read, """"Do you think your boss should be able to fire you for using birth control?"""" This ad only ran for one week, but its interpretation of the bill was influential to many of those articles. According to Alison Dreith, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, it was the rhetoric of Republicans and not the actual language that led to this interpretation. """"It still remains to be seen if SB 5 will pre-empt the St. Louis ordinance,"""" Dreith said in an email interview. The bill, signed by the governor in late July, touches on a lot of provisions, such as tissue report modifications, local abortion policies, employee disclosure policies and abortion facility inspections. Under the political subdivision authority part of the bill, it allows property owners to refuse to rent or sell to a person who plans to use the facility as an abortion clinic that isn’t for the sole purpose of saving the mother’s life. Within the same guidelines, it also doesn’t require healthcare providers or employers to provide coverage """"that includes benefits that are not otherwise required by state law."""" Employers in Missouri are already allowed to deny contraceptive coverage in their employee’s health insurance plans. Daniel Wilhelm, with Republican Rep. Andrew Koenig’s office, said the bill does not reference birth control or contraceptives, except under circumstances where employers can refuse health care if they don’t want to pay for birth control. Elizabeth Sepper, a professor of law at Washington University, said in an email that no matter what Missouri does, federal law bars an employer with 15 or more employees from discriminating against employees based on their reproductive choices, such as taking contraception. Even with the passing of the bill, Sepper said St. Louis’ city ordinance still prevents employers from firing employees who use birth control, and SB 5 doesn’t affect that protection. A columnist for Feministing claimed that SB 5 will allow employers to fire their workers for using birth control. While the bill will impose higher level of restrictions on abortion providers and allow real estate agents to refuse to sell or rent them land, the bill does not say employers can fire workers for using contraceptives.""",1
"""This sounds like a lengthy and involved procedure that would require expensive technical expertise during surgery. The device itself has to be very expensive. Because there are lower-tech surgical alternatives and non-surgical alternatives, insurance companies may be slow to cover this sort of procedure. Given that, it would have been nice to see a ballpark figure for how much this costs. The story doesn’t spend a lot of time with the numbers, but it does a pretty good job capturing the potential benefits. The fourth sentence talks about the potential harms, a rarity for any health story. In fact, the whole second paragraph should be part of a template for most health writing. """"Findings from the clinical trials show that the telescope does improve vision for the majority of patients. Still, there are some concerns about corneal damage, since the telescope is relatively large inside the eye. And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. The treatment doesn’t work for those who have had cataract surgery. And for those who catch the disease early on, there may be better options."""" One of our reviewers just printed that out and taped it to his computer screen. The story does a good job of explaining the evidence in absolute numbers and in percentages. So, if you think that it sounds impressive that 75% of the patients had major improvements in their vision, you can check that against the fact that 10 out of 219 patients had corneal problems after the surgery. It would have been good to explain how vision improvement was measured. Was it through objective vision tests or through a Q&A with patients or both? The story starts out by saying the procedure """"could help millions of older adults who are nearly blinded by macular degeneration."""" This isn’t quite disease mongering, and, if we look at the disease globally, that’s potentially true. In the U.S. alone, according to the American Health Assistance Foundation, about 1.75 million Americans age 40 who suffer from acute macular degeneration. But the story then makes it clear that not all of them would be candidates for this procedure. Given that """"millions"""" are used in the lead, it would have been smart to follow up with a more realistic number of how many might actually benefit. The bottom third of the story relies heavily, perhaps too much so, on Dr. George Williams, a retinal surgeon given the vague title of """"associated with the American Academy of Ophthalmology."""" Those quibbles aside, Williams provides some great insight and counterbalancing information. It also explains that the other expert in the story, Dr. Kathryn A. Colby, was one of the principal investigators in the story. Again, this could be a model for other stories. It places the new surgery in the context of existing surgeries and compares it to drug treatments, even explaining how those treatments and surgeries are performed, all in just a few sentences. Every story should have a section like this: """"Cataract surgery removes the natural lens and, in most cases, replaces it with an artificial lens, which means there is no foundation for the telescope. And for patients who are in the early stages of macular degeneration, Williams says that medications approved just six years ago are effective and a lot less invasive than the telescope. The drugs are injected directly into the eye on a monthly basis. And with this treatment, doctors are able to prevent severe visual loss in over 90 percent of patients. In nearly half of all patients, visual improvement is significant."""" The only thing that would have made this better is if the reporter had asked at least one more source besides Williams for comments and context. The story makes it clear that this is an experimental study and says that the FDA plans to monitor the side effects for five years. We’re not quite sure why this story was coming out now given that the FDA approved this device at the beginning of the month. (Read about it.) How widely available is it? Never made crystal clear. The story puts the procedure into the right context. It could be more clear about whether there are similar devices out there that improve vision. (There are.) This story does not rely on a news release.""",0
"There is no discussion of the costs of mammography. While making an attempt to quantify benefits, the author frames the information in confusing language that appears to indicate cause and effect:  “women who underwent screening reduced the risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent.”  Mammography is screening, not treatment, and does not prevent or cure breast cancer. Citing the conflicting evidence about the benefits of breast cancer screening would improve the quality of the article. For instance, in two large, randomized clinical trials that looked at the benefits of screening mammography for survival, the Malmo and Canadian trials, the women who chose mammography screening had the same breast cancer mortality or death rate as the women who did not. The article refers briefly to “overtreatment” but fails to explain this or other potential harms. This article underplayed the limitations of the original study. Crucial details are absent in this article, such as the way in which the women were “invited” into the study (a term used in the original abstract,) how it was determined the women died of breast cancer,  what type of cancer was diagnosed, whether or not there was appropriate treatment,  and the effects of lead-time bias,where patients do not live longer but know about their cancer longer. The story should have emphasized that this was a case-control study and should have explained limitations inherent in such a design, making the story’s causality comments inappropriate. A statistical reference to the number of women who are diagnosed and die from breast cancer would be useful, but there is no direct evidence of disease-mongering. Although there is no specific indication of whether or not there is a conflict of interest ,the article is considered satisfactory because it names the source of the study and provides one independent source, Dr. Stephanie Burnik. There is no discussion of alternatives to “routine mammograms” although the article does mention the debate as to the best schedule and age to begin. The clear alternative is not to be screened. Not applicable. The study was in the Netherlands, which has a national screening program. Screening mammography is not a new approach to detecting breast cancer. This article clearly states it is based on a publication in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention Dec. 6,2011.",1
"In early March 2018, a clickbait web site called PixelPolitics.com (which also bears another title on the page itself, “Any Politics”) was among several sites spreading a story about Joy Behar purportedly losing her job on current-events television talk show The View: ABC to Fire Joy Behar from ‘The View’ [In February 2018], Joy Behar bashed Vice President Mike Pence and his Christian faith on her talk show “The View.” Now, it has come back to bite her in a huge way. Behar responded by saying that Pence’s talking to Jesus is not a sign of faith, but a sign of “mental illness.” “It’s one thing to talk to Jesus. It’s another thing when Jesus talks to you. That’s called mental illness, if I’m not correct, hearing voices,” Behar said. While the headline contained the claim that the network was “firing” Behar, its final lines contradicted that claim, instead encouraging readers to share the link if they agreed the host ought to lose her job: Since the comments were made, ABC has not punished Behar in any way, and she has continued to spew her nonsense. Last week, Behar claimed that attendees of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) “have a penchant for Nazis.” SHARE this story if you think ABC should FIRE Joy Behar!",1
"The cost of this device isn’t discussed, despite plans to put it on the market. The release noted that the standard way of diagnosing brain injuries are through CT scans. These tests run more than $1,000 a pop, at least in the U.S. The release might have noted how much this test would cost in comparison. Further, if the outcomes of the test are not improved US insurance companies are unlikely to pay for it. The news release states that the device “will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.” A physician was quoted stating that the test was designed “to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization.” But it did not give sufficient data to demonstrate all of those claims. The accuracy of the test is not described by the release nor is it clear if the test improves care in any way. Also, important long term outcomes (disability, difficulty concentrating, etc.) were not part of the study so any claims made on these outcomes would be inappropriate. The news release did state that measuring the level of one protein, H-FABP, “makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients,” based on a study of patients who had already been admitted to a hospital after undergoing a shock to the head. It stated: “The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.” The release also stated — prematurely — that the company is “currently preparing an even more effective TBIcheck, which will allow 50% of patients to be sent home,” based on the levels of two proteins. The news release did not mention harms, such as missing an injury due to a false negative or having a false positive result that leads to unnecessary and potentially expensive follow-up tests and treatments. With 100% sensitivity there will be no false negatives, but that is a suspect result. It’s not clear what actions are (or are not taken) as a result of this test so it is hard to assess potential harms. There was no data on the accuracy of this test. How often does it falsely give a negative result? And how often are people referred for further testing or evaluation when they don’t have an injury? The news release didn’t say. More importantly, it doesn’t appear that this test has been studied in a randomized clinical trial, so there’s no evidence that patients who use it would have better outcomes or reduced costs compared with patients who are treated using current practices. That wasn’t explained in the news release. The published study provides the sensitivity and specificity of the test but these results are only hinted at in the news release. The news release doesn’t engage in disease-mongering; potential concussions are very common. It also provides useful context on the frequency of suspected traumatic brain injury in the UK. The news release stated that the test sponsor, the University of Geneva, holds a patent on the test which was developed by two of the study’s authors who founded the company that will sell the test. The news release stated that the “only reliable diagnosis is the CT Scan, which is only available in some hospitals and, in addition to being expensive, exposes patients to radiations.” This is misleading. In fact, diagnosing a concussion is complicated. Patients are usually assessed by a doctor using the Glasgow Coma Scale—a series of physical tests for determining the level of consciousness. A CT scan can also be used in order to detect severe brain injury such as bleeding and swelling. However, patients suspected of having a concussion don’t always show signs of brain damage when scanned. The news release stated that the device will be marketed starting in 2019 by a company called ABCDx. However, it would have been helpful to readers to point out whether or not the device must receive regulatory approvals or any details about the types of patients for whom it is recommended. At least one other blood test to evaluate concussions has been given the green light to be marketed in the U.S., and that’s not mentioned. HealthNewsReview.org reviewed a news release and a CNN story about that device. The headline — “A brain injury diagnosed with a single drop of blood” — was among several examples of language in this news release that exaggerated the benefits of this test. Another was that patients will have “No more doubts!” about whether they might have a concussion. It is not clear that this test will improve outcomes in any way.",1
"China has been beset by a series of product safety scandals over the past few years. At least six children died in 2008 after drinking milk contaminated by the industrial chemical melamine, and there have also been reports of children dying or becoming seriously ill from faulty encephalitis, hepatitis B and rabies vaccines. State news agency Xinhua said that of the seven deaths from the hepatitis B vaccine in the latest case, four were in the southern province of Guangdong. The other cases were in the provinces of Hunan and Sichuan. The official China Daily said that all hospitals using the vaccine, made by Shenzhen-based BioKangtai, had been ordered to take it off their shelves while the Health Ministry investigates the company’s products and the deaths. The company said in a statement last week, carried by state media, said that it rigorously followed safety rules but that they were testing the batches suspected of causing the deaths. The topic has been widely discussed on China’s popular Twitter-like microblogging service Sina Weibo, with many people worried about the safety of China’s vaccines and calling on the government to make more information public. “Why was this allowed onto the market? The government needs to come clean about this,” wrote one Weibo user. Many Chinese people are suspicious that the government tries to cover up bad news about health problems, despite assurances of transparency. In 2003, the government initially tried to cover-up the outbreak of the SARS virus.",0
"On April 4 2019, the following warning appeared (archived here), containing the claim that marijuana smokers can detect fentanyl contamination by smell:In addition to its primary claim (that fentanyl-laced weed smells like popcorn), the post contained some secondary tacit claims: primarily that marijuana can be contaminated with fentanyl and that smoking it could be lethal.No commentary accompanied the claim to support it. An assertion in the comments matched what we encountered looking for any documented instances of fentanyl-contaminated marijuana: We were unable to locate any such incidents.In March 2018, BuzzFeed reported:[The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)]’s press office, in turn, referred to “anecdotal reports” of fentanyl in weed from police departments, specifically a 2015 Vancouver police report claiming “fentanyl-laced marijuana” was killing drug users. The following year, however, Vancouver police officers told local newscasters that they hadn’t actually seen this.… The mistaken police reports might have come from weed that tested positive for fentanyl on ultrasensitive test strips that can detect the drug at concentrations as low as one-billionth of a gram. Weed handled by dealers and people who might use all sorts of drugs will likely have trace amounts of fentanyl, similar to the way that studies have found US currency widely contaminated by cocaine. “The positive samples are from levels of contamination that are not clinically meaningful,” Ciccarone said. “They are not felt by the person.”The other evidence of cross contamination comes from toxicology tests on people who died of an overdose. That isn’t a sign of drug dealers purposefully adding fentanyl to marijuana, but rather that many drug users take all kinds of drugs.“The smoking gun,” [epidemiologist Dan] Ciccarone said, would be a positive test of a marijuana sample that contained micrograms to milligrams of fentanyl. (As little as two milligrams can be a lethal dose of fentanyl, according to the DEA.) No such record appears in the scientific literature.A search of NIDA’s archives did not return any results for incidents of fentanyl-laced marijuana. Broader searches for incidents in which marijuana was tainted with fentanyl led back to reiterations that no such contamination had ever been verified, along with reports that explicitly described reported incidents as “rumored.” In one instance, Narcan was administered to a student solely because of a rumor about fentanyl-laced marijuana:The incident is still under investigation. It is unclear what, if anything else was in the oil-based THC and it has been sent to a laboratory for testing[. ]Information about the purported olfactory properties of fentanyl largely claimed it has no discernible odor or taste, or, alternately, that it has a faint “powdery” scent. The latter claim was anecdotal, as was a description in a February 2017 article mentioning “popcorn” — the possible source of this particular rumor:Waterloo Regional Police Chief Bryan Larkin says fentanyl is a “tidal wave” hitting Ontario and the opioid is a “game changer” because it’s more deadly than crack cocaine, meth or OxyContin.In 2015, local police had 12 seizures of fentanyl. In 2016, it climbed to 69, with an additional 15 drug seizures sent to the Centre for Forensic Sciences in Toronto to determine the substances was, or contained, deadly fentanyl.Most of the seizures were in powder form, says Det. Ian Young. On the street, it’s known as china white or popcorn heroin because when fentanyl is smoked it smells like burnt popcorn, says Young, who recently spoke at a conference on opioids.That article was about fentanyl alone, not marijuana-laced fentanyl, and it was based on an anecdote from one police detective in Canada who said that fentanyl itself, not laced marijuana, smelled like popcorn when smoked. But the larger share of information about fentanyl indicated that it is primarily odorless and tasteless.Although cross-contamination of fentanyl has been reported in cocaine, the manner in which it occurred did not logically carry over to supply chains of illegal marijuana (which is not powder based):“Nobody wants to kill off their customer. Nobody’s trying to put fentanyl in their shit to get their coke customers [to switch] over to heroin when their business is coke,” [Tino Fuentes, a harm reduction and overdose reversal specialist] says, especially since there’s a chance that combination could kill them. The more likely culprit, he continues, is accidental cross-contamination.It goes like this: Dealers rush the cleanup, sloppily wiping down the area with a rag, which means traces of fentanyl remain. Then they begin to cut and package another product — in this case, cocaine — on the same table, with the same tools.A popular Facebook status update claims that fentanyl-laced weed smells like popcorn, which assumed that marijuana is necessarily laced with fentanyl at all. Multiple 2018 news articles reported that no one had unearthed a single case of fentanyl-laced marijuana, and we were unable to find any subsequent incidents of said contamination. Additionally, nearly all information about fentanyl’s scent indicated it was odorless or faintly powder-scented, not that it smells “like popcorn.” The inherent risk in such information being spread as “better safe than sorry” was lulling recreational drug users into a dangerously false sense of security with respect to detecting contamination from drugs such as fentanyl.",1
"The case stems from Medtronic’s decision to ask a judge to rule that some of its pacemakers do not infringe on technology patented by Mirowski and licensed to Boston Scientific as well as Guidant Corp, part of Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories. A court in Delaware ruled for Medtronic, saying that even though Medtronic requested the ruling, or declaratory judgment, it was up to Mirowski to prove infringement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, saying it was up to Medtronic to prove its case. The Supreme Court reversed that decision, arguing that the patent holder, in this case Mirowski, ordinarily must prove infringement and that this case was no different. “We hold that, when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee (patent holder) to establish that there is no infringement, the burden of proving infringement remains with the patentee,” the Supreme Court said in a decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer. The two patents in the case have to do with cardiac resynchronization therapy, a pacemaker that detects when the heart beats out of sync and then emits tiny shocks of electricity to correct its rhythm. It is used to treat congestive heart failure. Medtronic licensed the patents in question, but in 2007, Mirowski Family Ventures claimed Medtronic was developing new products that would also justify royalty payments. Medtronic filed suit, seeking a ruling that it did not need to pay. Wednesday’s decision means that the case will return to lower courts for further proceedings, including a fight over infringement, said Arthur Neustadt, senior partner at Oblon Spivak LLP, who argued for Mirowski at the Supreme Court. “The burden of proof issue wasn’t one of the more significant issues,” he said. “Now it goes back to Federal Circuit for other issues to be considered.”  The case is Medtronic v Boston Scientific Corp, Guidant Corp, and Mirowski Family Ventures, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-1128",0
"""(Editor’s Note: Sen. Isakson’s statement was made in the context of a discussion about two commercial nuclear power plants -- Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi and the Votgle facility, a plant near Augusta that’s slated for expansion. Isakson was specifically addressing safety issues at commercial nuclear power generators.) The fallout from Japan’s nuclear disaster has arrived in Georgia as a small cloud of worry. The construction of the nation’s first new nuclear reactors in decades is slated for just south of Augusta at the Vogtle power plant. When a deadly earthquake and tsunami triggered what is likely a partial meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a few residents near the Georgia site began to ask questions. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson was quick to offer reassurances that Vogtle would be safe. """"There has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States, even when Three Mile Island failed in the 1970s,"""" Isakson said in a YouTube.com video posted by his office. Three Mile Island? That 1979 nuclear accident sank the U.S. into a three-decade freeze on the building of nuclear power plants. No one died? Nuclear power companies have a lot at stake at Vogtle. They hope its new reactors will herald an industry renaissance. Now that Fukushima Daiichi is in crisis, the future for nuclear power is uncertain. Members of Congress, such as independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, have urged regulators to be cautious as they proceed with the construction of more nuclear plants in the U.S.  We called up Isakson’s office and asked for more evidence. A spokeswoman pointed us to 2010 testimony by Greg Jaczko, the chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at a Senate committee hearing. When a senator asked Jaczko whether a fatality had ever occurred """"as a result of an accident at a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States,"""" Jaczko replied with this:  """"There has not as a result of plant operation, not at a commercial power plant. There have been other nuclear facilities where there have been fatalities, but not in a nuclear power plant."""" We interviewed experts on Three Mile Island, epidemiology and the history of nuclear power. They agreed that no one died during the immediate crisis surrounding the Three Mile Island accident or in other commercial U.S. plants as a result of plant operation. In addition, they agreed that the scientific consensus is that in the decades following Three Mile Island, no deaths have been tied to illnesses resulting from radiation exposure. """"The statement of the politician [Isakson] is correct -- as far as we know,"""" said Sam Walker, who retired last year as historian for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is the author of a book on Three Mile Island. The prevailing view is that despite early, anecdotal reports of deaths and disease, Three Mile Island’s impact on overall cancer deaths is minimal. Worker radiation exposure was higher than normal but not extreme, and experts think people living near the plant were exposed to low doses. This does not mean, however, that the disaster has not caused deaths or won’t in the future. It can take more than a decade for radiation exposure to manifest itself as cancer, and it’s difficult to pinpoint whether radiation exposure, a smoking habit or other factors caused a particular person’s illness. The latest research suggests Three Mile Island may have some deadly long-term effects. University of Pittsburgh professor Evelyn Talbott has been leading a major, decades-long effort to track the effects of Three Mile Island radiation in more than 32,000 people who lived in the area surrounding the plant. Talbott’s team noted no increase in overall cancer deaths 20 years afterward, but research they recently submitted for publication shows that adult men who they think received the highest doses of radiation from the accident are at greater risk for leukemia than others who were exposed, the scientist said. Women with similar amounts of radiation exposure showed a higher risk of breast cancer. """"So presumably there may have been excess deaths. We just don't know who specifically, as the cases were within a group of people exposed to more radiation but also had other factors which may have predisposed them,"""" Talbott told PolitiFact Georgia. Members of an impassioned minority think the impact may have been more severe. A study by scientists at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found a link between Three Mile Island and increased incidents of cancer overall. Critics think there are too few peer-reviewed studies published in medical journals on the disaster’s health effects. Joseph Mangano, the head of the Radiation and Public Health Project, thinks the dangers of radiation exposure in general are underplayed. He noted that only a handful of studies have been published on patterns of several types of cancer. """"I think the health research field has completely dropped the ball,"""" Mangano told PolitiFact Georgia. In conclusion:  Isakson’s statement that """"there has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States, even when Three Mile Island failed in the 1970s,"""" reflects a prevailing view. According to the latest research, that does not mean there has never been a death because of Three Mile Island’s long-term effects. It’s also worth noting that some scientists back a minority view that the accident increased overall cancer deaths. That said, Isakson specified in his claim that there has never been a death """"caused by a reactor"""" in the U.S. This language is not clear, but it does indicate his claim is limited to plant operations, not the long-term aftermath of a nuclear accident. His backup information suggests this as well. We rate Isakson’s statement .""",0
"Cost is not addressed. That’s a significant oversight given that treatment with Opdivo can reach well into the tens of thousands of dollars–or more. The story clearly defines the benefit (survival without recurrence of the cancer) and offers clear numbers: “After a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared with 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. And at 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy, the findings showed.” One detail we think would have been good to add–“recurrence-free survival” doesn’t tell you how many patients are actually living longer specifically because of the treatment. It’s just telling you how much time elapses before recurrence. The story notes that the most common side effects were fatigue and diarrhea. But the story also offers information about how common any adverse side effects were — for both Opdivo and Yervoy. That’s valuable information. What’s more, the story notes that Opdivo was less likely to cause adverse side effects than Yervoy, and that those side effects were less severe. Again, that’s useful context. The story states how many patients were in the study and that it was conducted across 130 medical centers in 25 countries. The story does not note that the study was a randomized, double-blind, phase-3 trial — which would have made the story stronger. No disease mongering here. The story tells readers in the second paragraph that the study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which markets Opdivo. We like that the story places that information front and center. In addition, the story incorporates input from two independent sources. The story clearly compares the use of Opdivo to the use of Yervoy, and cites an independent source as noting that Opdivo “is superior to conventional chemotherapy for advanced metastatic disease.” The story explains: “Both Opdivo and Yervoy are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced (metastatic) melanoma. In some patients, the drugs are used in combination.” The story notes in its opening paragraph that this research “suggests that Opdivo — a drug that works with the immune system to fight melanoma — is more effective than the current standard of care for patients who’ve had surgery to remove advanced tumors.” The story goes beyond the news release associated with the research.",0
"On 10 March 2016, a nondescript WordPress blog post reporting that “autism was now disclosed and acknowledged as an adverse event reported for use of DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis) vaccine” was published by an anonymous blogger. The item primarily consisted of a sensationalist title (which suggested a new development in 2016), along with the following text and image: There’s widespread and growing lack of confidence in the safety of vaccines … Know anyone who still believes that vaccines can’t cause autism? Take a look at the DTaP vaccine insert: Predictably, it wasn’t long before the blog post began popping up in anti-vaccine circles on social media under headlines such as “FDA announces vaccines cause autism” and “Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism!”  Readers didn’t need to scan past the misleading titles to catch the thrust of the claims: The headlines insinuated that autism had recently been added to the list of known adverse affects asssociated with the DTaP, quietly confirming what science-based medical information had supposedly denied for so long. It was true that the photograph appended to that article matched the insert available for Tripedia, Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (DTaP) as shown on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s web site [PDF]: Also true was the fact that visible selective emphasis highlighted information favorable to anti-vaxxers while failing to include crucial context (namely that the listed effect was a post-approval, unverified user-reported one that does not “establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine”): We contacted UC Hastings law professor and immunization law expert Dorit Rubenstein Reiss about the claim, who directed us to a related passage in the Tripedia insert. While the blog highlighted Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) alongside autism as reported adverse effects, directly beneath the referenced passage was information that the rate of SIDS was lower among vaccinated infants than among unvaccinated ones: In the German case-control study and US open-label safety study in which 14,971 infants received Tripedia vaccine, 13 deaths in Tripedia vaccine recipients were reported. Causes of deaths included seven SIDS, and one of each of the following: enteritis, Leigh Syndrome, adrenogenital syndrome, cardiac arrest, motor vehicle accident, and accidental drowning. All of these events occurred more than two weeks post immunization. The rate of SIDS observed in the German case-control study was 0.4/1,000 vaccinated infants. The rate of SIDS observed in the US open-label safety study was 0.8/1,000 vaccinated infants and the reported rate of SIDS in the US from 1985-1991 was 1.5/1,000 live births. By chance alone, some cases of SIDS can be expected to follow receipt of whole-cell pertussis DTP35 or DTaP vaccines. Another aspect of the vaccine excerpt reproduced above was that automobile accidents and drownings were included among the causes of reported deaths that occurred after vaccination, which underscores that the nature of such statistics is an inclusive one encompassing adverse events which clearly have no causal relationship with vaccine. Reiss also pointed us to the FDA’s guidance on adverse event-related drug labeling [PDF], which states: The ADVERSE REACTIONS section must list adverse reactions identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials and must also be preceded by information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions. To help practitioners interpret the significance of data obtained from postmarketing spontaneous reports, the following statement, or an appropriate modification, should precede these data: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of drug X. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. When we asked Reiss whether adverse event labeling included all documented reports whether or not they were linked to the drug in question, she confirmed that “the insert lists events reported even if causation evidence is sketchy. It actually says so.” Those who read down to the bottom of the eleven-page Tripedia/DTaP insert might have noticed another relevant portion: The insert information was labeled current “as of December 2005,” which first would mean its sudden “discovery” by an anonymous blogger over a decade later was of questionable (if not negligible) import. But the age of the documentation was important for a second reason: the prominent medical journal The Lancet didn’t formally retract a controversial 1998 research paper which falsely advanced the belief that vaccines were linked to autism until February 2010. While that retraction was significant and definitive, twelve years passed between the paper’s publication and The Lancet‘s disavowal of it: A prominent British medical journal retracted a 1998 research paper that set off a sharp decline in vaccinations in Britain after the paper’s lead author suggested that vaccines could cause autism. The retraction by The Lancet is part of a reassessment that has lasted for years of the scientific methods and financial conflicts of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who contended that his research showed that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine may be unsafe. Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the retraction of Dr. Wakefield’s study “significant.” “It builds on the overwhelming body of research by the world’s leading scientists that concludes there is no link between M.M.R. vaccine and autism,” Mr. Skinner wrote. A British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had been dishonest, violated basic research ethics rules and showed a “callous disregard” for the suffering of children involved in his research. Dr. Wakefield’s paper reported on his examinations of 12 children with chronic intestinal disorders who had a history of normal development followed by severe mental regressions. But an investigation by a British journalist found financial and scientific conflicts that Dr. Wakefield did not reveal in his paper. For instance, part of the costs of Dr. Wakefield’s research were paid by lawyers for parents seeking to sue vaccine makers for damages. Dr. Wakefield was also found to have patented in 1997 a measles vaccine that would succeed if the combined vaccine were withdrawn or discredited. A 2 February 2010 article published in the British Medical Journal explained how the process of gathering accurate information to counter Wakefield’s claims took years: An academic journal is not a collection of blank pages on to which authors inscribe important scientific facts as they discover them. Rather, science is made and shaped as authors consider the declared areas of interest, impact factors, and instructions for authors of candidate journals for their work and as the papers they submit clear the successive hurdles of eligibility screening, selection of peer reviewers, responding to reviewers’ comments, statistical approval, technical editing, and distribution of press releases. A graph showing first a precipitous fall in immunisation rates in the United Kingdom and then a corresponding rise in the incidence of measles was later reproduced in the broadsheets (and in at least one GCSE biology syllabus) as an iconic symbol of bad science. That article also alluded to the immediate and lasting effects of the initial publication of Wakefield’s now-discredited research: Once the article appeared with the Lancet kitemark — cautious accompanying editorial notwithstanding — the arguments were considered by many to be proved, and the ghastly social drama of the demon vaccine took on a life of its own. An April 2011 article in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry summarized in a timeline the havoc wreaked by Wakefield’s 1998 paper, noting that a “journalistic investigation, rather than academic vigilance” led to the long-awaited retraction: In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and 12 of his colleagues published a case series in the Lancet, which suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may predispose to behavioral regression and pervasive developmental disorder in children. Despite the small sample size (n=12), the uncontrolled design, and the speculative nature of the conclusions, the paper received wide publicity, and MMR vaccination rates began to drop because parents were concerned about the risk of autism after vaccination. Almost immediately afterward, epidemiological studies were conducted and published, refuting the posited link between MMR vaccination and autism. The logic that the MMR vaccine may trigger autism was also questioned because a temporal link between the two is almost predestined: both events, by design (MMR vaccine) or definition (autism), occur in early childhood. The next episode in the saga was a short retraction of the interpretation of the original data by 10 of the 12 co-authors of the paper. According to the retraction, “no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient”. This was accompanied by an admission by the Lancet that Wakefield et al. had failed to disclose financial interests (e.g., Wakefield had been funded by lawyers who had been engaged by parents in lawsuits against vaccine-producing companies). However, the Lancet exonerated Wakefield and his colleagues from charges of ethical violations and scientific misconduct. The Lancet completely retracted the Wakefield et al. paper in February 2010, admitting that several elements in the paper were incorrect, contrary to the findings of the earlier investigation. Wakefield et al. were held guilty of ethical violations (they had conducted invasive investigations on the children without obtaining the necessary ethical clearances) and scientific misrepresentation (they reported that their sampling was consecutive when, in fact, it was selective). This retraction was published as a small, anonymous paragraph in the journal, on behalf of the editors. The final episode in the saga is the revelation that Wakefield et al. were guilty of deliberate fraud (they picked and chose data that suited their case; they falsified facts). The British Medical Journal has published a series of articles on the exposure of the fraud, which appears to have taken place for financial gain. It is a matter of concern that the exposé was a result of journalistic investigation, rather than academic vigilance followed by the institution of corrective measures. Readers may be interested to learn that the journalist on the Wakefield case, Brian Deer, had earlier reported on the false implication of thiomersal (in vaccines) in the etiology of autism. However, Deer had not played an investigative role in that report. So while it was true autism was listed among the reported adverse events in the Tripedia/DTaP vaccine’s insert, that same insert explained that all adverse events were listed, regardless of evidence of causation. Furthermore, the insert was current as of 2005, and was therefore hardly a novel finding in 2016. Five years after the Tripedia insert was printed, The Lancet formally retracted the 1998 paper to which fears about vaccines and autism were largely attributed, but by that point, the advancement of that idea had already left a palpable mark on public health in both the United States and in the UK.",1
"Story says it costs $3-5 a bottle The story makes clear that there is no evidence to prove benefits. Nice job on this. Excerpt: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report in April 1995 that linked homebrewed kombucha with the illness of two women who were hospitalized with severe acidosis. One woman died of cardiac arrest and the other was revived after her heart stopped. The story is quite clear on this:  there is no evidence. Excerpt: “To date, there hasn’t been a single human trial reported in a major medical journal,” he said. “This doesn’t mean that kombucha tea can’t possibly have health benefits, it just means that at this time, there’s no direct evidence that it provides the benefits it’s reported to have.” No disease mongering in the story. Good input from expert sources providing necessary skepticism. Story provides appropriate perspective: The widespread availability and growing popularity of this product is clear. Again, good context. Excerpt: This was clearly an enterprise story.",0
"In March 2019, images of a plant dubbed a “penis flytrap” — a play on words that evokes the comparatively less phallic Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) — went viral. These posts all described the plant as belonging to the Nepenthes genus:  Though the provenance of the image shown above is uncertain, we have no reason to doubt this is an authentic photograph of a plant that belonging to the Nepenthes genus. We emailed Clinton Morse, the living plant collections manager at the University of Connecticut’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, to ask about the photograph, and he told us: It is certainly a Nepenthes species and certainly looks like an authentic image. … All Nepenthes have a similar passive pitfall trap that develops with a closed trap, and as the trap matures the ‘lid’ opens up. The pitchers in the attached image are just starting to open thus giving them a rather penile appearance. I’ve never heard of them being called “penis fly trap,” but it is a rather accurate descriptive name. Indeed, once the pit trap is fully matured and the lid is opened, the plant becomes a bit less penile-looking. The open trap fills with water and is designed to attract insects who then fall into the water, where the plant scavenges the nutrients in the decaying bodies, as described in a 1999 review of the genus’ carnivorous behavior: Plants of this genus utilize a passive method of attraction and entrapment to capture and digest their insect quarry. The lip of the pitcher, a ridged double edged collar called the peristome, is characterized by the presence of nectaries that attract insects to the pitcher opening. A lining of several layers of epicuticular wax on the upper region of the pitcher causes the insects to lose their footing while foraging and to slip down the steep walls of the pitcher into its base where they are trapped in a fluid.",0
"Q: Was the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade made because Jane Roe said she was raped? A: No. “Jane Roe” falsely claimed she was gang raped, but that accusation was not a factor in the court ruling. A viral video is circulating online framed by text that says: “Did you know Roe v. Wade was passed only because Roe lied about being raped?” That’s not true.Rape played no part in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, the case that made access to abortion legal across the country. Rather, the court ruled, in a 7-2 opinion, that women had a constitutional right to abortion under the 14th Amendment’s right to privacy.In fact, the court’s decision didn’t mention the circumstances that led to the plaintiff’s pregnancy at all. It just said: “Roe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion ‘performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions’; that she was unable to get a ‘legal’ abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions.”The woman who brought the case in 1970 under the pseudonym Jane Roe was Norma McCorvey, who had been living in Dallas County, Texas. It is true that in seeking an abortion in Texas she had initially claimed to have been gang raped and then, in a 1987 interview, McCorvey said that she had lied about the rape.“I found out I was pregnant through what I thought was love,” McCorvey said during the interview with journalist Carl Rowan in a documentary series called “Searching For Justice: Three American Stories.” McCorvey had hoped that by claiming she was raped, she’d be able to get around the Texas ban on abortion, which included an exception if the mother’s life were in danger, according to an interview with Rowan by the New York Times in 1987.But McCorvey never ended up getting an abortion. Her baby was born before the Supreme Court’s decision came down, and she gave up the child for adoption, according to testimony she gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2005.One of the lawyers who represented McCorvey at the Supreme Court, Sarah Weddington, said in a statement shortly before the 1987 documentary aired that during the case she never “touched the issue of rape and only emphasized the question of whether the Constitution gives to the state or leaves to a woman the questions of what she can or must do with her body.”So, while it’s true that McCorvey had first claimed to have been raped and later recanted, it is not true that the claim had any bearing on the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade.Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.Robichaud, Paul.

"The cost of breast surgery in the US varies widely depending on the type, hospital and region, and so we acknowledge that it would have been difficult to provide solid numbers here. Nevertheless, we feel that cost remains relevant for this piece. This study basically argues that surgery plus other aggressive non-surgical treatment vs. non-surgical treatment alone may lead to longer survival. Since this isn’t proven, one could reasonably ask about the costs of these two approaches. This may be analogous to the prior use of autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in women with metastatic breast cancer. The high cost of this treatment led to fights with insurers over coverage and finally to a randomized trial that showed no benefit. We don’t do autologous BMT anymore. Could a similar scenario play out here? The question seems worth asking and addressing. The Washington Post story quantifies the potential benefits of surgery, detailing that women who underwent breast surgery had better survival rates than those that didn’t (median of 28 months versus 19 months). Despite the better outcomes, the article adds the number of surgeries dropped from 67.8 percent in 1998 to 25.1 percent in 2011, which it describes as an “intriguing question” about that approach. Furthermore, the story is quick to point out early in the story that surgery may not be the right option for all women and “may be better for some women than it was in 1995.” We applaud the fact that the benefits are reported in absolute terms and in a more cautionary manner, which is why we give it a Satisfactory rating here. Breast surgery can lead to complications, such as bleeding and infection, like any major surgery. Patients usually choose between breast-sparing surgery (surgery that takes out the cancer and leaves most of the breast) and a mastectomy (surgery that removes the whole breast). According to cancer.gov, mastectomies can affect a woman’s psychological well-being due to a change in body image and the loss of normal breast functions. Furthermore, women undergoing total mastectomies lose nipple sensation, which may impede sexual arousal. Other breast surgeries could lead to sudden drops in estrogen production, which could induce early menopause in premenopausal women. Since harms are not addressed, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The evaluation of evidence was excellent in this Washington Post story, as it pointed out the limitations to the study and described other studies that had not reported the same results. For example, the story explains the limitations of retrospective data, which look back on patients’ treatments. Since the motivations behind therapy decisions are unknown, the conclusions could be rendered unreliable for clinical decision-making, the article says. Another limitation was the over-representation of Africa-American women in the study. It also details two prospective studies that found no survival difference among women with stage 4 breast cancer. One limitation that was overlooked, however, was that usually younger women underwent surgery, which may have also confounded the results. And according to the original research report, age (younger than 45 years) was an independent predictor of prolonged survival. The story also describes and quantifies the research, mentioning the study looked at 21,372 women with stage 4 breast cancer from 1988 to 2011. Lastly, we applaud the story’s use of cautionary language. The report doesn’t jump to premature conclusions or make recommendations based on this one JAMA Surgery study, One of the sources says, “It’s premature to suggest… that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of stage 4 disease.” The article does not engage in disease mongering, although it could have been helpful to learn more about the prevalence of breast cancer in the US. The Washington Post report interviews two independent sources – the chief surgical oncologist at the University of Michigan and the medical director of a breast cancer center – and their comments bring a much needed critical perspective to the piece. No conflicts of interests are reported, both in the original research article and in the Washington Post story. The article hints at “more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques” that have developed over time, but it doesn’t explicit state what those are. We would have liked to have seen a sentence or two describing some existing breast cancer treatments, in the case the patient chooses not to opt for surgery. However, since the story mentions radiation as a possible therapy, we give it a Satisfactory rating here. The availability of risk-reducing  breast surgery is not in question, since it is not a new intervention. The article makes it clear that surgery is not a new intervention to treat breast cancer, stating that women and their clinicians have opted for surgery since at least 1988. The story doesn’t seem to be based on news releases we found online. The Washington Post article shows evidence of original reporting – shown by the comments from the two independent sources and two study authors – and also cites the JAMA Surgery paper.",0
"The story says these treatments could cost “anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year.” The story didn’t provide any sense of the scope of potential benefits seen in the trials so far. The story says only that “one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with almost no noticeable side effects.” Is this to suggest that everyone in the trials is getting relief for up to three months from one injection? It’s not clear. Initially the story says patients “report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain.” But it also notes a lack of long-term safety data and “potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function” as well as potential effects on fertility or placental function. In the end, the reporter reflects on her own migraines and her own choices: “I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in ten years I’ll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.” We also like this cautionary sentence: “Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.” The story doesn’t give much data on the evidence backing these new treatments, except to say that the longest patients have been on them is “one to two years.” What type of trials have been conducted? How many patients were involved, and how severe or frequent were their headaches? How did the treatments stack up against placebos? Those are just some of the questions that would have been useful to explore. (And if the drug companies aren’t making this information public, that should be clear, too.) No disease mongering here. The story reports federal data that about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. reported having a migraine in the last three months, and as many as 2 percent of Americans have at least 15 migraine days every month. “The toll such pain can take on health, morale, and productivity is substantial,” it says. Two physicians who don’t appear to have interests in promoting these treatments are quoted. The story gives plenty of details: A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant. The writer also describes her own quest for relief: Since that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn’t enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month. The story makes it clear these injections aren’t available yet: Two manufacturers, Amgen (in collaboration with Novartis) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and expect to hear from the FDA by June whether the therapies have been approved. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year. It also cautions that their high cost means insurance companies might “require patients to have tried just about everything else first.” The lead states “there isn’t a drug on the market today that prevents (migraines) by targeting the underlying cause.” This story doesn’t rely on a news release.",0
"""The story mentions the cost of the device. The story provides some quantification of benefits of the device but leaves many questions unanswered. The story states that 80% of the patients experienced at least a 50% improvement in symptoms with the device. Compared to how many with conventional treatment? What does an """"improvement"""" mean? In what symptoms? How was improvement measured? The story mentions re-operation due to infection and pain, mechanical failures and discomfort as harms of the implanted device. The story refers to a review that found 4 randomized, controlled trials of the device. The story could have provided more detail about the strength of these studies and pointed out the limitations on the current evidence, such as the small sample sizes, limited follow up time and the fact that many of the studies were industry sponsored. The story does not engage in disease mongering. The story quotes multiple experts. The story points out that one of the experts is a researcher on a Medtronic-sponsored trial of the device but does not mention any conflicts for the other experts, leaving the reader questioning the validity of some of their statements. The story mentions exercises, biofeedback and medications as alternatives to the device, and is careful to point out that these should be considered first-line treatment options before the device is considered. The story could have done more to describe the pros and cons of the alternatives. Clearly the device is available, but it is not clear how widely and how many practitioners are trained in implanting the device. The story accurately represents the novelty of the device. Because the story quoted many experts, the reader can assume the story did not rely on a press release as the sole source of information.""",0
"On 5 May 2018, the University of Würzburg in Germany held an event with the theme of “Future Societys” [sic] that featured Mirjam Heine, a medical student who gave what would become a controversial presentation on the subject of “Why our perception of pedophilia has to change.” In her talk, Heine told the story of a 19-year-old Jonas, a Munich law student who is sexually attracted to girls aged six to 12 years old. “But since he’s aware of the consequences for the children, he has never given in to his sexual drive.” She cited the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 10) for the description of pedophilia as the “sexual preference for preadolescent children” and pointed to unspecified research that differentiates between child sexual abusers and pedophiles. Heine’s most controversial comments rocketed across the Internet when websites ran reports of them under headlines such as “TEDx Speaker: Pedophilia Is an Unchangeable Orientation,” which led some viewers to believe Heine had condoned “an illegal and harmful practice.”  Although Heine did make a comment about pedophilia’s being an “unchangeable sexual orientation,” it was offered in a fuller context which we’ve transcribed here: Let me very clear here. Abusing children is wrong without any doubt. But a pedophile who doesn’t abuse children has done nothing wrong. I want to quickly summarize where we are at the moment. According to current research, pedophilia is an unchangeable sexual orientation, just like for example heterosexuality. No one chooses to be a pedophile. No one can cease being one. The difference between pedophilia and other sexual orientations is that living out this sexual orientation will end in a disaster. Pedophilia is not defined by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) as a sexual orientation: it is classified as a disorder in the fifth and most current revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). Discussions that attempt to equate pedophilia with sexual orientation have been contentious, primarily because of the false belief that members of the LGBT community are predisposed to child molestation. Those who argue against civil rights for the LGBT community often cast those rights as a slippery slope to legalizing child sexual abuse or bestiality. TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) did not deny the controversial talk took place, but they noted in a 20 June 2018 statement that TEDx talks are “are organized independently from the main annual TED conference” and that the video had been removed at Heine’s request because “she had serious concerns about her own safety in its wake” and Heine cited “research in ways that are open to serious misinterpretation”: In the TEDx talk, a speaker described pedophilia as a condition some people are born with, and suggested that if we recognize it as such, we can do more to prevent those people from acting on their instincts. TEDx events are organized independently from the main annual TED conference, with some 3,500 events held every year in more than 100 countries. Our nonprofit TED organization does not control TEDx events’ content. This talk and its removal was recently brought to our attention. After reviewing the talk, we believe it cites research in ways that are open to serious misinterpretation. This led some viewers to interpret the talk as an argument in favor of an illegal and harmful practice. Furthermore, after contacting the organizer to understand why it had been taken down, we learned that the speaker herself requested it be removed from the internet because she had serious concerns about her own safety in its wake. Our policy is and always has been to remove speakers’ talks when they request we do so. That is why we support this TEDx organizer’s decision to respect this speaker’s wishes and keep the talk offline.",0
"""The image that showed up the PolitiFact Georgia inbox had already pinged wildly around social media. The top part showed the Pope waving from the back seat of the small four-door Fiat 500L. Below it was a photo of a driver purported to be College Park megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar, tooling in a shiny silver roadster with an EU license plate. The reader wondered, could that actually be the lead pastor of World Changers Church International behind those sunglasses, zipping along somewhere in Europe? We wondered too, and decided to do some digging. Breaking down the rides That the top part of the meme was accurate was clear from news coverage, and the social media response, during Pope Francis’ recent visit to the United States. The Pope made news for what he said but also for his use of the Italian-made subcompact car. News reports said Vatican police, not the Holy See, selected the car, which has a starting list price of $19,935. But they did so on Francis’ specific request of modesty and simplicity for his ride. Determining who was behind the wheel in the roadster proved more of a challenge. Dollar is a recognizable face who has made his own headlines, most recently from a fundraising video to help his ministry buy a $65 million Gulfstream G650 luxury jet. Though the church removed the video after a backlash, the church’s board of directors later said it still intended to replace Dollar’s jet with the Holy Grail of luxury jets. """"We plan to acquire a Gulfstream G650 because it is the best, and it is a reflection of the level of excellence at which this organization chooses to operate,"""" the directors said in a prepared statement. So, the idea of Dollar photographed in a sports car didn’t seem all that outlandish. But with the shades covering much of the driver’s face, it was hard to tell just who was behind the wheel. Focusing on the car, though, brought the navigator into much clearer view. We sent the image to Jim Donnelly and Tom Comerro, the senior editor and editorial assistant, respectively at Hemmings Motor News. The official word from the bible for car collectors: the silver roadster is a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Stirling Moss edition. Only 75 of the vehicles were produced, with a starting list price in 2009 of 750,000 Euros, or north of $1 million for a supercharged ride that could reach 217 miles per hour with no windshield. Searching for who has access to that ride led us to a similar picture, of a different angle and a driver with the sunglasses off. That’s not a reverend driving the $1 million car. The driver is rapper Kanye West, whose nickname Yeezus is a clear play on the name for the son of God, arriving at a gala in Cannes, France. (You can see a more clear photo of Kanye as the driver here). Modesty and prosperity Simply put, the image itself is flat-out wrong. And what about the context of those 1,000 words the picture is trying to say? Much has been made of the """"simplicity"""" sought by Pope Francis ever since he took a vow of poverty as a Jesuit priest. He took the subway as a cardinal in Argentina and news reports say he humbles himself in either a Ford Focus or a 1984 Renault when getting around the Vatican. Dollar, meanwhile, is well-known for preaching the """"prosperity gospel,"""" which says that God wants all believers to do well in all aspects of their lives, including finances. Dollar listed two Rolls Royces – one paid for by his congregation and another by members of his ministerial association of those pastors he has trained – in a 2007 congressional inquiry into the tax-exempt status of a handful of such megachurches. World Changers spokesman Vic Bolton said Dollar no longer uses those $250,000 automobiles and instead drivers a regular Mercedes Benz S-Class sedan (which new lists for $96,000) that’s about 8-10 years old (in the $65,000 range). """"It’s a nice car, but it’s no Aston Martin,"""" Bolton said. """"I don’t think he drives a Mercedes to send a message. He drives a nice car because that’s what he wants. True prosperity is having options."""" The same could be said about Pope Francis. The Catholic Church, too, is mum about its wealth. But a 2014 report found hundreds of millions of Euros tucked away, off the official church balance sheet. And the Vatican bank manages $7.3 billion in assets and keeps $20 million in gold reserves in the U.S. Federal Reserve. That is enough to buy and sell more than a few of those fancy roadsters. So the real difference – beyond the scale of wealth – is between the ideologies of those Christian faiths, said Kate Bowler, a professor of American Christianity at Duke Divinity School in North Carolina. The Catholic Church is heavily collective, with a focus on the church’s responsibility as a group. In the prosperity gospel, responsibility falls entirely to the right-believing individual. Often, the proof of that belief shows up in flashy cars or extravagant churches, such as the 8,500-seat World Changers dome that has become a landmark in College Park. But Bowler said the faith encourages family connections and community connections as truly prosperous, as well as focusing on sharing the gospel so that others may find that success. """"It doesn’t really matter if it’s not true,"""" Bowler said of the meme, """"because it does capture the essence of a faith that requires proof of wealth to be true."""" That means Kanye West being confused for Creflo Dollar adds to, not diminishes, his message, she added. """"I don’t think Creflo would mind at all,"""" she said. """"He’s a victor and that language of triumph and the wealthy car demonstrates to believers that God is with them."""" Our ruling A viral image making its way around social media purports to show Pope Francis getting around town in a small compact sedan, while Georgia’s megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar zips along in a stylish two-seater sports car. The roadster driver is actually rapper Kanye West, making the image clearly false. Even the context – trying to draw distinction between a supposedly humble servant of God with an apparently audacious one – ignores that both the Pope and Dollar have ready access to lavish luxuries.""",1
"While it could be argued that the work on this combination laser-ultrasound device is at too early a stage to demand a comparison to the cost of existing laser devices, a quote in the release claims, “we’re hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future,” which implies the developers must have some sense of how much their device might cost when they achieve their stated goal of commercialization. The release contains only vague claims about the technique being “extremely beneficial” and “safer, more controllable.” In fact, the researchers did not test either safety or clinical effectiveness in the experiment highlighted in the release, so it is premature to make claims of benefits. The release refers to “safety concerns” of existing laser devices, including eye damage, but there are no details about the level of risk presented by this new device. Oddly, the abstract of the conference presentation and the upcoming journal article in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine that were mentioned in the release both highlighted concerns about discoloring or burning skin, something not mentioned at all in the release. Note: The conference abstract was behind a paywall which requires a journal subscription. A draft of the accepted journal article was provided upon request, but we urge those who send out news releases to automatically include primary source material. The release says the researchers tested their device on “porcine skin tissue samples” and claims they saw promising initial results. However, the only result reported in the conference abstract and draft journal article is an increase in the amount of light that went through the pig skin in the lab, which the authors said “implies” reduced back-scatter or absorption in the skin. No results were reported about eye damage risk or skin heating, discoloration or burning. There was no mention in the conference abstract or journal article of any test tattoos or other skin marks on the pig skin, so there is no data presented about the actual ability of the device to remove the “birthmarks, port-wine stains, tattoos” headlining the release. The release doesn’t engage in disease mongering. It includes some context about how the new technology works. It seems clear from the release that this device is intended to be used on the same sort of patients who currently receive laser treatments to remove tattoos or other skin markings. We applaud the inclusion of a link to a patent application, which both highlights a potential benefit to the researchers and provides a great deal more detail about the device itself. The application states that the patent has been assigned to the University of Missouri, but it is reasonable to assume that commercialization of this device would benefit the careers of the researchers. The release says the research was funded by a University of Missouri program called FastTrack, which is intended to support the development and commercialization of technologies. Although the release does include claims that this experimental device is better than existing dermatological lasers, there are no details about how, or how much, better it might be. What’s more, the release fails to mention other methods, including applying glycerol or mechanical vibration to improve laser light transmission through skin. The draft journal article cites other research into using ultrasound, but this somewhat similar technique was not mentioned in the news release. The confusing mishmash of references to “open-air transmission” and sonoillumination is not useful to readers who don’t dig into the conference or patent application materials. Although the release is clear that the device is not yet available, there is no support for the claim that the device, which has yet to be tested on tattoos or other skin markings, “will be available widely in the near future,” especially since clinical trials have yet to be performed. The release mentions that lasers have been used to treat skin conditions for decades. However, it fails to note that other researchers have been looking into using ultrasound to improve laser light transmission for a number of years. Judging the release on this criterion is made harder by the muddled references to two distinct attributes of the device. The second paragraph of the release refers to reducing open-air transmission of laser light, and thus the risk of eye damage. But that statement is immediately followed by a quote about “sonoillumination.” This distinct component of the device uses ultrasound in an attempt to help the laser light pass through skin without heating it as much as conventional lasers, but that feature is explained only in the conference abstract and draft journal article. This burn risk, and how ultrasound might reduce it, is not mentioned in the release, which makes it very difficult for readers to understand just what is new about this device. The release is peppered with claims and quotes that are not supported by evidence. The headline claims that removal of birthmarks, port-wine stains and tattoos could be “revolutionized,” but the experiment did not include any testing of effectiveness on such skin markings. Claims of improved safety are also not supported by any data. Again, the experiment mentioned in the release, which was presented at a recent conference, reported results only on the optical transmission properties of pig skin samples; nothing about safety or clinical effectiveness.",1
"The use of cannabis and other drugs is already legal in Uruguay, one of Latin America’s safest countries and a trailblazer on liberal lawmaking, but the sale and cultivation of drugs is not. President Jose Mujica, a former leftist guerrilla fighter, says the proposed law will help undermine smuggling gangs and fight petty crime in a region hit by drugs-related violence. Critics say it risks luring more Uruguayans to harder drugs. “The idea is to grant licenses for production, distribution, storage and for retail. We haven’t said whether that will be done by the private or public sector, the government will decide that,” said Sebastian Sabini, a ruling party lawmaker who heads a congressional committee on drugs and addiction. The bill, which the government hopes will become law early next year, says the state will be responsible for managing and regulating the marijuana trade from cultivation to distribution. Mujica’s allies control both houses of Congress so the bill is expected to pass despite resistance from opposition legislators. It would give Uruguay some of the world’s most permissive legislation on drugs. Households will be allowed to have up to six plants, or as much as 480 grams (about 17 ounces) of marijuana, the bill presented for discussion by the congressional committee showed. Cannabis consumers would be allowed to buy a maximum 40 grams each month under the bill, which also sets out regulations for smoking clubs with up to 15 members, 90 plants and annual production of up to 7.2 kilograms (15.8 pounds). A National Cannabis Institute would be created to control the drug’s production and distribution, impose sanctions on rule-breakers and design educational policies to warn about the risks of marijuana consumption. Some opponents have warned that Uruguay risks riling governments battling drug-related violence in the region, such as Colombia and Mexico, as well as the United States. President Barack Obama said earlier this year that legalizing drugs would not do away with violent cartels and “could be just as corrupting, if not more corrupting than the status quo.”",0
"Oddly, the release includes a quote from the study’s leader about how “the cost savings of such an approach could … be significant” — yet treatment cost estimates are completely absent in the release. Cost deserved more than the nod given in this release. The release mentions the treatment will be a “Gleevec-like” drug so it’s notable that the costs may also be “Gleevec-like” to start. A 2016 Washington Post article noted that the wholesale cost of Gleevec had risen from $26,400 to $120,000 annually over the 15 years it has been on the market. Even with insurance, a patient might have paid $500-$800 month out-of-pocket for the drug, the Washington Post found. The introduction of generics after the patent on Gleevec expires this year will bring the cost down dramatically. In the chronic phase of the disease, where remission isn’t likely, the average cost for brand-name imatinib per year is $79,000 a year, or $92,000 by a more recent estimate. A large group of physicians wrote in a 2013 cost analysis study in the journal Blood: “We believe the unsustainable drug prices in CML and cancer may be causing harm to patients.” Fortunately, a generic drug should cost $46,000 a year as Gleevec loses patent exclusivity in 2016, according to a recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. But that’s just imatinib. Although the release mentions an Epizyme-made Ezh2 inhibitor drug in an unrelated Phase 1 clinical trial, it doesn’t name it. The release makes clear that its discovery of a potential weak point in a frustrating form of leukemia has the potential to push CML patients into remission. But it doesn’t quantify those results in any way. Even more importantly, the release drags its feet when disclosing that the research was performed in animal subjects. It remains to be seen if the treatment would have similar benefits for people. And that result could be many years down the road. Side effects are mentioned for imatinib, but never detailed. And this is a major oversight that would have benefited the crux of the release (i.e. a need for alternatives to imatinib-like drugs). One 2010 study assessed a flotilla of side effects, including muscle cramps, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, abdominal pain, joint pain, and more in greater than 10% of patients who take it for CML. But it also notes a rare few can be “sinister” in less than 1% of patients: heart damage, kidney failure, muscle degeneration, secondary cancers, and even cerebellar edema, which can cause fainting, seizures, and even put someone into a coma. The side-effects of Ezh2 inhibitors also aren’t noted since it seems the most promising one is still in clinical trials. Since the new drug hasn’t been tested in humans there is really no way to gauge side effects but all cancer drugs have them, often very serious ones as noted above. We’re told that when gene-editing techniques turned off Ezh2 in mice with CML, it prevented their leukemia cells from progressing, “halting the disease at its source.” But it’s one thing to go from a genetically engineered mouse to a human patient, let alone targeting that person’s disease with a fairly experimental drug. There are so many studies in mice that don’t pan out in humans. This release appears to be putting the cart before the horse. We don’t see anything that would scare a reader. We’re told the pharmaceutical company Epizyme opened a phase 1 clinical trial at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s hospital. We’re also told an NIH grant and Hyundai Hope on Wheels is funding the study. The release also notes one of the authors on the study is an employee of Novartis Pharmaceuticals — which owns the (soon-to-expire) patent for Gleevec, also called Glivec. Aside from the current standard of care — imatinib-like drugs — the release only vaguely references “second- and third-line targeted therapies” that “can often return the disease to remission,” yet doesn’t name them. The release notes imatinib-like drugs are the standard of care for CML patients, implying a diagnosis would grant access to the drugs by prescription. Though it doesn’t name the potential Ezh2 inhibitor drug, the release does note it’s part of a Phase 1 trial, as well as other clinical trials — implying it’s not readily available. A lack of absolute clarity here isn’t helpful to readers, but there’s enough to mark this satisfactory. A statement that clarified that it would likely be years before testing in humans would be complete would have been appropriate here. The release does a decent job of teeing up the connection between the leukemia cells that drive CML and a biological pathway that an existing drug might be able to target. The repeated use of the term “cure” — including in the headline — when only preliminary animal data is being presented — is unjustifiable.",1
"In January 2008, Japan passed the “Metabo Law” in an effort to curb obesity in that country. While the law does require men and women between the ages of 45 and 74 to have their waistlines examined once a year and potentially seek medical treatment if their measurements fall outside established ranges, it did not establish obesity as a criminal offense. The Metabo Law was named after metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions, including high blood pressure and excess body fat, that can increase the risk of serious medical ailments:  Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions — increased blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol levels — that occur together, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Having just one of these conditions doesn’t mean you have metabolic syndrome. However, any of these conditions increase your risk of serious disease. If more than one of these conditions occur in combination, your risk is even greater. If you have metabolic syndrome or any of the components of metabolic syndrome, aggressive lifestyle changes can delay or even prevent the development of serious health problems. The New York Times reported in 2008 the Metabo Law affects men with waistlines larger than 35.4 inches and women with waistlines larger than 31.5 inches. People exceeding these governmental limits, which are identical to the measurements established by the International Diabetes Federation in 2006, may be required to go to counseling sessions or converse with a health expert about dietary options. Unlike individuals, however, companies and local governments can be assessed financial penalties if the citizens in their charge do not meet government standards:  To reach its goals of shrinking the overweight population by 10 percentover the next four years and 25 percent over the next seven years, the government will impose financial penalties on companies and local governments that fail to meet specific targets. The country’s Ministry of Health argues that the campaign will keep the spread of diseases like diabetes and strokes in check. The ministry also says that curbing widening waistlines will rein in a rapidly aging society’s ballooning health care costs, one of the most serious and politically delicate problems facing Japan today. Opponents of the Metabo Law maintain the weight guidelines are too strict. Japan is one of the least obese developed nations in the world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and Yoichi Ogushi, professor at Tokai University’s School of Medicine, has argued the law will not have much of an effect on the health of Japan’s citizens:  “I don’t think the campaign will have any positive effect. Now if you did this in the United States, there would be benefits, since there are many Americans who weigh more than 100 kilograms [220 pounds]. But the Japanese are so slender that they can’t afford to lose weight.”",1
"Although the story does not discuss costs, the price of aspirin is low and well-known. Yet it would be helpful for stories about population-wide recommendations to address total costs, even if the price for individuals seems low. Broader use of aspirin would also inevitably lead to an increase in the costs of treating bleeding ulcers and other adverse events and they should be acknowledged, even if there might be offsetting reductions in other treatment expenses. Like many other reports, this story relied exclusively on relative risk reduction. Overall the study noted a 3% incidence of cancer in participants who did not receive aspirin and a 2.3% incidence for those who took aspirin. Yes, that is a 23% reduction overall but a 0.7% absolute reduction. Put another way, if indeed aspirin is preventive, you would need to treat 150 people to prevent one occurence of cancer. That benefit needs to be put into context because aspirin is not without its side effects. Nevertheless, we are rating this as satisfactory despite the use of relative risk based, because it did not trumpet the relative risk reductions and emphasized the uncertainties and limitations of the study results. In contrast to some other stories we reviewed, from the lead sentence through the body of the story, it is clear that aspirin increases the risk of bleeding ulcers and other bleeding problems. The story includes a description of the key features of the study, noting that the researchers re-analyzed data from several experiments that compared the heart disease outcomes of people randomly assigned to take aspirin daily to those who were given placebo pills, and that the researchers then added in data from death records in order to asses long-term cancer death rates. The story highlights concerns about relying on data gathered to look at one health threat (heart disease) in order to draw conclusions about a completely different health threat (cancer). It is difficult to mention cancer and not fall victim to disease mongering. Few other disease provide a similar emotional response. The story highlights questions about who might receive some cancer-reduction benefit, noting that the data used for this study included very few women and that since the underlying trials were designed to look for heart disease effects and not cancer, there may be things about the participants that would affect the results, but weren’t recorded during the original trials. These caveats help make clear that there are still uncertainties about who exactly might benefit. The story includes comments from several independent sources and cites current guidelines that do not recommend trying to use aspirin to reduce cancer risk. The story also specifically notes that while the researchers did not get outside funding for this study, several of the authors have been paid consultants to pharmaceutical companies. The story not only highlights comments from those who say it is too early to recommend aspirin as a way to reduce cancer risk, it includes a comment recommending keeping a healthy body weight and not smoking in order to prevent cancer. The availability of aspirin is well-known. Indeed it is so common as to be often perceived as innocuous. Since readers may take aspirin without consulting a health care professional, stories about aspirin should clearly distinguish between those uses that a well-supported by evidence and those that require further evaluation. The story points out that certain people already take low-dose aspirin because of heart disease concerns. The context and cautions included in this story are a welcomed departure from some other stories we reviewed. The story notes that this study adds to previous research that has looked at the potential cancer-related effects of aspirin. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.",0
"There is no mention of cost for the device itself or for the implantation surgery. The news release says manufacture is rapid, but gives no indication as to the actual time it takes, nor are the device’s component materials mentioned, so no estimation of materials costs can be made. The cost for 3D printed knee replacements are undoubtedly higher than traditional replacements. The news release states that a personalized knee joint would fit better and therefore provide better results. However, there is no data supporting how much better the device fits, how closely existing knee replacement devices do fit, nor is there any mention of how patients lives improved after receiving the implants. Did they have less pain? Increased mobility? Some measurement is needed here. The news release does not mention any potential harms from knee replacement surgery in general or for the 3-D printed knee replacement specifically. There are risks associated with new medical devices and the risks increase when the device has not been tested. The release doesn’t include any evidence. There are testimonials from two surgeons who implanted the two devices and a statement by Jean Robichaud, president of Bodycad, who said “These recent procedures reinforce a growing body of evidence that demonstrates the benefit of personalized restorations.” But no reference is provided for that evidence. There is no disease mongering. A percentage of the aging population and some athletes will require knee replacement surgery. While no funding sources are mentioned, it is obvious from the news release that Bodycad is the funding source of their device. There is also an obvious conflict of interest because the company wants to sell their product and the company controls the U.S. patent. But this is expected from a news release from a company touting its own product. At least one of the surgeons quoted in the release has received funding from manufacturers of joint replacement devices. Dr. Brain Hamlin received $$87,737 from Smith & Nephew in 2016 and $8,127 from Depuy Orthopaedics, also in 2016, according to Open Payments, a federal transparency program. These conflicts should have been included in the release. While the news release does compare the 3-D printed device to conventional devices suggesting that personalized devices are better, there are no data showing that this is the case. The whole point of the news release is to say that Bodycad can make personalized knee replacements and it has implanted two of them and it worked. By mentioning that the devices were cleared for use in the U.S. and Europe the company makes it clear they are available. It’s unknown, though, how many surgeons have been trained in the use of the devices. The news release doesn’t establish novelty. In fact, it implies that other companies are making personalized knee replacement devices, but that theirs is better. The news release states, “The efficient, rapid, and highly automated process is the only one of its kind in the world that is impeccably integrated between software and modern manufacturing such as 3D printing.” Companies have been developing customized joint replacement devices for about 25 years. Last year, a company called ConforMIS released results from its prospective study of 62 patients that received either its customized knee replacement product or a conventional device. The release’s use of the word “revolutionary” is unjustified because 1) customized knee replacement devices are not unique to this company and 2) the release provided no evidence of its benefits.",1
"In March 2015, rumors appeared on social media that dog treat brand Canine Carry Outs (commonly misspelled as “Canine Carryouts”) contains anti-freeze under the “hidden” ingredient name of propylene glycol and is therefore dangerous to feed to dogs. Similar rumors had circulated online about Canine Carry Outs before the claim migrated to Facebook in 2015 (as well as earlier Facebook version did not circulate as widely):  The Canine Carry Outs warning closely resembled a similar rumor about Purina’s Beneful brand pet food, which circulated in early 2015 as well. Although Beneful wasn’t mentioned in the Facebook warning shown above, it’s possible that the rumor also stemmed from earlier alerts that mentioned other brands of dog foods in conjunction with propylene glycol. It’s not accurate to suggest that propylene glycol is a “hidden” ingredient in pet treats, is the same thing as “anti-freeze,” and is inherently dangerous to dogs in any amount. As the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) explains, propylene glycol is a common food additive that is classified as “generally recognized as safe” when consumed within recommended limits:  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified propylene glycol as an additive that is “generally recognized as safe” for use in food. It is used to absorb extra water and maintain moisture in certain medicines, cosmetics, or food products. It is a solvent for food colors and flavors, and in the paint and plastics industries. Propylene glycol is also used to create artificial smoke or fog used in fire-fighting training and in theatrical productions. Other names for propylene glycol are 1,2-dihydroxypropane, 1,2-propanediol, methyl glycol, and trimethyl glycol. Although propylene glycol is not approved for use in cat food, it is classed as generally recognized as safe for dogs in addition to humans and is not “anti-freeze,” as Purina noted in response to questions about its use in pet food:  Propylene glycol is quite different from ethylene glycol, the anti-freeze used in automobiles. Propylene glycol is approved as a food additive in human food and in feed for animals, except cats, in the U.S. and Canada. Ethylene glycol — not propylene glycol — is the active compound in most automobile radiator anti-freeze solutions, and is toxic to animals and humans when ingested. Propylene glycol has a different molecular structure, giving it different properties and allowing it to be used safely in animal feed, except for cats, as well as in human foods, such as cake mixes, salad dressings, soft drinks, popcorn, food coloring, fat-free ice cream and sour cream. Propylene glycol can be used as a non-toxic anti-freeze, just as salt can be used as an “anti-freeze.” The differences in the molecular make-up of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol have significantly different impacts on health and safety for humans and pets. Propylene glycol is approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A similar rumor was spread in 2016 by Dr. Chloe Charlton, a veterinarian in Little Rock, Arkansas, who claimed that one of her canine patients had been “poisoned” by Canine Carry Outs, that “a report to the FDA has come back conclusive,” and that the FDA had “recommended removal of these treats”:  When the Petful website attempted to question Dr. Charlton regarding the many questionable aspects of her claims, she declined to be interviewed. In fact, contrary to what Dr. Charlton asserted, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has never issued any warning or recall/withdrawal notice about Canine Carry Outs brand dog treats.",1
"""Chile, an eager adapter of free-market principles in Latin America, has long been a favorite of economic conservatives. Recently, a decision by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the club of rich nations -- to invite Chile to become a member has become, for many on the right, symbolic of how adhering to free-market principles can vault former Third World countries into economic affluence. In a video blog post dated Jan. 15, 2010, conservative TV and radio host Glenn Beck championed Chile as a nation no longer """"struggling with poverty,"""" having overcome a reputation for corruption and bureaucracy through such policies as freer labor markets and lower taxes. In addition to citing the OECD invitation, Beck pointed to its high standing in recent international ratings of """"economic freedom."""" """"They ranked 71st of 72 in 1975 in a study of economic freedom in the world,"""" Beck said in his video blog post. """"Now, in that same study, they rank third. The U.S. is ranked 17th."""" We wondered whether Chile is really that far ahead of the U.S. in """"economic freedom,"""" so we looked at the data. We located an editorial in Investor's Business Daily -- a leading voice for free-market capitalism -- that appears to be the source of Beck's statistic. The editorial, published Dec. 4, 2009, was later picked up by a smattering of conservative bloggers on its way to Beck's desk. The editorial said in part, """"In the Cato Institute's 1975 Economic Freedom of the World Report, [Chile] ranked a wretched 71 out of 72 countries evaluated. Today it's a different country altogether. Embracing markets has made it one of the most open economies in the world, ranking third on Cato's index, just behind Hong Kong and Singapore."""" Later on, the editorial added that the United States """"ranks just 17th on Cato's 2009 Index of Economic Freedom."""" However, if you look at the 2009 Economic Freedom of the World study by Cato -- a libertarian think tank in Washington -- the numbers were actually different. Hong Kong and Singapore did indeed rank 1 and 2, respectively, but then came New Zealand and Switzerland before Chile at No. 5. In the No. 6 spot, behind by a fraction of a point, was the United States. So while it's true that, by Cato's reckoning, Chile ranked ahead of the United States, it was less of a blowout than Beck or IBD indicated. We also looked at the two prior years' Cato studies to make sure that Beck wasn't simply off by a year. That wasn't the case. In the 2008 study, Chile ranked No. 6 with the United States at 8, in a two-way tie with Australia and once again behind by a fraction of a point. And in the 2007 study, the United States actually ranked higher than Chile. The United States was tied for fifth while Chile was tied for 11th. One of the co-authors of Cato's 2009 study -- Joshua Hall, a Beloit College economist -- also confirmed to PolitiFact that the United States has never ranked as low as 17th in all the years that study has been conducted. Another co-author, James Gwartney, a Florida State University economist, confirmed that Beck was correct in saying that Chile ranked 71st out of 72 countries in 1975. In the meantime, we also looked at whether Beck (or IBD) had mistaken the Cato study for a different report. As it happens, there are at least three other studies that attempt to rank the nations of the world based on """"economic freedom"""" or a similar yardstick. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, publishes an annual Index of Economic Freedom. In 2009, the United States ranked sixth in its study while Chile ranked 11th. The World Economic Forum, a Geneva-based international organization, publishes an annual Global Competitiveness Index. Its 2009-10 ratings peg the United States at No. 2 and Chile at 30. Finally, the World Bank publishes an annual """"Doing Business"""" ranking that seeks to measure which countries have a regulatory environment """"conducive to the operation of business."""" In this tally, the United States finished fourth overall with Chile 49th. Given these ratings, it would seem unlikley that Beck or IBD could have accidentally been referring to any of these studies. However, we would be remiss if we failed to add that, despite the apparent flub on reporting the rankings, Beck's overall assessment of Chile's recent economic history is largely accurate. We spoke with three experts on Latin American economics and politics who work with centrist-to-liberal think tanks -- Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations, Andres Martinez of the New America Foundation and Leonardo Martinez-Diaz of the Brookings Institution -- and they agreed that there is a broad ideological consensus on Beck's two key points: Namely, Chile has improved its economic position in recent years and that free-market policies can take some of the credit. """"If trends continue, Chile will soon be considered one of those rare countries that has graduated out of the developing world, according to plenty of living-standard indices,"""" Andres Martinez said. """"The country is also the poster child for those who believe globalization and free trade can lift living standards, as Chile's economic course has long been anchored in its free-trade agreement with the U.S. and its dynamic export sector. It also stands out among South American countries in that its governing socialists have pragmatically been the ones embracing this pro-business, market-oriented economy."""" So while there is some truth to Beck's underlying point that Chile has improved its economic freedom, he's wrong to portray Chile as ranking far ahead of the United States. By several measures, the United States ranks significantly higher than Chile; in one, Chile is slightly ahead. So we find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to .""",1
"In August 2013, Discovery Channel kicked off its popular annual “Shark Week” programming with an episode entitled Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives (and followed it up in August 2014 with Megalodon: The New Evidence). That installment featured the efforts of a group of “researchers” to document the possibility that the prehistoric megalodon species of shark (the largest predatory marine creature in Earth’s history, measuring from about 46–59 ft. in length) has not been extinct for more than a million years, as current scientific belief holds:   The episode featured vivid segments such researchers recounting their attempts to tag a megalodon from a submerged shark cage, and supposed video footage of a South African charter vessel that capsized after something (presumably a shark of monstrous size) rammed and/or bit it. Of course, the faux “researchers” in this episode (“marine biologist” Colin Drake isn’t a real person but rather a fictional role played by actor Darron Meyer) never did find hard evidence of a living megalodon; they merely claimed to have tagged something that escaped by supposedly diving deeper than any known shark, but they didn’t get a good look at it. And if something chomped and capsized a vessel off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa, on 5 April 2013, killing several people, the South African press apparently didn’t find that event noteworthy enough to report on at all. The megalodon species of shark did exist, and it’s not absolutely impossible that an undocumented species of huge shark lives in the oceans’ depths (after all, it was only fairly recently that scientists documented the existence of the giant squid). But no such discovery or substantive evidence about living megalodons was at hand in the 2013 “Shark Week” premiere, and as Christie Wilcox wrote in a Discover blog entry, the possibility that some megalodons might still be around isn’t even a subject of genuine inquiry or controversy among legitimate scientists:  “This documentary was the first time I’ve ever even heard it suggested that Megalodon may still exist,” said  Daniel Holstein, a post doc with the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. “There’s about as much scientific controversy about the possibility of Megalodons lurking in today’s oceans as there is about mermaids. None.” David Kerstetter, an assistant professor at the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center in Dania Beach, Florida, whose current work includes reducing shark bycatch in fisheries, had a similar response. “There is no discussion among fisheries professionals whether Megalodon is extinct,” he said. “If even one credible scientist had doubts about this, the Discovery Channel wouldn’t have had to use actors.” “As a researcher focused on mako sharks, I often discuss Megalodon with my colleagues,” explained Dovi Kacev, a PhD candidate at San Diego State University studying the population genetics of shortfin mako and common thresher sharks. “We sometimes discuss what it would be like if Megalodon still existed — what it would prey upon, where it would live,” he said. But as to its current existence? “Never do any of my colleagues or I ever plausibly argue that Megalodon is still extant.”  Just as in the case of the faked Mermaids: The Body Found documentary (which aired on Animal Planet, part of the Discovery Channel family), Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives included a briefly-displayed disclaimer declaring the program’s use of “dramatized” events and characters to make up for a lack of hard science and credible evidence:  None of the institutions or agencies that appear in the film are affiliated with it in any way, nor have approved its contents. Though certain events and characters in this film have been dramatized, sightings of “Submarine” continue to this day. Megalodon was a real shark. Legends of giant sharks persist all over the world. There is still debate about what they might be. “Submarine,” the legendary (but non-existent) 35-foot monster shark reappeared in the Discovery Channel’s “Shark Week” feature Shark of Darkness: Wrath of Submarine in 2014, with yet more claims of its deliberately attacking a ship off the coast of South Africa. That episode also featured a disclaimer noting that the “Submarine” material is largely fictionalized drama based on hearsay and rumor, and there’s no actual physical evidence documenting that such a creature exists and has attacked ships:  Submarine is a legendary shark first sighted off the coast of South Africa in 1970. Eyewitness accounts say it is over 35 feet long. Its existence is highly controversial. Events have been dramatized, but many believe Submarine exists to this day. As Bob Strauss commented in his article “Megalodon — The Monster Shark Lives! (Not)“:  What can you say about a TV documentary in which the suspiciously good-looking lead protagonist — “marine biologist” Collin Drake — comes up empty in a Google search? Or, for that matter, his equally attractive “marine biologist” pal Madelyn Joubert, who joins him halfway through the show, and whom a cursory web search easily demonstrates not to exist? And, not to belabor the point, a TV show that starts with suspiciously staged-looking video footage of a charter boat capsizing off the coast of South Africa, and no references can be found about this accident (in which three passengers were supposedly killed) from reliable online news sources? I don’t know much about charter boats, but I do know that people whose ship is in the process of sinking do not take the trouble to center their subjects on frame. I’m shocked that a major TV channel with a supposedly educational purview can get away with this drivel, in which “Collin Drake” (whoever he is in real life) pursues his theory that that charter boat was rammed by a living Megalodon. We’re taken through various pieces of “evidence” — sonar sightings, Nazi-era photographs, whale carcasses washed up on the beach — but if Discovery is brazen enough to manufacture its “talking heads” out of whole cloth, what is the point of assessing the reliability of these details? Or, as Christie Wilcox concluded:  No whale with a giant bite taken out of it has ever washed up here in Hawaii. No fishing vessel went mysteriously missing off of South Africa in April. No one has ever found unfossilized Megalodon teeth. Collin Drake? Doesn’t exist. The evidence was faked, the stories fabricated, and the scientists portrayed on it were actors. The idea that Megalodon could still be roaming the ocean is a complete and total myth. Here’s what I don’t get, Discovery: Megalodons were real, incredible, fascinating sharks. There’s a ton of actual science about them that is well worth a two hour special. We’ve discovered their nursery grounds off the coast of Panama, for example. Their bite is thought to be the strongest of all time — strong enough to smash an automobile — beating out even the most monstrous dinosaurs. The real science of these animals should have been more than enough to inspire Discovery Channel viewers. But it’s as if you don’t care anymore about presenting the truth or reality. You chose, instead, to mislead your viewers with 120 minutes of bullshit. And the sad part is, you are so well trusted by your audience that you actually convinced them: according to your poll, upwards of 70% of your viewing public fell for the ruse and now believes that Megalodon isn’t extinct.",1
"The story included cost estimates for both treatments. The story notes there was no difference in the diagnostic value of the two approaches but does note a difference in time and costs. The story provides a somewhat confusing and overly complicated picture of the risks of the CT scans without putting the risks into context with the standard diagnostic procedures. While there is a detailed listing of radiation exposure to the CT scan, no information is provided on the burden of the standard testing. Noting the radiation exposure in millisieverts without comparative information does little to inform the reader of the relative risks of the two approaches studied. The link between radiation exposure and the risk of developing cancer is perhaps beyond the scope of the story. A simple citation (for example – http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MedicalX-Rays/ucm115329.htm ) would have helped the readers better understand the size of the risk. While the story states that a more definitive study is underway, it does not comment on the limitations on drawing conclusions from study results that have only been presented at a conference and have not been subjected to peer review.",0
"In August 2011 a warning began circulating online, decrying an insect known as the White Hickory Tussock Moth Caterpillar, which is native in Canada from Nova Scotia to Ontario and in the U.S. from the northeast to the south central part of the country:   Little white and black caterpillars all over are POISONOUS. they are apparently new to the area….. doctors say there has been numerous kids having reactions to them. the rash spreads fast. the caterpillars have long white hairs that embed in skin and send poison through out the body. DO NOT TOUCH and DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS TOUCH!!! they look cute and fuzzy and THEY ARE NOT! Please repost to everyone you know with little kids!! This caterpillar appears between June and September and munches its way through the leaves of deciduous trees (it prefers nut-bearing trees, but will settle for willow, ash, aspen, apple, oak, and even raspberry plants and corn stalks). While it does make rather a feast of the leaves it dines on, it does not tend to cause lasting damage to the trees themselves. The caterpillar excretes a type of chemical defense upon contact (which is more properly termed ‘allergenic’ than ‘poisonous’). Most people who handle these creatures will experience a burning, nettle-type, itchy rash of mild to moderate severity, but washing the affected area with soap and water, then applying ammonia or calamine lotion and icing the area should set things to rights. However, some people are hypersensitive to the poison and have allergic reactions to it — in addition to the itchy rash, those persons are likely to experience more severe symptoms such as swelling and nausea and should seek expert medical advice as soon as possible:  The hairs on the caterpillar are long and bristle-like and spread out in tufts down the sides. Two long, sharp, black pencil-like hairs protrude near the front and rear of the creature, and these hairs are connected to poison glands, which excrete venom on contact. Contact with the venom does not generally cause too much of a problem. A nettle or poison ivy-type rash often occurs, which can range from mild with slight reddening of the skin, to burning, swelling and pain, none of which should keep you away from your gardening duties for too long. Hypersensitive individuals may, of course, experience more severe symptoms that could include swelling and nausea. Washing the infected area with soap and water, taking antihistamines, or using ammonia, calamine lotion, or an ice pack can help to alleviate most minor symptoms fairly quickly. People who do experience more severe reactions, however, should seek expert medical advice as soon as possible.",0
"“More health care is happening at home,” said Susannah Fox, associate director of the Pew Research Center’s Internet and American Life project and the study’s lead author. “As more people are able to be saved by medical advances, their lives are being extended, but they’re also being sent home medically fragile. It’s caregivers who are the first line of defense.”  Researchers, which found that the number of caregivers increased 10 percent between 2010 and 2013, surveyed 3,014 adults nationwide and found that most caregivers were between 30 and 64 years old. Fox also said the slow U.S. economy could explain why family members are becoming more responsible for care. With fewer or depleted savings, many people are less able to hire professional help, she said. About half of the United States population has at least one chronic condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adults ages 65 and older, 75 percent of whom have chronic conditions, are expected to make up 19 percent of the population by 2030, compared with 12 percent in 2000. “As a chronic illness progresses, family members step in to help out,” said Denise Brown, founder of the support site caregiving.com. “There’s a better understanding of the progression of the disease than the practitioner because they live with it.”  Fox said many caregivers become “voracious information consumers” who regularly tap into online resources to help them care for family or to cope with stress. “They want to turn up the volume on every resource of healthcare,” she said. Nearly half of adults surveyed in an earlier Pew Research Study said they expect to care for an elderly parent or relative at some point. Fox said the number of caregivers will likely continue increasing.",0
"On 22 March 2016 a Facebook user published the above-reproduced status update, claiming that Pantene hair products caused a potentially dangerous reaction on the hair of a client who was getting foil highlights. According to the poster, a hair salon client complained that the foils in her hair (under which bleach had been applied) felt hot. The colorist maintained that upon examining the situation, he was shocked to discover that the foils were indeed hot to the touch and that when he opened them “smoke [came] billowing out” of the sealed foil. The stylist stated that after he asked all the typical question about product interactions, his client admitted that she used Pantene shampoo and conditioner on her hair. Oddly enough, the colorist then recalled two separate instances in which clients experienced adverse reactions to unspecified services, both of which shared a culprit: Pantene hair products. We contacted a colorist with two decades of experience in hair color about this claim, and she reported she had not encountered of such reaction with Pantene products during her years of experience doing highlight foils despite Pantene products’ popularity her clients. Several other salon representatives with whom we spoke from a number of high-volume New York City salons stated they’d never seen nor heard of such a thing occurring either. A large number of clients across the U.S. likely use Pantene products daily and and highligh their hair, but social media are not awash in foil fire stories from harried hair salon-goers. We also contacted Pantene to ask about the claim. A customer care representative with whom we spoke said that Pantene’s products were safe to use in combination with any typical salon service and reported she was unable to locate any reports of “smoking” foils despite the enduring popularity of hair highlighting. The representative stated that all Pantene products were thoroughly tested for reactions such ads the one described in the Facebook post, and none of that their testing had suggested any likelihood of a such an outcome. The representative did state that had the described incident occurred, it was possible something else used in the salon could have contributed to the reaction. The original poster referenced “plastic and silicones” as a culprit in the purported incident. Pantene lists all their product ingredients on their web site, and nothing in the ingredients list of one of their shampoos (Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal) was atypical or unusual: Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide Mea, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium Edta, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone. In fact, the drugstore product had many ingredients in common with the pricier, salon-favorite Bumble and Bumble Seaweed Shampoos: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sorbitol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sea Salt, Ascophyllum Nodosum (Seaweed) Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Sea Kelp) Extract, Spirulina Maxima Extract, Hydrolyzed Algae Extract, Ascorbic Acid, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-7, Glycerin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Bisulfite, Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Chlorphenesin, Sodium Benzoate, Caramel, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Green 3 (CI 42053), Limonene, Fragrance. Of particular note is the fact that both products (one sold in salons, the other in Walmart stores) contain the popular silicon-based polymer Dimethicone. The ingredient similarities extend to conditioners, as Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal version bears the following list of components: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium Edta, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone. Compared with Bumble and Bumble’s Super Rich Conditioner, the formulations have many common ingredients: Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, PPG-2 Myristyl Ether Propionate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Stearalkonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Distearate, Dimethicone, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Yellow 6 (CI 15985), Linalool, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Fragrance. Of additional interest was the fact that the poster claimed Pantene contains “plastic(s)” among its ingredients. A chemophobic 2009 Salon item fingered one purportedly common “plastic” in shampoo as PEG-7M, but that substance is actually a common emulsifier present in the salon (not drug store) product referenced above. Sold on its own, the product is labeled as an “all-purpose oil-in-water emulsifier.” As it turns out, the “plastic in Pantene” rumor wasn’t a new one in 2016. A 2008 post on the beauty science blog Beauty Brains examined then-swirling rumors around panthenol (a moisturizer and humectant) and panthenyl (used for moisturizing properties). In April 2008, the cosmetic chemists behind that blog fielded a similar question about plastic in Pantene products: well im doing a science fair project on this and pantene and this site is very helpful and im just saying never attempt using pantene cause this is what will happen Supposedly it coats your hair with plastic or wax to make your hair seem silky and smooth. It also makes your scalp itchy and it makes your hair fall out. If you know anything about reading ingredients. You know that the first 5-10 are the main ingredients and have the most impact on your hair. Well, panthenol and panthenyl are in the first 5-10. Which both of these ingredients are pure wax. That’s why if you use Pantene when u touch your hair your not really touching your hair. Your touching the half to in inch of waxy coating you have developed on you’re hair.well just saying hopefully this is helpful info and im 100% sure its correct cause i asked professionals and im only 13 The blog responded by suggesting that the plastic claim was started by stylists seeking to discourage clients from using less-expensive drugstore products. The blog also urged readers to obtain information about product formulations from additional sources, not just people trying to sell them things: Thanks for checking in with the Beauty Brains about your science project. Lefty and Righty have answered questions about Pantene before and they say that the idea that it coats your hair with plastic is a myth started by stylists to keep you from buying salon products. (BTW, Pantene contains silicone, not plastic.) And the notion that when you touch your hair you’re really feeling Pantene is bogus. I don’t know as much about formulation chemistry as Lefty but even I know that there’s NO WAY you’re leaving half inch to an inch of product on your hair. That would be a TON of gunk left behind! No conditioner leaves that much stuff on your hair … if you really want to be “100% sure” you shouldn’t only talk to professional stylists. And you shouldn’t “only” listen to the Beauty Brains either. Do your own research on the web, read Paula Begoun’s Cosmetic Cop website, contact Pantene and ask them what they say about their products, check with the Society of Cosmetic Chemists. But whatever you do, open your mind and THINK for yourself. It’s hard to be 100% sure of anything. (Note that the Facebook post quoted at the head of this article concluded by stating “There is a difference between cheap and salon quality. Do not let anyone lie to you and try to say anything more …” The original question fielded by Beauty Brains in July 2006 involved a reader who asked whether it was true Pantene “coats your hair with plastic or wax to make it seem smooth, soft, and shiny, instead of really moisturizing your hair.” Their response explained how that myth got started and why it was easy to debunk: While most stylists are very talented at cutting and styling hair, they’re not very talented at interpreting cosmetic formulations. The truth is, Pantene’s shampoo and conditioner formulas are believed to be among the best in the industry by those of us in the cosmetic science side of the business. It makes sense if you think about it. P&G, makers of Pantene, have a HUGE research budget. Certainly larger than any salon company. That means they can afford to dedicate resources to developing and testing the best formulas possible. We’ve seen Pantene formulas beat the pants of salon products in blind consumer testing. (The products are hidden or blinded, not the consumers) So why do stylists say that Pantene coats the hair with plastic, or make it fall out? Because that’s what they’re told by the sales representatives for the salon companies. And the truth is, it’s just not true! Compare the ingredient lists for Pantene conditioner and any salon brand you can find. Even though the names vary you’ll see three basic types of ingredients: fatty alcohols (like cetyl and stearyl alcohol); conditioning ingredients (like stearamidopropylamine and quaternium-18) and silicones (like dimethicone and cyclomethicone.) There’s nary a plastic to be found in Pantene. And no, it doesn’t make your hair fall out either.",1
"The release doesn’t discuss costs of the mice chow used in the study but we’ll still rate this Not Applicable since our emphasis is on human interventions. People wanting to embark on a semi-fasting program could do so without purchasing any products. The benefits are given very sketchy treatment. For example, the release says, “Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food.” The release never tells us how many mice were in the study nor how much less they weighed than the control group at the end of the trial. The release also provides what it calls molecular detail about benefits to the experimental fasting mice vs. the control mice. But again, the quantities and context are not there. “Through an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body’s reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.” What are the changes? How were they measured? We don’t see any numbers in this description to help the reader evaluate the credibility of the data. The release does not mention any potential harms that could exist for intermittent fasting. While the published study discussed the study limitations and the “practicality” of doing similar experiments with humans, the news release doesn’t acknowledge any limitations or explain to readers that animal studies are rarely replicated in humans and that much more study was called for by the authors to examine if “(1) beneficial effects of IF last after stopping the fasting (i.e., if there is a rebound effect); (2) whether there is any potential harm of IF; and (3) whether IF benefits apply to all generations (i.e., an age-dependent issue) and disease conditions.” There was no disease mongering. The research was funded by a variety of grants which were listed in the sidebar of the EurekAlert! site, but not in the news release text. The authors declared in the journal article that they had no conflicts of interest. While the release is written as if it could help inform human obesity treatment or prevention, there is no discussion of how obesity is treated or prevented now and the many alternatives available. These include changes in exercise and diet patterns and bariatric surgery. Fasting is widely available. The release does not make a claim of novelty. In the journal article, the authors write that others have established the ability of intermittent fasting to promote weight loss. They do say that they have identified a mechanism that might explain why weight loss occurs in fasting mice which could be considered novel. We think the headline is stretching things by stating “On and off fasting helps fight obesity.” The average reader likely assumes the obesity referred to is in humans and not mice. The release doesn’t clarify that the study was only in mice until the fourth sentence. “Up to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting without otherwise having to count calories helps fight obesity and other metabolic disorders. Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals’ metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.”",1
"Although the report stopped short of explicitly advocating going meat free, it called for big changes to farming and eating habits to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on stretched land and water resources. Plant-based foods and sustainable animal-sourced food could free up several million square kilometers of land by 2050 and cut 0.7-8.0 gigatonnes a year of carbon dioxide equivalent, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said. “There are certain kinds of diets that have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land,” Jim Skea, professor at London’s Imperial College, said on Thursday. The IPCC met this week in Geneva, Switzerland to finalize its report which should help to guide governments meeting this year in Chile on ways to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. “The IPCC does not recommend people’s diets ... Dietary choices are very often shaped or influenced by local production practices and cultural habits,” Skea, who is one of the report’s authors, told reporters in Geneva. Land can be both a source and sink of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming, and better land management can help to tackle climate change, the IPCC said. But it is not the only solution and cutting emissions from all sectors is essential to quickly curtail global warming. “The window for making these changes is closing fast. If there is further delay in reducing emissions, we will miss the opportunity to successfully manage the climate change transition in the land sector,” it said. Since the pre-industrial era, land surface air temperature has risen by 1.53 degrees Celsius, twice as much as the global average temperature (0.87C), causing more heatwaves, droughts and heavy rain, as well as land degradation and desertification. Human use directly affects more than 70% of the global, ice-free land surface and agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater use, the IPCC added in the report. Agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for 23% of total net man-made greenhouse gas emissions during 2007-2016. When pre- and post-production activity in the food system are included, that rises to up to 37%. Last year the IPCC’s first special report warned that keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), rather than the 2C target agreed under the Paris accord, required rapid change across society. The IPCC warned of more disruption to global food chains as extreme weather becomes more frequent due to climate change and said environmental costs should be factored into food. It projects a median increase of 7.6% in cereal prices by 2050, meaning higher food prices and an increased risk of hunger. While an estimated 821 million people are undernourished, changing consumption habits have already contributed to about 2 billion adults being overweight or obese. Per capita supply of vegetable oils and meat has more than doubled based on data since 1961 but 25-30% of total food produced is still lost or wasted. Yields of crops such as maize and wheat have declined in some regions, while those of maize, wheat and sugar beets have increased in others in recent decades. While forests can soak up heat-trapping gases from the atmosphere, desertification and deforestation can amplify warming due to the loss of vegetation cover and soil erosion. Measures to cut emissions, such as the production of biofuels, biochar - made from biomass - as well as planting trees, will also increase demand for land conversion. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation could result in a reduction of 0.4-5.8 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent, the report said. The Amazon, about 60% of which lies in Brazil, is sometimes called the “lungs of the world” due to the amount of CO2 it can absorb but it was not directly mentioned in the IPCC’s summary for policymakers. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has supported opening up protected areas of the world’s largest tropical rainforest to facilitate agriculture and mining since taking office in January. The report text is prepared by over 100 scientists but has to be approved by governments. In those discussions, Brazil and India were very active to protect their national agro-industrial interests, a source familiar with the talks said.",0
"Although print references to this gang initiation scare date to 1993, anecdotal information places it as far back as the early 1980s when a reader in Montana heard the Hell’s Angels bike gang in California was said to be initiating inductees in this fashion. By 1984 the story had spread to Eugene, Oregon and had by then changed into a tale of Black and hispanic street gangs in Los Angeles targeting white people. “Flash your headlights and have a prospective gang member kill you as part of his initiation” legends have been with us for more than thirty years, something that should be kept in mind as hysteria builds during new outbreaks of this panic: [Collected via e-mail, November 2010] please dont flash your headlights at any car with no headlights on! Police officers is working with the DARE program and has issued this warning! if you are driving after dark and see a on-coming car with no headlights on, “do not flash your headlights at them” this is a common “Bloods” gang member “initiation game”. the new gang member, under initiation, drives along with no headlights on and the 1st car to flash their headlights at them is now his “target.” he is now required to turn around and chase that car, then shoot and kill individual in the vehicle in order to complete his initiation requirements. police departments across the nation are being warned. the gang’s intent is to have “bloods” nationwide, drive around on Friday and Saturday nights with their headlights off. in order to be accepted into the gang, they have to shoot and kill all individuals in the 1st auto that does a “courtesy” flash. please forward to all loved ones!

Important police warning Very scary, now moving west…. started in… Manitoba, now in Saskatchewan and moving west. Police Warning – For Your Information: This is very scary and came directly from our Driver Training People who got the warning from Manitoba. Pass this to anyone you can. One of the officers who works with the dare program has passed along the following warning and asked that it be shared with all drivers. This is an extremely serious matter. If you are driving after dark and you see a car without its head-lights on do not flash your lights, do not blow your horn or make any signals to the driver of the other car. There is a new common gang initiation ‘game’ going on the streets. The new member being initiated drives along without his headlights on until someone notices and flashes their headlights or makes some sort of other action to signal him. The gang member is now required to chase the car and shoot at or into the car in order to complete his initiation requirements. Make sure you share this information with your family, friends, and anyone else you can reach. If you have any questions or information, please call your local police department. Please take this seriously. This is not a joke. Please pass this on to everyone you know on e-mail and in person. It could save someone’s life. [Collected via e-mail, 2004] I have received the following serious information via a contact at the London Ambulance Service which has units closely associated with South London police squads which are involved in fighting Gang Crimes. Some ‘street gangs’ in London (particularly South London at present, but it is sure to spread) have initiation tasks which new gang members have to carry out to be admitted to the ‘gang’. The latest craze is to drive around, deliberately with no lights on their cars. The first person who ‘flashes’ them, points at them or sounds their horn at them, has to be followed by that new gang member in their car, who then has to fire a shot into that vehicle !!! with no regard as to who is inside. The LAS official instruction is that if they see a vehicle with no lights on, they are NOT to ‘flash’ it etc. and the advice to friends and family is that you should ignore any vehicles you see without lights. I would ask that you pass this info on to family, friends and colleagues as it may save a life! [Collected via e-mail, 1998] Read & Heed! A police officer working with the DARE program has issued this warning: If you are driving after dark and see an on-coming car with no headlights on, DO NOT FLASH YOUR LIGHTS AT THEM! This is a common gang member “initiation game” that goes like this: The new gang member under initiation drives along with no headlights, and the first car to flash their headlights at him is now his “target”. He is now required to turn around and chase that car, and shoot at or into the car in order to complete his initiation requirements. Make sure you share this information with all the drivers in your family! Although print references to this gang initiation scare date to 1993, anecdotal information places it as far back as the early 1980s when a reader in Montana heard the Hell’s Angels bike gang in California was said to be initiating inductees in this fashion. By 1984 the story had spread to Eugene, Oregon and had by then changed into a tale of Black and hispanic street gangs in Los Angeles targeting white people. “Flash your headlights and have a prospective gang member kill you as part of his initiation” legends have been with us for more than twenty years, something that should be kept in mind as hysteria builds during new outbreaks of this panic. In August 1993, a major outbreak of this scare swept the United States as the legend spread quickly with the help of fax machines and e-mail forwards. The early fears were further intensified when a new round of faxes went out a few weeks later, these announcing a “Blood initiation weekend” of September 25 and 26 of that year: Police Depts across the nation are being warned that this is the “blood” initiation weekend. Their intent is to have all the new bloods nationwide drive around on Saturday and Sunday nights with their headlights off. In order to be accepted into the gang, they have to shoot and kill all individuals in the first auto that does a courtesy flash to warn them that their lights are off. “Blood initiation weekend” came and went without incident. Meanwhile, fake memos continued to circulate, each issuing a dire warning about this new gang initiation rite. The alerts looked credible — they were printed on what was purported to be Sacramento (California) or Illinois State Police letterhead. The police department in Lynn (Massachusetts) also got into the act when a prankster induced it to issue a warning. All three of those law enforcement agencies fielded thousands of calls about the alerts they had supposedly authored. The false rumor struck especially hard in Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, New York State, California, and Texas. From the end of 1993 until February 1994, it went into remission. Then a Massillon woman revived it with a one-page handwritten flier that said police were warning women to be aware because a gang was coming from Detroit to recruit members. Initiation would be to kill a woman at Belden Village Mall. In one night, she sent faxes to several dozen businesses. Police arrested Ann Sibila the next day and charged her with inducing panic. It’s possible the 1993 outbreak of this hoax was helped along by memories of a real life incident in 1992. Kelly Freed, a school secretary from Stockton, California, was shot to death after the driver of the car she was riding in gestured to a carload of kids who had forgotten to turn their headlights on. According to Stockton Police Lt. Ted Montes, the gesture was mistaken as a sign of disrespect. Montes said the kids were not gang-bangers and the incident had nothing to do with ritual. The two youths responsible for Freed’s death were convicted of murder. The rumor lay dormant until October 1998 when it again whipped around the Internet and through fax machines. The warnings this time were said to have originated with a DARE police officer in Houston, Texas. Once again, it was the same old story: no gang initiations, no killings, just a hoax on the loose. A hoax which quickly spread to all parts of the U.S.A. Scares of this ilk easily pick up additional believability based on who does the forwarding. The 1998 version was given an extra little boost in San Diego when Housing Commission staffers there forwarded the warning to other city departments, including the Mayor’s office and City Council. Though the “warning” was quickly debunked and short-circuited at City Hall, this didn’t happen before those forwards — now issuing from a local government agency and thus much more likely to be believed — spread far and wide. In common with versions in circulation in other parts of the country, the San Diego warning was said to have originated with the Sheriff’s Department. (In most every community this warning reaches, the “Sheriff’s Department” mentioned in the memo is always presumed to be the local one.) Debunking in San Diego was simple; someone at City Hall contacted the actual Sheriff’s Department for confirmation. “We certainly did not send it out,” said Lt. Ronald Van Raaphorst. Sometimes the actual warning does come from a real Sheriff’s Department. In the fall of 1998, the Nassau Sheriff’s Office in Florida forwarded the warning to the Fire Department, who subsequently sent it to every department in the city. In this case, the mistake originated with the Sheriff’s Office; it hadn’t bothered to check out a fax before forwarding it to others: Still, Ann Johnson, who supervises Nassau County dispatchers, said she thought the memo was serious enough to distribute. One of her part-time dispatchers brought it to her office and told her he had confirmed it with Jacksonville police, she said. So her office sent it to various agencies in the county. The 1998 prize for most authoritative vectoring of this canard goes to Art Eggleton, Canada’s Minister of Defence. On 20 November 1998, his office dispatched an “!!URGENT! !” security warning for all Ontario Members of Parliament. Later that same day, his office followed up the warning with an update advising recipients the original story was false. In 2004 the hoax jumped to Britain and through some form of garbling came to be associated with the London Ambulance Service. In widely-circulated e-mailed alerts, it was claimed gangs in London were initiating new members into their ranks via having them prove their mettle by shooting at whichever motorist blinked his headlights at them. Further, many of the e-mails asserted the warning has been “received and authenticated by the Metropolitan Police Intelligence Unit.” The London Ambulance Service posted this denial on their web site: HOAX E-MAIL An e-mail purported to have been issued by the London Ambulance Service on the subject of the police and gang crimes has been widely circulated in recent days. This originated from outside the Service and was forwarded by a member of staff to friends in good faith. Please be assured, however, that we have checked with the Metropolitan Police Service and the information contained within it is not genuine, so the message can be safely deleted. In 2004 a police officer in Thunder Bay, Ontario, forwarded the “lights out” warning to a colleague. That note subsequently escaped into the wild, leaving many with the impression that the Ontario Provincial Police had issued an official warning about gang members flashing their headlights at intended victims. The officer has since left a message on his voice mail indicating the alert bearing his name and signature block is an urban legend and that there have been “no known cases having occurred in Ontario or in Canada.” Moreover, according to that recording, his e-mail to a colleague was “never intended as a public advisory from the O.P.P.,” with callers advised to “Please disregard the message in its entirety.” That same e-mail bore the name and signature of a second officer, one in Ottawa. His voice mail recording also contains a denial of the alert, telling callers the warning is “completely false and inaccurate, and should not be passed on.” In 2005 an employee of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police passed to others a copy of the warning received in personal e-mail. The addition of this person’s signature block to the e-mail gave the specious heads-up the appearance of credibility, convincing many it really was an official warning from the RCMP. The confusion prompted the RCMP to post a denial on their web site: The following e-mail hoax has been circulating in Canada with an RCMP signature. One of our Saskatchewan employees sent this e-mail on to others in good faith without realizing it was untrue. The information contained in the e-mail is FALSE and the RCMP regrets any unnecessary alarm this may have caused the public. In September 2005 the unfounded warning about new members gaining acceptance into gangs via this method came to life once again, with warnings about the upcoming “Blood initiation weekend” springing up in communities across the nation. But of course what had people going in 2005 was but a reworking of previous baseless scares: Police Depts across the nation are being warned that September 23rd and 24th is the “blood” initiation weekend. Their intent is to have all the new bloods nation wide drive around on Friday and Saturday nights with their headlights off. In order to be accepted into the gang, they have to shoot and kill all individuals in the first auto that does a courtesy flash to warn them that their lights are off. [Collected via e-mail, 1993] Police Depts across the nation are being warned that this is the “blood” initiation weekend. Their intent is to have all the new bloods nationwide drive around on Saturday and Sunday nights with their headlights off. In order to be accepted into the gang, they have to shoot and kill all individuals in the first auto that does a courtesy flash to warn them that their lights are off. In late October 2005, the hoax hammered Mexico, with at least three different state agencies in that country issuing press releases about a Guatemalan gang named “Los Sangre” (The Blood). Supposedly, the Guatemalan office of Interpol alerted Mexico’s Federal Agency of Investigation, who in turn notified local authorities in Michoacan to this gang’s presence in Mexico and its plans to initiate new recruits during the two weekends prior to Halloween by having gang hopefuls drive about in darkened cars, then chase down and kill ordinary citizens who flashed headlights at them. These official alerts were quickly spread through the media to the general population, causing a great deal of anxiety. We were unable to locate any mentions of a Guatemalan gang or drug cartel going by the name “Los Sangre,” which would likely not be the case for a group of thugs that had a high enough profile for Interpol to know about it. By contrast, references to real Guatemalan gangs, such as Mara Salvatrucha and Mara 18 (aka MS-18), are rife. In November 2010 the “lights out!” warning came to be passed along as a cell phone text message. Throughout the history of the “lights out!” scare there have been occasional incidents involving flashing headlights that appear to fit the pattern of the legend but are merely incidental to it: spontaneous outbursts of road rage triggered by flashing headlights, criminals who used headlights as a way of luring prospective victims into stopping and getting out of their cars, (non-gang-related) imitative shootings, and false reports of crimes resembling the legend. Notable among the last category was a 22-year-old Wisconsin man who in October 2007 claimed he had been jumped and beaten by three men after he stopped his car on the shoulder of U.S. 41 because the automobile behind his was repeatedly flashing its headlights at him. A few weeks later, the purported victim was arrested on charges of filing a false police report after investigators found a witness who said the claimant had actually been beaten elsewhere under different circumstances.

"Bishop John Folda of the Catholic Diocese of Fargo got hepatitis from contaminated food while in Italy last month for a conference of newly ordained bishops, Aliceyn Magelky, spokeswoman for the diocese, said on Friday. Folda served Communion during Mass at three churches in Fargo and one church in Jamestown between September 27 and October 7, according to the North Dakota Department of Health. The Mass in Jamestown was at a convention of priests. “He feels terrible about it,” Magelky said. “He did not know when coming back that he had contracted the virus or he would have refrained from participating in Mass much sooner.”  Magelky said Folda is feeling better and has not been infectious since October 16, but is still not on a full work schedule. Priests who attended Folda’s Mass in Jamestown were notified directly of the bishop’s illness, she said. Hepatitis A can cause infection of the liver and is found in the feces of infected people, according to the health department. It is most often spread when people with the disease fail to wash their hands thoroughly and then touch other people. “The risk of people getting hepatitis A in this situation is low, but the department of health felt it was important for people to know about the possible exposure,” Molly Howell, immunization program manager for the agency said in a news release. The department encouraged people who received Communion from Folda to check with their doctors if they notice symptoms such as fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, pale stools or jaundice.",0
"In early May 2018, Illinois-area newspaper The Pantagraph posed an interesting question in a headline: If Illinois legalizes marijuana, what happens to pot-sniffing dogs? In broad strokes, the article discussed the potential financial hardship that could be wrought against police departments in that state should it approve the legalization of cannabis — a question that may be on the ballot in November. Those claims rely primarily on the testimony of Macon County Sheriff Howard Buffett, who told the paper: “The biggest thing for law enforcement is, you’re going to have to replace all of your dogs,” said Macon County Sheriff Howard Buffett, whose private foundation paid $2.2 million in 2016 to support K-9 units in 33 counties across Illinois. “So to me, it’s a giant step forward for drug dealers, and it’s a giant step backwards for law enforcements and the residents of the community.” Howard Buffett is the son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has been active in the Illinois law enforcement and philanthropy communities for years, and is an opponent of marijuana legalization. Buffett was selected by retiring Macon County Sheriff Thomas Schneider to serve the remainder of his term after that sheriff retired in part due to health concerns, and he was sworn into office on 15 September 2017. The most controversial comments in the article came from Chad Larner, the director of of the K-9 Training Academy in Macon County (a beneficiary of Buffett’s), who said that retraining the animals would be abusive, and thus many retired drug dogs would have to be euthanized if marijuana legalization were passed: Chad Larner, training director of the K-9 Training Academy in Macon County, dismissed the idea of retraining dogs, saying it would amount to “extreme abuse” to change their mindset. K-9s are rewarded for successfully alerting to the presence of narcotics, and they continue to train regularly with their handlers for a suggested minimum of 16 hours a month. […] Because many K-9s are trained not to be social so their work won’t be affected, Larner said a number of dogs would likely have to be euthanized. We spoke with representatives of two major police forces in jurisdictions that have experienced the legalization of marijuana — the Denver Police Department and the Seattle Police Department — and both vigorously disputed the argument presented by Buffett and Lerner. On the claim that these animals are “trained not to be social” and therefore unable to be cared for after their service, a spokesperson for the Denver PD told us via e-mail that their dogs are not trained against being social: We actually want them to be people friendly, it puts people at ease around the dogs and this leads to more effective deployments. We have had instances where our handlers are a little too friendly with the dogs while they are at home, and this can impact effectiveness. The reason is, that the dog should see going to work as being their play time. To them, finding drugs is the same as playing fetch, if they play too much at home, they slack off at work. The notion that these dogs would have to be euthanized because they would not be social enough to find a home in retirement was equally confounding to the Seattle PD, in part because the dogs (in both Seattle and Denver and elsewhere) live full time with their handlers, and continue to do so after their retirement. Seattle PD spokesman Sean Whitcomb spoke to us by phone, telling us, “That’s nonsense. The dogs that we would retire would stay with the handler.” The idea that the dogs would require active retraining, or would need to be relieved of service if the law changed, is also disputed by both departments. The Denver PD told us they still retain dogs that had been trained prior to legalization: We can only speak to what we do at the Denver Police Department. We do not euthanize our dogs, we would never do that. When [Marijuana, MJ] was first legalized we continued to have our dogs trained on 4 odors: MJ, cocaine, Meth, and heroin. Once a dog is trained on an odor, it is very difficult to train them off of it. We continued to utilize these dogs because we still have a booming black market for MJ. We did begin training with larger amounts of marijuana (10 or more pounds). As these dogs have been retired (they usually stay with their police handlers and become their family pets) we purchased new dogs, a couple of these dogs have not been trained on MJ. So right now we have some dogs on MJ and some dogs off of MJ. This works for us depending on the type of investigation we are conducting. Whitcomb, who described the arguments presented by the Macon County Sheriff as “absurd,” told us — similarly — that the Seattle PD does not “retrain” their dogs either, and that they remain part of their force: When we transitioned from illegal marijuana to legal marijuana some years ago, we didn’t turn over or transition our canine dogs. What we did was discontinue the use of marijuana as a training aid. […] We continued to train our narcotics detection dogs with things like heroin, meth, cocaine. […] That’s what they live for. They got a reward when they successfully find what they’re trained to find, what they’re trained to do, and so when you stop rewarding for hunting marijuana it ceases over time to be a skill. One factual complication, to which Buffett alluded, is that a dog previously trained to sniff marijuana (along with other major drugs) may complicate legal efforts to prosecute people individuals caught carrying legal weed in addition to illegal drugs. The argument is that (legal) marijuana may be what a dog is indicating to the police, who would then use that information to justify a search leading to arrest of an individual for possession of another drug. This argument is especially relevant to California, which recently legalized recreational marijuana through Proposition 64: Prop. 64, which made it legal for individuals to use marijuana and grow it for personal use, specifically states that legal amounts of marijuana and cannabis products don’t create the basis for a search, detention or arrest: A dog that alerts on marijuana could taint an otherwise lawful search that turns up illegal guns or other contraband. “There’s a strong argument that if one of these four-odor dogs smells something, it violates the statute,” [Lauren Mendelsohn, a criminal defense attorney who specializes in cannabis law] said. “It will be interesting to see how it plays out in court.”",1
"The release makes no mention of the cost for an additional genetic test. The news release states there is a benefit to having a genetic test in addition to the standard Gleason score and PSA tests. However, as discussed under the “Evidence” section, there is no data giving us any idea of the differences in accuracy or improved outcomes if patients undergo genetic testing. The main potential harm from the test is risk misclassification (which could happen when the gene tests are applied in a larger, unselected population) resulting in either under- or over-treatment of prostate cancer. This is not addressed in the news release. The release includes an overview of the evidence from the cited research study but doesn’t provide details on how adding a genetic test helps oncologists target treatment and improve outcomes. The study, which carefully selected a small group of patients, looked only at biochemical recurrence–which is only a weak surrogate for prostate cancer mortality. The news release fails to indicate whether the new gene tests are significantly more accurate than current clinical/pathological markers and does not indicate that biochemical progression does not necessarily herald clinical progression or mortality. The statistics provided about prostate cancer are close to what the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have published on their websites. However, the headline for the release — “Are you at risk?” — seems to be blatantly exploiting the results of a preliminary research study to create worry. In addition, men with a family history of prostate cancer should do more than consult Dr. Samadi for a baseline PSA test as suggested by the news release — they should engage in shared decision-making with their provider about their options. This release isn’t hiding any conflicts since it is openly sponsored and released by the prostate cancer specialist named. However, it almost appears as though the author hijacked a recent study about prostate cancer genetics in order to sell the physician’s services to concerned patients. Details about the study itself are minimal. The release states that genetic testing is more accurate in predicting prostate cancer progression than either the PSA or Gleason score, but doesn’t tell us how much more or accurate or how outcomes may be improved other than a vague statement about targeting and individualized treatment. We can’t be sure if the testing protocol discussed in the release is available or not. One might reasonably assume that genetic cancer screening for the five identified genetic types of prostate cancer is available at the specialist’s hospital. However, the release isn’t clear on this point. The findings reported in the study seem to be newsworthy, and we’ll give credit for indicating that “new research has revealed” and “this discovery” as establishing novelty. There’s also a nod to previous research about prostate cancer genetics. The news release makes several leaps intended to drive readers to think there’s something notable being offered, but there’s little hard evidence provided to back up the claims. One example: “If five types of the disease exist, how does this change popular medical opinion on prostate cancer screening? This may mean that each type of the disease needs its own approach to screening, diagnosis, treatment and even recurrence,” noted Dr. Samadi. This is misleading, since the test has no effect on screening and cannot be used to diagnose cancer (you still need a biopsy); it might lead to different treatment and surveillance strategies.",1
"""U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, who’s also a doctor, is aiming his scalpel at a lesser-known provision of last year’s health care overhaul. The Marietta Republican recommends swift removal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was created to rein in growing Medicare costs. Gingrey, an obstetrician-gynecologist, wants the board repealed. He said at a recent news conference it’s worse than tossing Granny off Stone Mountain. """"Democrats like to picture us as pushing Grandmother over the cliff or throwing someone under the bus. In either one of those scenarios, at least the senior has a chance to survive,"""" Gingrey said June 22. """"But under this IPAB we described that the Democrats put in Obamacare, where a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy, I guarantee you, when you withdraw that, the patient is going to die,"""" said Gingrey. """"It’s rationing."""" What a bleak prognosis. Under the IPAB, does """"a bunch of bureaucrats"""" really """"decide whether you get care""""? PolitiFact Georgia asked a Gingrey spokeswoman for proof, but she did not provide any. We turned to four health care policy experts with differing opinions on the IPAB. They all told us that Gingrey was wrong. But before we explain their reasoning, here’s more about the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Lawmakers created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare, the federal program that provides health care for seniors. Under the health care reform bill, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time frame, it is automatically implemented. Both sides of the aisle have their problems with the board. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule IPAB recommendations, or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, Republicans such as Gingrey and even Democrats have signed on to repeal the board. This brings us back to Gingrey’s claim that under the IPAB, """"a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy."""" Gingrey is """"not even close to correct,"""" said Michael Tanner, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute. He opposes the IPAB. """"It [IPAB] has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals,"""" Tanner said. Experts agree that the IPAB has no say in whether a specific person receives dialysis, chemotherapy or any other such treatment. The board does not intercede in individual patient cases. It makes broad policy decisions that affect Medicare’s overall cost. Furthermore, the IPAB is barred from making policy recommendations that would block patients from receiving needed care, experts told PolitiFact Georgia. """"The legislation explicitly forbids the board from rationing care,"""" said Stuart Guterman, a health policy expert with the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan group which works to improve health care access, quality and efficiency. Guterman said he thinks the IPAB can help with health care savings. Our analysis of the bill only found language designed to avoid the result Gingrey foretells. For instance, the IPAB may not submit """"any recommendation to ration health care,"""" Section 3403 states. The same section also bars raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, as well as increasing deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue, either. The IPAB can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions, or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing. If Medicare reimbursements for chemotherapy drop too low, doctors might stop treating Medicare patients, or avoid recommending chemotherapy. But this is not the scenario that Gingrey describes. Gingrey makes no mention of indirect or long-term consequences. He says that with the IPAB, """"a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy. I guarantee you, when you withdraw that, the patient is going to die."""" In other words, Gingrey says that bureaucrats will have the power to deny you treatment. And because of the bureaucrats, you could die. This claim is incorrect. The IPAB does not have anything close to the power that Gingrey suggests. It cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying lifesaving care. The claim is also outrageous. A policy board is not deadlier than pushing Grandma off a cliff. We diagnose Dr. Gingrey with a not-quite-fatal case of .""",1
"""The day after a man with a semiautomatic rifle killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at a gay nightclub, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton renewed her call for a federal ban on assault weapons. On the same day, June 13, 2016, Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson responded to an interviewer’s question about the Orlando incident by stating: """"Assault rifles already are banned."""" So, are they prohibited in the United States, or not? It depends on what assault means. But Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is off-target in suggesting there is a blanket ban on assault rifles. Johnson’s claim Johnson was interviewed by Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, who asked: """"Should we be more concerned with the possible violation of Omar Mateen's Second Amendment rights, as opposed to the constitutional rights of the 50 people who are now dead?"""" Mateen, who was shot dead in the club by police after the rampage, had been armed with a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle and a 9mm handgun. (Orlando police officials initially said Mateen used an """"AR-15-type assault rifle."""" Both an AR-15 and the Sig MCX can fire the same type of ammunition at roughly the same speeds, are aesthetically similar and equally lethal, according to the Washington Post. The manufacturer describes the Sig MCX as """"the first true mission-adaptable weapon system."""") Johnson answered Sykes’ question by saying: """"That's that delicate balance, Charlie. And that's what we need to have an honest and legitimate conversation about, as opposed to leaping to conclusions. """"To say things like we've got to ban assault rifles. Well, assault rifles already are banned. OK? So, we need to actually have an honest discussion about these issues and understand that this is very difficult, very complex."""" One thing to understand up front is the difference between automatic and semiautomatic weapons. Automatic weapons -- banned Automatic weapons -- sometimes known as fully automatic, or machine guns -- fire continuously when the trigger is held down. Two federal laws have essentially banned them in the United States. One law in 1935 all but banned automatic weapons like the Tommy gun. And another in 1986 prohibited fully automatic weapons, except for pre-existing weapons that were grandfathered in. Semiautomatic weapons -- not banned Semiautomatic weapons, like the rifle Mateen carried, reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed. They are not banned by federal law. From 1994 to 2004, there was a federal law that banned the sale of certain types of new semiautomatic weapons, including some types of AR-15 rifles. A limit on high-capacity magazines also was set. The law, which was adopted to last for 10 years, was not renewed by Congress when it expired. The takeaway Johnson takes the position that only automatic weapons qualify as assault weapons. It’s worth noting that in at least one other interview the same day — with conservative Green Bay radio talk show host Jerry Bader — he spelled that out, saying """"an assault weapon is a fully automatic."""" His office made the same argument to us, citing technical military definitions. However, that’s not a generally accepted line of separation. The federal law that became defunct in 2004 was called the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and at the time the Department of Justice defined some semiautomatic guns as assault weapons. A number of state laws still have that wording on their books. And law enforcement agencies consider certain semiautomatic weapons, including the one used by Mateen, as assault weapons — or at minimum, assault-style weapons. Indeed, the weapons used in the mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. -- all of which were semiautomatic -- were all described by police as assault rifles. Our rating In the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, in which the killer used a semiautomatic rifle was used, Johnson stated: """"Assault rifles already are banned."""" Some, including Johnson, contend that only weapons that are automatic — firing continuously when the trigger is held down are assault weapons — are assault weapons. Those are essentially prohibited by federal laws. But that definition is narrow, and Johnson’s claim gives a misleading impression of a comprehensive ban. Lawmakers, law enforcement officials and others widely refer to many semiautomatic weapons like the rifle used in Orlando and other mass shootings — which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed — as assault weapons. Those are not banned by federal law. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is .""",1
"We first encountered this story in April 2004 when it began to land in the snopes.com inbox. It has since come to us labeled “News from Egypt,” “Miracle in Egypt,” and “Murder Miracle in Egypt!” The story, as appealing as it may be, appears to have nothing to it. Despite the tale’s claim that “The country is outraged over the incident, and the man will be executed,” we found no news reports from Egypt about a man’s murdering his wife and burying her along with his two still-alive daughters, let alone about the two little girls’ being nurtured below ground by Jesus for 15 days before being rescued from their premature graves: Example:  [Collected via e-mail, May 2004] NEWS FROM EGYPT A Muslim man in Egypt killed his wife and then buried her with their infant baby and 8-year old daughter. The girls were buried alive! He then reported to the police that an uncle killed the kids. 15 days later, another family member died. When they went to bury him, they found the little girls under the sand — ALIVE !! The country is outraged over the incident, and the man will be executed. The older girl was asked how she had survived. “A man wearing shiny white clothes, with bleeding wounds in his hands, came every day to feed us. He woke up my mom so she could nurse my sister,” she said. She was interviewed on Egyptian national TV, by a veiled Muslim woman news anchor. She said on public TV, “This was none other than Jesus, because nobody else does things like this!” Muslims believe Isa (Jesus) would do this, but the wounds mean He really was crucified, and it’s clear also that He is alive! But, it’s also clear that the child could not make up a story like this, and there is no way these children could have survived without a true miracle. Muslim leaders are going to have a hard time to figure out what to do with this, and the popularity of the Passion movie doesn’t help! With Egypt at the center of the media and education in the Middle East, you can be sure this story will spread. Christ is still turning the world upside down! Please let this story be shared here too. The Lord says, “I will bless the person who puts his trust in me.” (Jeremiah 17:7) As to where the story came from, while a number of the forwards identify as the writer of the e-mail a woman whose husband is a Christian pastor who runs a Muslim outreach program in the U.S. (and therefore as the one both providing and vouching for the story), some of the earliest versions that bear her name led off with this now-elided paragraph: I don’t want to wait until our next newsletter to get this story out to you. It begins as a tragedy but ends as an incredible miracle. Victor received this by email a few days ago (5/20/04), and talked with family in Egypt to confirm the details that were given there on the news. A careful reading of that preface provides the information that the putative author did not pen the written account now so often attributed to her — the piece was instead something her husband received from an unnamed source. As for confirming details with family in Egypt, we can only guess what got asked and how it was answered.",1

Adelson vigorously denies those allegations. What does any of that have to do with Rep. Jim Renacci? Even though Federal Election Commission records show that Adelson hasn’t ever donated to Renacci, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tried to use the casino owner’s legal woes against the Medina County congressman with a provocatively titled press release: """"Congressman Renacci’s Re-election Funded by Chinese Prostitution Money?"""" """"Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority,"""" the DCCC claimed in a news release on July 2, 2012. """"What will Congressman Jim Renacci do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?"""" it continued, urging Renacci to """"reject the support of these groups funded by money from a Chinese prostitution strategy."""" As a result of redistricting, Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, Ohio, is pitted against Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat. That makes him a target for the DCCC. The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn’t spent anything so far. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle. The NRCC regularly sends out news releases that attack Sutton, Renacci’s November election rival who is from Copley Township near Akron. When we asked Renacci campaign spokesman James Slepian about the DCCC’s claim that the congressman’s re-election might somehow be funded by Chinese prostitution money, Slepian replied that there is """"no money from Chinese prostitutes, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy in our campaign coffers."""" """"The DCCC's Chinese prostitution fantasy demonstrates that they are now fully immersed in the gutter and will literally say anything to avoid talking about Betty Sutton's lockstep support for the failed Obama economic agenda,"""" Slepian said. """"This campaign needs to be about the economy and voting records, not fairy tales about Chinese hookers."""" The allegations that Adelson signed off on prostitution at his properties in Macau were raised last month during a lawsuit filed by former Sands executive Steven Jacobs, who was fired from overseeing those properties in July 2010. Associated Press reported that Jacobs’ lawsuit accuses Adelson of breach of contract and pushing him into illegal activity. A court filing from Jacobs says he tried to rid the casino floor of """"loan sharks and prostitution"""" while he worked there, which upset senior executives who informed him that """"the prior prostitution strategy had been personally approved by Adelson."""" A spokesman for the Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always """"maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson’s character."""" In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine,  Adelson said there’s not a """"shred of evidence"""" to back his former employee’s charges, and """"says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the … claims even more preposterous."""" Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau. Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson’s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC’s claim that """"foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority?"""" We don’t think so. The root of the allegation stems from a fired employee’s claim that Adelson allowed prostitution to be present in a casino in Macau. Based on that, the DCCC claims that Adelson, one of the wealthiest people in America, made political contributions with cash from prostitution revenues. And then the claim invokes Renacci’s name as part of the Republican majority that this tainted money is supposedly supporting. Renacci hasn’t accepted money from Adelson and doesn’t control contributions to the GOP groups that support him. The claim that Adelson’s donations to these other groups amount to """"Chinese prostitution money"""" is dubious enough that inserting the word """"allegedly"""" can’t save it. On the Truth-O-Meter, the DCCC statement rates .""",1
"Abdel Rehim Saeid, 35, applies the ancient Pharaonic technique, known as the “fiery towel” by starting with a standard massage, using oil and camomile, to stimulate blood circulation and alleviate some of the pain in affected areas. Then comes the heat. Saeid places several layers of towels and other isolating materials on the client’s back. Then a towel soaked in alcohol is placed on top and set on fire. It burns for roughly a minute before the flames are put out with a wet towel. “It is ...called a fiery massage,” Saeid said, that works by sucking moisture out of the body. “I communicate with the human body, coming into close contact with the body of the human in front of me,” he said. Saeid said he cannot use the technique with people suffering from high blood pressure, kidney failure or haemophilia. He said he trained under an expert in the fiery towel technique in Morocco, and had earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. Mohammed al-Shaer, a client in his 30s, said his pain had improved “100%” after the fiery treatment. “Before, I could not stand to pray. I couldn’t stretch my back when I got out of a car,” he said. “Now, after the second session, my body is getting better and my movement is better. I used to be very lazy but this is no longer the case.”",1
"""As part of Congress’ budget debates, Rep. Tim Ryan cautioned against major cuts while the economy is weak, and said he especially opposed cutting funds for Head Start. Head Start is a national program that tries to bolster school readiness through educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families. While interviewing Ryan on Fox News, Greta Van Sustern criticized Head Start because of the academic performance of 8th graders in the Washington, D.C., school system. Ryan defended the program, claiming that """"for every dollar we invest in Head Start, we get $5 to $7 back into our economy."""" That kind of return got our attention, so we decided to follow the statistical threads to see if Ryan’s claim is backed by whole cloth or solid evidence. We started with Ryan’s staff. They cited a paper from 2007 by scholars Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Deborah A. Phillips of Georgetown University, which also alludes to other studies. The researchers conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the program and concluded that that Head Start’s return to taxpayers is greater than their investment in the program. They based their conclusion on studies that compared the performance over decades of siblings who enrolled in Head Start, and siblings that did not, for example. Among their findings: While Head Start doesn’t create jobs itself, children exposed to Head Start are more able to compete for better jobs than those without that exposure, they concluded. The Ludwig-Phillips paper also cited a study of Perry Preschool, an early care and education program in Michigan similar to Head Start, charting the progress of 3- and 4-year-olds through two years, and also examined their success rate through age 40. The researchers did issue a few caveats. Studying program participants over several decades allowed them to follow outcomes into adolescence and adulthood to assess longterm impacts, but they acknowledge that some of the data available to study children from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was limited. Also, Head Start has changed over time, making it a challenge to apply the data to children in the program now. Forecasting outcomes from kids in Head Start now involves use of """"a number of untestable assumptions,"""" they said. Nonetheless, they concluded that with the average cost of Head Start at $9,000 per child, the early education and social intervention programs """"are likely sufficient to generate benefits in excess of costs in both the short- and long-term."""" A letter sent to Congress in March 2011, signed by more than 300 researchers from around the country, also supported the notion that Head Start is cost effective. It cited a $7 to $9 return for every dollar invested in the programs based on the findings of 12 different studies and reports. They estimated that the program’s required medical screenings, vaccinations and emphasis reduced annual Medicaid expenses by $232 per family. And commentary about the scholarly tract by Ludwig and Phillips in a 2007 edition of Social Policy Report suggests that Head Start might have low-balled its own effectiveness. Commentary by W. Steven Barnett of Rutgers University on the Ludwig-Phillips paper cites studies of three different programs similar to Head Start, one of which found a 2.5 to 1 return ($2.50 for each $1), one that estimated a 10.1 to 1 return, and one that noted a 16.1 to 1 return. Each study examined a different public early care and education program and based its findings on myriad categories including earnings by people who went through the programs in early childhood. So how does Ryan’s statement fare on the Truth-O-Meter? The statement is accurate. Numerous studies support the notion that Head Start is cost beneficial. Ryan’s numbers land right in the middle of the cost-benefit estimates. While some are as high as $16.10 for each dollar spent, there are some as low as $2.50. That the researchers caution that forecasting outcomes from kids in Head Start now is difficult is an additional piece of information. While there’s decades of data, programs have also changed over time.""",0
"Demand for plant-based foods is growing fast as consumers worried about the environmental impact of meat production and keen to avoid a meat-heavy diet on health grounds look for alternative protein sources. JUST’s products including JUST Egg, a scrambled egg imitation made from mung beans, are available in the United States, Canada, China and Singapore, with sales evenly split between retailers including Walmart (WMT.N), Safeway and Whole Foods (AMZN.O), and restaurants such as Tim Hortons (QSR.TO). Chief Executive Josh Tetrick said cutting the costs of JUST Egg was key to broader acceptance. It is “really important for us to become one of the lowest cost proteins on the planet,” he said. “Today, our cost is 22 cents per serving. Our goal is to get to 12 cents next year and then ultimately below five.”  The cheapest supermarket eggs from non-caged hens cost around 16 cents each. Tetrick told Reuters that after launching in Europe a next logical step is achieving profitability, in advance of a possible listing to raise money. He has already raised about $250 million from investors around the world, including Mitsui, Temasek, China Construction Bank, Founders Fund, the Benioff family and the Heineken family. Tetrick, whose company employs about 120 people, sees his JUST Egg in European outlets in the next few months. “We will be launching in some locations, retailers and restaurants in Europe,” he said on the sidelines of an event in Zurich last week. Investors are taking notice of the growth in plant-based foods. U.S. startup Beyond Meat’s (BYND.O) stock has nearly tripled since it went public in May even though it is yet to turn a profit. Tetrick said his San Francisco-based company had hired longtime food industry executive Dave Wagstaff, with experience at global giants like McCain and free-range egg brand Happy Egg, to head its European team. “Our partners in Europe today include (Italian egg company) Eurovo, they’re doing the manufacturing and distribution, as well as German poultry group PHW and (online food delivery platform) Delivery Hero (DHER.DE).”  Tetrick said he was confident the company could get a slice of the $260 billion global egg market “if we get it right”. “We figured out the technology, but now we have to execute.”  Tetrick said the company was expecting low- to mid-double- digit million dollar revenues this year and should multiply sales by around seven next year. “Our most important financial objective is operating profitability,” he said. “We’ll get there some time in the next year.”",0
"""Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee supports the federal government cutting off more than $500 million to Planned Parenthood, calling the organization """"an industry of abortion"""" in a recent Fox Business Channel interview. His interviewer, Fox Business reporter Sandra Smith, did not disagree — and she offered numbers to back up her point. """"Almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions,"""" Smith said as she guest-hosted Mornings with Maria on July 28, 2015. We wanted to know if the percentage of abortions was really that high. We reached out to Smith for comment but did not hear back. 'Pregnancy services' Viewers may miss that Smith’s statement refers only to """"pregnancy services."""" By choosing those words, she is likely referencing a fact sheet by the Susan B. Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates. The Susan B. Anthony List’s numbers derive from Planned Parenthood’s 2013-14 annual report. The first caveat to know is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for """"pregnancy services."""" That’s a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly misleading claims over the years. On the fact sheet, """"pregnancy services"""" are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy. With that in mind, here’s the section from Planned Parenthood’s annual report that contains those categories. To arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements from the chart: prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653). Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories. For several reasons, that’s a misleading way to analyze the data. Referrals for prenatal care not in equation Not all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700 clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood's focus. As a result, many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care. How many? It's impossible to know. Planned Parenthood does not record how many pregnant patients are referred to outside health care providers, said Elizabeth Clark, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. If referrals were included, the 95 percent figure would likely change, though we can't say by how much — and neither can Smith nor the Susan B. Anthony List. The rest of the story Planned Parenthood does not specifically track of the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for other reasons. And many of Planned Parenthood's services are not related to prenatal care, abortion or adoption. Testing and treatment for sexually transmitted disease and infection, both for men and women, accounts for the largest share of services provided by Planned Parenthood at more than 4.47 million. Contraception, which includes birth control, emergency contraception kits, and sterilization and vasectomy procedures, accounts for more than 3.58 million services. Different types of cancer screening and prevention, including breast exams, account for 935,573 services. As show on the chart above, there were also more than 1.1 million pregnancy tests, 47,2000 urinary tract infection treatments, or 65,500 """"family practice services."""" Over the course of 2013-14, Planned Parenthood performed more than 10.5 million services. Sometimes patients are double-counted because they receive multiple services. Put another way. Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year. Of all services, abortions account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to page 18 of the report. But looking at the share of abortions per patient (and assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to 12 percent. Some critics have taken issue with Planned Parenthood’s measurement of """"services."""" Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used. (However, that information is not in the 2013-14 annual report.) Our ruling Smith said, """"Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood's) pregnancy services were abortions."""" An anti-abortion group puts the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood's services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes """"pregnancy services"""" as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant. But Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information. What's most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals. Planned Parenthood says it doesn't keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers. Without that information, we don't know an accurate percentage of """"pregnancy services"""" that were abortions. Neither, however, does Smith. UPDATE: After this fact-check published, an official with Planned Parenthood contacted us and said that she was not authorized to speak on the record. A spokeswoman who is authorized to speak on the record, Elizabeth Clark, then provided us the same information. We've updated this fact-check to include her comments.""",1
"The headline says “Prozac Failed Anorexic Women in Study,” so the story is not advocating fluoxetine as a treatment for anorexia. So, while the average cost of the drug is not mentioned, it is also not crucial in a story with this angle. The story provides absolute numbers of patients who completed the study and maintained their weight. The story also notes that the difference between the treatment group and the placebo group was not statistically significant and that there was no apparent benefit from this treatment. The story does not mention that these patients were recruited from eating disorders treatment centers and had anorexia for several years (average 4 years). This was also a small study, with less than half of the patients completing treatment, so the results may not be generalizable, especially for patients at earlier and less acute stages of anorexia. The story mentions that one teenage study participant attempted suicide. Adolescent suicide has been linked to certain anti-depressant medications, including fluoxetine. No other harms or side effects of the drug are mentioned. Even though the source journal article did not list negative side effects of fluoxetine, that doesn’t remove the obligation to discuss these as part of a complete and balanced story. The story partially describes the study design, but it does not mention that it was a double-blind, randomized study. The story presents some quantitative information on how many women completed the year-long study and how many maintained their weight during that time. The story does not mention that of the 49 assigned to fluoxetine, only 7 achieved a full recovery from anorexia. The story mentions that the difference between the people who took fluoxetine and those who took the placebo was not statistically significant. There is no evidence of disease mongering. The story provide prevalence statistics from The National Eating Disorders Association. The story provides several sources of information from researchers and clinicians not affiliated with the study. The story also noted that the lead author receives funding from Eli Lily, maker of fluoxetine, and that this company provided medication for the study. The story mentions behavioral treatment for anorexia and mentions that the study participants received psychotherapy (in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy) and medication. The story says, “Prozac is one of the antidepressants often used to treat anorexia.” Fluoxetine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of bulimia, but not anorexia. Use in clinical settings is off-label and typically for co-existing depression or obsessive compulsive disorder, for which fluoxetine is approved. Fluoxetine has been effective in treating symptoms of bulimia nervosa, but not anorexia. The story mentions that Prozac (fluoxetine) is used to treat anorexia, but this is an off-label use, which is not mentioned. This is an important fact. The medication is more commonly prescribed to treat depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, often co-existing mental illnesses in patients with anorexia. This story reported the effect of fluoxetine specifically on symptoms of anorexia. There is no evidence that this story relied solely or largely on a news release.",0
"""Like other groups criticizing health care reform, the conservative Club for Growth is using the August recess to try to stop the congressional effort to create a government-run health insurance option. Part of the Club's strategy will include a $1.2 million ad campaign aimed at Democrats who may be wavering about the plan. In the ad, a man weeps over someone lying in a hospital bed while the announcer says, """"$22,750. In England, government health officials decided that's how much six months of life is worth. Under their socialized system if a medical treatment costs more, you're out of luck. That's wrong for America."""" That footage is interspersed with shots of the Capitol building and the whole thing is set to some very ominous music. You can watch it  here. The carefully worded ad doesn't directly say that the government is planning to put a price on our lives, but the implication is clear: The reform plan will lead to callous decisions that would allow people to die if they face a costly treatment. So that's what we're going to check — whether the reform plan would impose those kind of caps on treatment. At its heart, the Club for Growth's ad criticizes a medical approach known as comparative effectiveness research, which aims to find the most effective treatments for the lowest cost. Such research became a flashpoint during the stimulus debate, when the Conservatives for Patients Rights portrayed the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research, a new board created by the stimulus bill to find the best health treatments, as being modeled after the British system. In fact, the board is very different from the British system, where government entities run the health care system and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence — NICE for short — determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. The stimulus emphasized that the board is not meant to """"mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer"""" and that none of the board's reports or recommendations """"shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment."""" So we gave the Conservatives for Patients Rights claim a  Barely True  . Once again, some Republicans have started linking the general premise of comparative effectiveness and what NICE does in Britain to describe how a government-run plan in the United States would discriminate against people who are older or very sick. Here's one such comment:     """"I don't know for sure, but I've heard several senators say that Ted Kennedy with a brain tumor, being 77 years old as opposed to being 37 years old, if he were in England, would not be treated for his disease, because end of life — when you get to be 77, your life is considered less valuable under those systems,"""" said Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, in a news conference with reporters. NICE is an element in the Club for Growth ad as well. The ad refers to a December 2008 article in the  New York Times  that followed the case of Bruce Hardy, a British man who was denied a $54,000 drug by British health authorities. The article said the drug could have delayed his cancer progression for six months. Under NICE policies, the government would only pay about 15,000 pounds — or $22,750 — to save six months of Hardy's life. (NICE's limits are well known and have been widely discussed in the medical community.) The agency generally considers treatments cost-effective if they are less than $34,000 a year, according to an article in the  New England Journal of Medicine. But sometimes the agency will accept treatments that cost far more than that. So the Club for Growth's claim that NICE has a price limit of $22,750 for six months of life is roughly accurate, said Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that is often in step with the Club for Growth. But """"does the (Obama health care) legislation say it's going to do what Britain is doing? The answer to that is no,"""" said Cannon. Nevertheless, Cannon doesn't believe that the ad is too far off, pointing to a proposal by the White House that would create an independent group of health experts that would look for inefficiencies in Medicare coverage. """"With the government assuming an even larger majority in health spending, it becomes very hard to argue that they won't have to ration... [Club for Growth] is implying that this is where it would lead and that's valid."""" But at this point, that proposal is not included in either the House or the Senate bill, so we believe it's quite a stretch for the Club for Growth to suggest it would be part of the health reform plan. Dr. Sean Tunis, a former top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under the Bush administration and current director of the Center for Medical Technology Policy, says the ad is misleading. """"We have a public plan now, and that's Medicare,"""" Tunis said. """"And Medicare doesn't put a price on life. ... That seems like a fallacious connection to me."""" The only initiative from the Obama administration along those lines is the increase in funding for comparative effectiveness research through the stimulus. That data would be used to help doctors and patients make better drug and procedure decisions, not dictate treatment, he said. So, back to the Club for Growth ad. Although our experts agree that it gets the NICE statistic correct about the British practice, the ad's main point about cost limits is incorrect. There is no such practice in the comparative effectiveness program, nor is it part of the current health reform proposals pending in Congress. The House and Senate bills under consideration would not require the government to decide how much a person's life is worth. As a result, we give the Club for Growth a .""",1
"On 21 April 2016, the web site Empire Herald published an article reporting that a 61-year-old (“caucasian”) man from North Carolina had killed himself upon learning that a portrait of 19th century African-American abolitionist Harriet Tubman was to replace that of Andrew Jackson on the front of the U.S. $20 bill, writing in his suicide note that he hoped Donald Trump would be elected to “make America white again”: Gary-Jo Henderson, 61, of Charlotte was known by friends and family as a hardcore American currency collector. His wife, Martha Henderson is a collector of Civil War memorabilia. Both traveled acrossed the country to buy and auction off their historical collections. According to reports, Mrs. Henderson arrived at their residence at approximately 6:15 P.M. when she discovered her husband, unresponsive in his home office. Mrs. Henderson immediately called 911 while attempting to resuscitate her husband. According to Mrs. Henderson, “After I found my husband slumped over in his chair, I ran over to him to see if he was okay. When he did not respond to me, I checked to see if he was sleeping and that is when I saw that he was not breathing. I called 911 and I tried to give him CPR until the ambulance arrived. After a few attempts, I notice an empty bottle of Percocets on his desk. I then saw a note near the bottle which read’Make American White Again’. When I opened the letter, that is when I found out he committed suicide. … Reportedly, part of the letter read, ‘It’s a shame that one of our founding fathers is being replaced by a N**GER.

"""Public health’s focus on HIV/AIDS typically tilts toward men. That’s because men who have sex with men still face the greatest risk of getting the disease and represent most new cases. But out of the spotlight, how are women faring? """"HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin,"""" Austin City Council Member Ora Houston told council colleagues Sept. 8, 2015, """"and we need to do some specific targeting for that."""" Houston, who represents District 1, sought an additional  $150,000 in spending in the 2015-16 budget year for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department’s HIV/AIDS initiatives. Houston’s ask was made in the context of bolstering efforts aimed at improving the quality of life of African-Americans in Austin, an initiative the city launched several years ago. The proposal didn’t win council approval, although the department drew a 16-percent surge in its overall budget. Also, it turns out, Houston wasn’t right about HIV and AIDS among Austin women """"skyrocketing."""" Yet for decades and across the nation, African-Americans have been the racial group hardest hit--with black women the most disproportionately affected. It’s a wide gap that similarly persists in Travis County. Houston says she misspoke Houston, asked how she reached her """"skyrocketing"""" declaration, told us by phone she misspoke. """"The larger issue is what do we do to save the women in my community infected with HIV/AIDS,"""" she said. Some background: In Travis County, fewer than one in 10 residents is black, but more than one in five of the 4,401 residents living with HIV at the end of 2014 was black, according to health department data. Also that year, nearly 711 in every 100,000 black females living in the county, or 318 individuals, had the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. That was double the number of Hispanic females (156) and nearly triple the number of white females (109) living with HIV. From another vantage point, the rate of black females living with HIV in Travis County was over 17 times higher than the rate for white females and nearly nine times higher than the rate for Hispanic females. There were still many more men, of all races, with HIV. The rate of black males living in the county with HIV was 1,589.4 per 100,000 in 2014, reflecting 670 individuals. The rates were 634.9 for white males (1,743 people) and 617.8 for Hispanic males (1,235 individuals). Put another way, the rate of black males living with HIV/AIDS in Travis County was 2.5 times higher than the rate for white or Hispanic males. A national pattern The disparity in rates of African American women getting infected with HIV or diagnosed with AIDS, which has deepened since the epidemic began, is rooted in a variety of factors, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health. A key factor is poverty, which is more widespread in the African-American community and can result in less access to care and, often, a failure to know one’s HIV status. Also, the office says, because African-Americans tend to have sex with partners of the same race, and because the disease is higher in that population, their risk of getting HIV is greater. """"Stigma, fear, discrimination, homophobia and negative perceptions about HIV testing can also place too many African-American women at higher risk,"""" the Office on Women’s Health says. """"Many at risk for infection fear stigma more than infection. They may choose instead to hide their high-risk behavior rather than get counseling and testing."""" No skyrocket among Travis County women In Travis County, annual diagnoses of HIV and AIDS for women mostly declined from 2005 through 2014, health department figures show. Most recently, 4 in 100,000 female residents in the county were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2014 compared to an average 6.1 incidence rate from 2005 through 2013. The AIDS incidence rate for all women in the county was 1.9 per 100,000 women in 2014 compared to an average 4.3 rate from 2005 through 2013. Women of all races represented a small number of Travis County residents diagnosed with HIV in 2014: just 23 of the 244 cases. Also in 2014, 98 Travis County residents, including 11 females, were diagnosed with full-blown AIDS. We did not learn how many black females fell into these categories. Health department staff epidemiologist Jeff Taylor advised us by phone that because very few women are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS each year, the department doesn't publicly release raw numbers based on by race and ethnicity. """"Some of those numbers may be one, two, three or four, and people get concerned about confidentiality,"""" Taylor said. We were, however, able to compare rates among racial and ethnic groups for a decade. Each year, from 2005 through 2014, the rates of HIV and AIDS among African-American males and females in Travis County was higher than the rates among Hispanics and whites. The far higher rates in black females, when compared to Hispanic and white females, are """"startling,"""" Shannon Jones III, director of the city/county health department, said at a recent conference on health disparities. Then again, the data show a 27 percent drop in new HIV diagnoses for black females between 2013 and 2014, though there was an increase in AIDS diagnoses; the incidence of 16 black females per 100,000 black women was up from 12.3 in 2013. Between 2013 and 2014, HIV rates also fell for white females but ticked up among Hispanic females from 3.2 per 100,000 in 2013 to 3.7 per 100,000 in 2014. New diagnoses of HIV are the best barometer of how the disease is trending in a community, Taylor said. Between 2005 and 2014, the rate of new HIV infections for black females in the county ranged from a high of 42.9 per 100,000 black women in 2006 to a low of 19.4 in 2011. Our ruling Houston said HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin. That’s not so. While black women have persistently been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS at higher rates than other women, HIV/AIDS incidence rates for Travis County women declined for most of the past decade. The statement is not accurate.""",1
"The research findings from Washington State’s King County, which includes the city of Seattle, add to a growing body of data on how such disclosures, meant to curb the U.S. obesity epidemic, may influence dining habits. The study was based on surveys of more than 3,000 King County residents who frequent chain restaurant. It began eight months before the county required restaurants to post calorie information at the beginning of 2009, and continued for two years after that. Women, higher-income individuals and diners who ate at fast-food chains said they were the most likely to use the information. White, higher-income and obese customers were more likely to see the calorie information. Researchers did not ask how diners put calorie information to use. “It was a confirmation that if you post calorie information, more people are going to see it and more people are going to use it,” said Roxana Chen, lead author and social research scientist for public health for Seattle and King County. The study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and published online by the American Journal of Public Health. Chen said the latest study builds on related RWJF-funded research published in 2013. In that study, researchers examined receipts from more than 7,300 King County restaurant customers and found that patrons, particularly women, who saw the calorie counts purchased fewer calories than those who did not. King County was the second U.S. jurisdiction, after New York City, to implement a calorie counts under a menu-labeling law.",0
"Cost is not particularly relevant in this case. No adequate explanation was given of the measurement of how “pain was reduced” and no quantification was given of the degree of reduction nor of how many of the 143 study participants experienced what degree of pain relief. Not applicable;  we don’t know what harm could come from attempts at music therapy The story was taken directly from a news release, spewing exactly what was said in the news release and no more. There was no critical analysis. There was no independent perspective evaluating the finding. The story was unclear about whether pain or anxiety was the dominant issue. The story also did not explain that shocking volunteers is not the same as studying patients with a clinical pain condition. Not applicable. Readers weren’t told anything about what kind of pain – from what conditions – the study participants were experiencing. Point of clarification: It’s not clear that these participants were suffering from any kind of pain other than the shocks provided by the investigators. They’re described as “volunteers.” The story lists a news release as its source and it’s clear this was its only source. Feels like holiday-week filler material. No comparison was made with any other known method of pain relief. Then again, as already stated, we don’t know anything about the pain these study participants had, so the entire story is void of vital information. We’re going to rule this unsatisfactory because we’re not told what kind of music was used (couldn’t that be an important variable? ), nor for how long study participants were exposed, nor the setting (home? research setting?) – nothing that could address the potential availability of this approach. Music therapy has been studied for decades across a range of conditions. The story didn’t even acknowledge any past research in any other field. The story admits that an American Pain Society news release was its sole source.",1
"""The story didn’t mention costs, which is somewhat understandable given the early phase of research. But the competing USA Today story, while noting that drug pricing hasn’t been set, at least noted that many new cancer therapies """"cost $5,000 to $7,000 a month."""" This story should have done something like that as well. The story does a good job of quantifying the benefits. It explained that 81% of patients had a partial response, meaning some shrinkage of the tumor, and gives the absolute number of people this represents. It also explains that the drug is effective in only the 50% of advanced melanoma patients with a specific genetic mutation. Although it cautions that a """"sizable proportion"""" of patients developed resistance to the drug, we wish it had been a bit more precise in its characterization of this problem. There was no discussion of harms in this story — somewhat shocking when you consider that safety assessment is the primary objective of phase I research. The suggestion that this drug may substantially increase the risk of another, less invasive type of skin cancer, certainly warrants some attention. The accompanying editorial in the NEJM commented: """"Overall, PLX4032 had moderate toxicity, with rash of grade 2 or 3, fatigue, and arthralgia being the major dose-limiting toxic effects. Somewhat unexpectedly, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas developed in a significant percentage of patients."""" This story gave a lucid account of the research and communicated some of its key limitations. It noted that the dramatic results of this small study of very sick patients may not be generalizable to the broader population of individuals with melanoma. It also pointed out uncertainty regarding how long the drug will remain effective. No disease-mongering here. The story quotes a dermatologist with no links to the research. Not coincidentally, she is the only person in any of the three stories we reviewed about this study to point out the lack of conclusive data on survival. The story also notes that the trial was funded by drug maker Roche. The story notes that only about 15% of patients respond to the standard treatments for metastatic melanoma — chemotherapy and interleukin-2. But it veers into questionable territory when it allows an expert to claim that """"the best defense against melanoma is to get your skin examined regularly by a professional who knows what to look for."""" In fact, recent guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force conclude that there is insufficient evidence to tell if regular screening helps prevent deaths from skin cancer. A thorough discussion of this issue would have included an opposing comment about the uncertainty of the evidence. The story specifies that the new drug is """"experimental"""" and in phase 1 clinical research. Readers can conclude from this that the drug is not widely available. The story describes the research that led to the development of the new drug. By all accounts the drug does represent a novel and exciting approach to the treatment of metastatic melanoma. We feel pretty confident that this story didn’t rely on a news release.""",0
"""(Published Sept. 11, 2008) John McCain released an ad this week making the accusation that Barack Obama supports sex education for five-year-olds. Here's what the ad says: """"  Education Week  says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' that he's 'elusive' on accountability, a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.' """"Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners. """"Learning about sex before learning to read? Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family."""" Here, we'll check the claim that Obama wants five-year-olds to learn about sex. We've checked what  Education Week  said in a separate item and found it  Barely True  . The origins of this claim go back to Obama's days as a state senator in the Illinois General Assembly. In 2003, the Assembly considered a bill to expand sex education directives from grades 6 through 12 to grades K through 12. The legislation required the curriculum to be medically accurate and include information on the prevention of HIV and contraceptives. It also said abstinence must be taught and that students """"shall be encouraged to base their actions on reasoning, self-discipline, sense of responsibility, self-control, and ethical considerations, such as respect for oneself and others."""" Most pertinent to the kindergarten allegation, the legislation states that """"course material and instruction shall be age and developmentally appropriate."""" Carol Ronen, the now-retired state senator who sponsored the bill, said its main intent was to make sure that teenagers got information that was """"medically accurate,"""" a requirement that wasn't then part of the school code. A secondary effect was to expand age-appropriate sex education down to lower grades, to allow things like teaching school children to avoid sex predators, Ronen said. """"Barack never had anything to do with it,"""" she said. """"This is a lot of hoopla."""" Obama voted for the legislation in committee on a party-line vote. He was not a sponsor nor a co-sponsor, and the legislation never made it to a full Senate vote. So calling it one of his accomplishments is wrong, since it never became law and it wasn't his bill anyway. This isn't the first time Obama has faced the """"sex ed for kindergartners"""" charge. When Obama ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, his opponent Alan Keyes used it. """"Nobody's suggesting that kindergartners are going to be getting information about sex in the way that we think about it,"""" Obama said at a campaign event in 2004. """"If they ask a teacher 'where do babies come from,' that providing information that the fact is that it's not a stork is probably not an unhealthy thing. Although again, that's going to be determined on a case-by-case basis by local communities and local school boards."""" Obama said that he did not support telling youngsters about explicit information about sex. The bill specifically mentions that instructional material must be age appropriate. It specifically mentions teaching children how to """"say no to unwanted sexual advances"""" and """"nonconsensual physical sexual contact."""" The legislation was not sponsored by Obama and it didn't pass, so calling it one of his """"accomplishments"""" is absurd. We rate this claim !""",1
"""Since the shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, on Nov. 5, 2009, we've been inundated with e-mails about a purported link between President Barack Obama's administration and Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist suspected of the shootings. Here are a few lines from one of the many versions of the e-mail we received:     """"It’s been a pretty incredible week and I don’t mean in a good way. But today we have been given a glimpse into the New World Order and it’s pretty scary,"""" the e-mail begins. After complaining that Obama is pursuing a Muslim agenda, the e-mail says, """"Did you know that Major Hassan was an ADVISOR to the Obama Administration? No? Neither did I until my wife found information on line and followed the evidence to the source documents!"""" Our friends over at National Public Radio  already checked out  a version of this claim. The rumor, NPR concluded, started with Jerome Corsi, a writer for World Net Daily and author of  The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality  . The e-mails we were sent linked to the Corsi story as well. """"Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the alleged shooter in yesterday's massacre at Fort Hood, played a homeland security advisory role in President Barack Obama's transition into the White House, according to a key university policy institute document,"""" Corsi wrote. (We've checked  three Corsi claims  before and rated two False and one .) The story links to a document published by the George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., titled """"Thinking Anew—Security Priorities for the Next Administration."""" It is the proceedings from a series of meetings of the organization's Presidential Task Force. On page 29 of the paper, Hasan is listed as a participant; he was one of more than 300 officials, reporters and Capitol Hill aides who signed up for the conference. In a statement, the think tank confirmed that the Hasan listed as a participant is the same Hasan accused of the Fort Hood shootings. But the statement also makes an important point: Hasan registered for the event on his own. He was not invited, and he attended only as an audience member in his capacity as a psychiatry fellow at the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine. """"All of these events were open to the public,"""" the statement reads. """"At no time has Nidal Hasan been affiliated with [the Homeland Security Policy Institute] or The George Washington University."""" So, Hasan chose to attend a conference relevant to his field, much like a doctor would attend a conference about diabetes, for example. But here's the more important point: The task force has nothing to do with the White House, according to Sharon Cardash, associate director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute. """"HSPI's Presidential Transition Task Force is not and was not affiliated at all with the White House,"""" she wrote us in an e-mail. """"The Task Force was created prior to the election; and was not formed at the request of any administration."""" Indeed, HSPI established the transition task force in April 2008, before Obama was in office, let alone the Democratic presidential nominee. In a city where policy papers are published nearly every day, the work done by the group no more advised the Obama administration than any of the other papers that came out before or after GWU's. Corsi actually makes this point farther down in his story, which contradicts his headline: """"While the GWU task force participants included several members of government, including representatives of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there is no indication in the document that the group played any formal role in the official Obama transition, other than to serve in a university-based advisory capacity."""" And in an editor's note to the story, Corsi writes that, """"Hasan is being reported as a participant in the GWU Homeland Security Policy Institute's Presidential Transition Task Force, not as a member, noting the group was a university think-tank, not part of the Obama administration official transition team."""" But it appears that disclaimer came later, and that it failed to stop the avalanche of e-mails spreading the inaccurate report. Hasan attended a meeting on a subject relevant to his profession, that much is clear. But beyond that, there's nothing to back up the chain e-mail's accusation that he somehow was """"an ADVISOR"""" to the Obama administration or that GWU's task force was involved in the new White House. In fact, the group's work began long before Obama took office and is in no way affiliated with the White House. Another chain e-mail, another !""",1
"“The Gallery” is similar to more than 100 other lawful state-licensed marijuana retail shops and hundreds of medical dispensaries in Washington state, with one exception: It is operating in defiance of local law. Its opening on Sunday set up a potential showdown with authorities in Pierce County, about an hour outside Seattle, which has effectively banned recreational pot shops in unincorporated areas so long as the drug remains illegal under federal law, even as medical pot businesses flourish virtually unregulated. “We didn’t do this to pick a fight with the county,” said co-owner Tedd Wetherbee, 47, in between chatting up customers in his shop in Parkland, in unincorporated Pierce County. “But at the same time we are state-licensed legitimate businessmen that want to do what the county seems to let other people do without any license.”  Since Washington state legalized recreational marijuana in a landmark 2012 vote that ushered in licensed retail pot shops in July, scores of municipalities have passed laws curbing their operations, from constricted zoning to outright bans. That has frustrated would-be pot entrepreneurs, such as Wetherbee, who are keen to capitalize on what they call a glut of recreational-use marijuana products with few stores licensed to sell it. Fifty-four percent of Pierce County voters backed marijuana legalization. “This act of theater will either embolden a bunch of other people to do it, or it will create really great PR for him,” said Dominic Corva, executive director at the Center for the Study of Cannabis and Social Policy. Wetherbee has argued in lawsuits that local pot-business bans that scuttled his retail plans in two other towns violate state law, and says it makes little sense to ban tightly regulated retail establishments while allowing medicinal shops to operate unchecked. State lawmakers are weighing proposals to license medical-use stores to, among other things, ensure their products are safe, a move entrepreneurs say would help level the regulatory playing field. Amid that uncertain landscape, Pierce County authorities say they have visited The Gallery for several inspections and advised Wetherbee he lacked proper permitting. Pierce County, which had objected to Wetherbee’s application for a state retail pot license but failed to block it, could issue noncompliance and cease-and-desist orders as early as Thursday that could cost up to $1,000 in daily fines if ignored. Washington state’s top lawyer has said the recreational marijuana law does not prevent local governments from banning pot businesses. But state regulators who grant the licenses do not consider local laws in their review process. “We have issued other state licenses in places where there are bans and moratoriums, though he is the only retailer that I have heard of, but there may be others,” said Liquor Control Board spokesman Brian Smith. There was no sign of controversy on Tuesday in Wetherbee’s shop, where pot products are displayed beside sculptures and abstract art. Its nondescript entrance contrasts sharply with the bold signage of a gun shop next door. A cut-out of former President Bill Clinton invites shoppers to “please feel free to inhale.” A security guard checks that patrons are at least 21 years old. Sealed bags of cannabis strains sell for about $14 to $24 per gram. Among the patrons was a construction worker who uses marijuana to “kick back” and a 29-year-old former U.S. Army medic battling insomnia and anxiety since returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. “I was going to a store down in the city (Tacoma), but this is a lot closer to my house,” said the former soldier, who gave his name only as Josh. “I like the environment a lot better too, the gallery feel.”",0
"In March 2019, our inbox started to fill with queries from readers who had heard that U. S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was an “actress” who was playing the role of congresswoman in order to further the agenda of a political group. These questions were based on a popular video entitled “The Brains Behind AOC Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” by YouTube user “Mr. Reagan.” The video, which can be viewed at the end of this article, hits on a number of issues in its 23 minutes, but the essential argument is that Ocasio-Cortez was “cast” by the group Justice Democrats into the “role” of congresswoman, and that she is merely a figurehead (or “puppet congresswoman”) pushing the group’s agenda. Here’s the opening statement from Mr. Reagan: Mr. Reagan: Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is not really the congresswoman of new york’s 14th congressional district. She is essentially an actress. She’s merely playing the part of a New York Congresswoman. I know this sounds crazy. But bare with me. In 2017, a group called the Justice Democrats held auditions for potential congressional candidates that would run on their platform for various congressional seats throughout the country. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ brother Gabriel submitted her for the role. Now I’ve auditioned for many acting roles in my day. I’ve also cast many of my own projects. I know how this works. If you find somebody with star power, even if they don’t 100% fit the part, you go with it. Obviously AOC has star power. Just look at her. She’s a superstar. The most famous person in congress, maybe ever. Their casting was perfect. Now I didn’t have to go digging for evidence for this, because they freely admit it. They brag about it. Cut to Alexandra Rojas. Executive Director Justice Democrats, saying: Back in 2016, we put out a call for nominations. We got over 10,000 nominations, out of those 10,000 nominations we found Alexandria. Cut to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, saying: My brother told me that he had sent my nominations in the summer but I was like literally working out of a restaurant and I was like there’s no way. Back to Mr. Reagan: A casting call. They had a casting call. They cast Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in the role of congresswoman. And they did this so they could promote their own agenda. Mr. Reagan repeatedly used words such as “role,” “audition,” “casting call” and labeled Ocasio-Cortez “essentially an actress” in this video in an apparent attempt to paint the congresswoman with the same conspiratorial brush used to promote “crisis actor” and “paid protester” conspiracy theories. Ironically, the only actor in this scenario is Chris Kohls, who plays the character of Mr. Reagan. Kohls told us in an email that “the use of the word ‘actress’ was illustrative.” He continued: “I did not mean to suggest that this was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s actual profession or an official role. I thought this was clear.” While Kohls admits that the congresswoman was not an actress in the literal sense, he said that he still believes she “audition(ed) for the role of congress woman as a response to an open casting call by Justice Democrats.” Kohls elaborated on this point via email:  AOC did, however, audition for the role of congress woman as a response to an open casting call by Justice Democrats. I have never heard of an organization holding auditions, open to the public, for congressional seats. Perhaps I am naive about that. I have never heard of this, and the response to my video suggests that most Americans find it inappropriate as well. The “Brains Behind AOC” video correctly states that Ocasio-Cortez was recruited by the Justice Democrats to run for office. However, this fact is presented in the video as if it were an unprecedented act of political malfeasance. In reality, it is quite common for Political Action Committees (PACs) to recruit candidates for office. The Justice Democrats made no attempt to hide this effort and openly discuss their recruitment process on their website and in videos published to their public YouTube page: PACs, which have been around since the 1940s, are organizations that raise money to help run campaigns for or against political candidates. While these groups may throw their support behind existing candidates who they believe will further their cause, they also recruit like-minded candidates and help them get elected to office. We conducted a brief search for other PACs that publish recruitment material and found numerous of organizations that actively seek candidates for political positions, such as  Brand New Congress, Run for Something, Emily’s List, BRAT-PAC, The National Federation for Republican Women, Winning for Women, American Possibilities, Elevate-Pac, The Collective Pac, and Principled Pac. In the case of the Justice Democrats, their main platform ideas are Medicare for All, protecting the environment, and racial justice. Mr. Reagan would have viewers believe that Ocasio-Cortez had no interest in politics before she was “cast” by the Justice Democrats, and that she was only taking up these causes because she was a “puppet congresswoman.” But that isn’t the case. Before Ocasio-Cortez ran for office, she volunteered for Bernie Sanders‘ 2016 campaign (a candidate who supports the same issues as the Justice Democrats). She was also involved in the Standing Rock protests and talked about issues such as civil rights, social change, and income equality before receiving support from the Justice Democrats. The fact that she shares these beliefs is not proof that Justice Democrats are “controlling” her. It’s merely evidence that AOC and the Justice Democrats were a good fit. While Mr. Reagan argues in “The Brains Behind AOC” that Ocasio-Cortez is a “puppet congresswoman” controlled by the Justice Democrats, Kohls told us, again, that this was pure speculation: My assertion is that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is presenting ideas to congress and to the public as of they are her own, but that they are not her own. They are the idea of the Justice Democrats and that this group, in particular Saikat Chakrabarti, are drafting everything for her. When I say “everything” I mean her official proposals to congress, her answers to questions by the media, her tweets and her unofficial propositions to the public. I also believe that she is directed on how to vote, but this is pure speculation. Mr. Reagan argues in “Brains Behind AOC” that Ocasio-Cortez “does not make her own policy decisions… decides which way she votes on legislation” but that “she defers completely to her team.” In addition to admitting in his email that these claims are based purely on speculation, this argument also appears to be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how politicians operate. While the public may be more familiar with the names and faces of senators and representatives, lawmakers have teams of people behind them that help guide them through interviews, debates, public messaging, and other political responsibilities. In short, it is not uncommon for a lawmaker to prepare for an interview or speech with the help of her staff. Saikat Chakrabarti, the congresswoman’s chief of staff, pushed back on the “Brains Behind AOC” video and said that Ocasio-Cortez does more than most lawmakers when it comes to her own messaging: The right-wing actually cannot believe that a working class latina like @AOC is smart, talented, and capable. They are creating entire conspiracy theories to try to disprove her intelligence. So here’s some @AOC facts to show y’all just how good she is. 1) @AOC runs her own Twitter/IG. This is VERY rare in Congress. Most politicians have staff come up with what to say/figure out how to frame things. But @AOC’s knowledge of issues is so deep that she does the communicating/framing herself. 2) @AOC writes all her own speeches. Though, TBH, most of her 🔥 speeches are off the dome. Just watch Coates interview her. She can talk in depth on policy issues for hours (unlike most politicians) because she REALLY knows what she’s talking about. 3) Unlike most MoCs [members of Congress], @AOC sits through full committee hearings and will often improvise on questions based on what she’s observing. Nobody prepped her to “play a game” in the HR1 hearing, and her entire staff watched it live with jaws dropped. 4) @AOC is one of the smartest & hardest working people I’ve ever known. Right wingers not comprehending this is peak racism/sexism — and also fear. If @AOC can do this, what’s to stop other talented working-class women of color from vying for power? Must keep ’em up at night. For those unfamiliar with political action committees or political advisers, “The Brains Behind AOC” may appear to be a well-produced video featuring a convincing narrative of how a political group “cast” a “star” into the role of congresswoman in order to further their agenda. However, the arguments made in this video are pure speculation and seem to largely be based on a misunderstanding of how PACs operate. It’s actually rather common for PACs, such as Justice Democrats, to seek out candidates, such as Ocasio-Cortez, who share their core beliefs, and even more commonplace for politicians to seek out the advice of their staff.

"""Recent radio and TV ads claim California’s K-12 public schools face dire cuts if voters fail to approve Proposition 55, a measure on November’s ballot that would extend an income tax hike on wealthy residents. The ads by the Yes on 55 campaign paint a dark picture. They cite past spending cuts that led to thousands of teacher layoffs, eliminated art and music programs and increased class sizes a few years ago. California, the ads claim, doesn’t have to repeat history. """"Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools simply by maintaining the current tax rates on the wealthiest Californians,"""" says the Yes campaign’s """"Can’t Go Back"""" TV ad. The claim about """"$4 billion in new cuts to our schools"""" is made at the 0:17 minute mark in this video. We wondered whether the choice is that stark: Does California really face $4 billion in new school cuts if Prop 55 fails? Our research Before diving in, here’s some background on the temporary tax increase Prop 55 asks voters to extend. In 2012, California voters approved Prop 30, which was promoted as a temporary solution. That measure raised income tax rates on high-income residents and sales tax rates through 2018 to pay for schools. Supporters at the time described it as a way to stave off additional deep education cuts from the state’s financial crisis and Great Recession. Prop 55 asks voters to continue that higher income tax rate for 12 additional years, through 2030, but not the sales tax increase. It would apply to earnings more than $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for couples. If the measure fails, the higher income tax rate would phase out in 2018. Less money for schools? There’s no doubt the failure of Prop 55 would result in less money for public schools. The California Legislative Analyst’s Office projects Prop 55 would raise between $2 billion and $4.5 billion annually for K-12 schools and community colleges, depending on the economy. But even if Prop 55 fails, school funding would continue to increase through 2019-2020, according to Department of Finance figures. That’s in part because revenue from Prop 30 continues through the 2018-2019 fiscal year. It doesn’t run out right away. By 2019-2020, however, school costs would outpace total revenue by $4 billion, based on the end of Prop 30 and expected inflation, according to the state Department of Finance and an interview with Ana Matosantos, the department’s former director. Matosantos supports Prop 55 and spoke in favor of it at a recent public forum. """"Costs will rise faster than funding,"""" Matosantos said in the interview. """"The big issue is inflation."""" Competing outlooks There could be even greater pressure on school funding under one financial outlook, Matosantos said. That's because the state projects a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for the 2019-2020 fiscal year. That deficit is cited in the state Department of Finance’s multi-year budget outlook, and would account for the rising costs of everything from prisons to debt payments to health care, she said. Source: California Department of Finance, General Fund Multi-Year Forecast, June 2016 There’s no specific law that would require the state to cut school spending to close these shortfalls. It could take money from other services. But more than likely, Matosantos said, schools would experience cuts. Not everyone sees a bleak financial forecast. The Legislative Analyst’s Office expects California will have a nearly $2 billion operating surplus in 2019-2020, the same year the state Department of Finance forecasts a $4 billion operating shortfall. Source: Legislative Analyst’s Office, Multiyear State Budget Outlook, May 2016 The Yes on 55 campaign """"is using the figures that are convenient to them,"""" said David Wolfe, legislative director for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. Wolfe spoke against Prop 55 at a recent forum. Steve Boilard, a Sacramento State University political analyst, expressed skepticism earlier this year over some Yes on 55 statements, including the campaign’s earlier claim in May that the measure’s failure could lead to $5 billion in cuts to schools. """"Looking at the numbers, I can see how they come up with dollar amounts that they do,"""" Boilard, who spent years crunching budget numbers for the state’s non-partisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, said in a Capital Public Radio article, at the time. """"But I think it’s framed in a way that seems much more dire than it should otherwise be interpreted."""" A Sacramento Bee fact check recently rated the Yes on 55 claim as """"iffy."""" It found """"the ad’s warning of $4 billion in cuts if the measure does not pass relies on an optimistic assumption of how much money the tax will raise, as well as an overly simplistic characterization of school funding estimates. Our ruling The Yes on 55 campaign claimed in recent ads that """"Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools."""" There would certainly be less money for schools if the tax extension fails. But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55’s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate. But they leave the impression that the measure’s failure will lead to deep school cuts much sooner. And that’s not the case. We rate the Yes on 55 claim . – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",1
"The claim that Donald Trump was never accused of being a racist before running for president is false. That rumor surfaced in the form of a meme on social media in mid-May, shortly after Donald Trump had all but clinched the Republican presidential nomination. The meme got traction after former MLB pitcher Kurt Schilling re-tweeted it on May 16th:  But Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, were accused engaging in racially biased housing policies in 1973. The Department of Justice sued the Trump Management Corporation (Donald was its president at the time) for an “antiblack bias” in its housing policies that allegedly violated the Fair Housing Act, the New York Times reported in 1973:  Donald Trump also faced accusations of racism after he took out a full-page ad in the New York Daily News that called for the death penalty for the “Central Park 5,” a group of black teenagers accused of raping and beating a jogger, in 1989, the New Yorker reports: And, in early May, 1989, Donald Trump took out a full-page ad in the Daily News to say what he thought he knew about the case. Trump was on the front page of the papers often enough that season; the Post’s “SPLIT!” headline marking the end of his marriage would help fill the tabloid space between the teen-agers’ arrest and their conviction, as did “MARLA BOASTS TO HER PALS ABOUT DONALD: ‘BEST SEX I’VE EVER HAD,’ ” which quoted his then-mistress and second wife; soon, there was also coverage of his baroque business failures. Perhaps he thought it gave him gravitas, that spring, to weigh in on the character of the teen-agers in the park: “How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!” And his headline suggested what ought to be done with them: BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE! The Central Park 5 were falsely convicted and served time in prison before the jogger’s real attacker came forward and the teens were cleared of the charges and released in 2002. Trump was also accused of “making racial slurs against black people” in the 1991 book “Trumped!” that was written by a former Trump casino executive named John O’Donnell, the Inquisitor reports: The book’s description of remarks by Trump about black people could be significant if proven accurate because Steven P. Perskie, the casino commission chairman, has ordered proceedings to ban a high-roller from the gambling halls for making similar remarks. O’Donnell described a dinner conversation with Trump in which, he writes, they discussed Trump Plaza’s financial executive, who was black. He quoted Trump as saying he never liked the man and believed he was not doing a good job. Trump’s conversation is recounted: “And isn’t it funny. I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. . . . I think the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” O’Donnell writes that he advised Trump against publicly espousing such views. Allegations that Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had removed black dealers from tables at the request of gamblers later landed Trump;s business in court, UPI reports: TRENTON, N.J. — The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino has lost a bid to overturn a $200,000 penalty imposed because managers catered to the presumed prejudices of a high roller by removing a black dealer from his table. A New Jersey appeals court upheld a ruling by the Casino Control Commission. The court also ruled that the penalty, one of the highest ever from the Division of Gaming Enforcement, was not disproprotionate to the offense. So, claims that Donald Trump was never accused of racism before running for president are false. Comments",1
"The seventh “WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic” said blocking the industry’s interference was critical to cutting the harm from tobacco use. “The tobacco industry has a long history of systemic, aggressive, sustained and well-resourced opposition to tobacco control measures,” the report said. “While some strategies are public and others more covert... all have the goal of weakening tobacco control.”  The report said tobacco giant Philip Morris International was trying to position itself as a responsible public health partner via its “Unsmoke” campaign, which encourages people to “change to a better alternative”. The WHO said the campaign aimed to ensure tobacco remained socially acceptable, while confusing consumers with terms such as “smoke-free products”, which may refer to products with toxic emissions and unknown short-term and long-term health effects. Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow said the WHO’s message made it harder to provide safer options for people who cannot quit smoking. “There is no question that the best choice for smokers is to quit cigarettes and nicotine altogether. The reality is many people do not. We cannot turn our backs on them,” he said. “Organisations like the World Health Organization need to stop talking at smokers and start listening.”  The WHO report said the industry hoped to win respectability through manipulative messages such as claiming their products were part of a “harm reduction” strategy, even though cigarettes still account for 97% of the global tobacco market. Vinayak Prasad, programme manager of WHO’s tobacco control unit, said development of new products was solely intended to expand the markets of tobacco firms. “There is no difference between cigarettes and heated tobacco products except that in terms of exposure: the exposure is less and the smoke is not visible,” he said. Electronic cigarettes, containing nicotine but not tobacco, were promoted as a way to quit smoking. But there was no evidence to justify the claim, and evidence from the United States showed they had increased the prevalence of young people smoking, he said. “So it’s also a gateway for young people,” Prasad said. “The answer is it needs to be regulated. WHO has clear guidelines – to get electronic cigarettes regulated. And if you are banning it, fine, but if you aren’t banning it don’t let it (go) free in the market, because the young people are taking it up.”",0
"Three days before Christmas of 2004, Marine Sgt. Ty Ziegel was on a routine patrol during his second tour of duty in Iraq when a suicide bomber blew up near his truck. The blast took off a portion of his left arm and three fingers from his other hand, fractured his jaw, left him blind in one eye, shattered his skull, and melted most of the skin off his head. Sgt. Ziegel was in a coma for months afterwards and spent nearly two years recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas, where he underwent more than 50 operations including the fitting of a plastic cap for his skull and the surgical reconstruction of his face with holes for his missing ears and nose. The London Times described the transformation of Sgt. Ziegel’s experience into what seemed to be a modern day fairy tale:  The fairy tale goes like this: they are high-school sweethearts from a small town, Metamora, Illinois, in the American Midwest. He graduates from high school, becomes a US marine and is sent to Iraq. When he returns, they get engaged. He proposes before he leaves for his second tour. She is 18; he is 21. She can’t wait for him to come home. The tour is cut short. A suicide bomber blows up near his truck and he suffers horrific, life-changing injuries. A day later he is in San Antonio, Texas, at the Brooke Army Medical Center. She leaves her home town for the first time to fly there with his mother so they can be by his side. She is there for him. His injuries are severe. He will have numerous operations and she will stand by him throughout. It will be a year and a half before they all go home. In the meantime, she will move in with his mother. The homecoming is a triumph. He is a hero and she is his heroine. Their commitment to each other is inspiring and rock-solid. They get married. She is now 21 and he is 24. The wedding takes place on October 7, 2006, and that date is declared a state holiday. Renee and Tyler Ziegel Day. Their romance is covered by The Sunday Times Magazine. They plan to have a family. Love conquers all. During the period between Ty’s convalescence and his marriage to Renée Kline, photographer Nina Berman, on assignment for People magazine, visited him three separate times and recorded a series of photographs chronicling his recovery, homecoming and wedding day. One of those photographs was an iconic image shown which in 2006 won in the portraiture category of the World Press Photo contest, the most prestigious international award for photojournalism — yet it was questioned by some social media users when they encountered it with no explanatory context:  I wanted to know if there’s any way to tell if this photo is accurate? It’s circulating Facebook right now with a caption of “This man served our country. Like for respect”. But, the girl in the photo, why does she look so unamused? Shouldn’t she be smiling? And her face looks very pixelated. I would love to know more on the backstory if possible. The photograph was described as follows by Lindsay Beyerstein for a 2007 Salon article:  A young couple stands side by side facing the camera. There are all the usual accouterments: the frosted, school-photo backdrop, the red bouquet precisely matched to the red trim on the bride’s white gown. The groom wears a decorated dress uniform. It could be any couple in any town — except that the groom’s features have literally been melted off. He has no nose, no chin, no ears and no hair. His head appears to attach directly to his shoulders, and his face is so badly burned that it’s a struggle to decipher his expression. The bride’s expression is equally opaque. Some people think she looks stunned. Others describe her expression as anxious, or even fearful. Her mouth turns down slightly at the edges, but her wide brown eyes gaze straight ahead and something about the set of her jaw suggests resolve. Some viewers strenuously deny that there’s anything unusual about the young woman’s countenance at all. In that article, Nina Berman also described the circumstances under which the photograph was taken:  It was their wedding day. Before they went to the high school where they were married, they went to a commercial portrait studio. I normally don’t find those commercial studio pictures very interesting. They seem fake. People just put on a happy face. But then I thought, this is a different wedding picture, isn’t it? So I kind of stepped back. I thought, it’s the same as having someone with their body blasted off in a high school yearbook. Rituals like this, young people getting married, if this doesn’t say that this war is having an impact, I don’t know what does. It just cries out to people — hey, this war is real. There’s a very palpable reality to this war in certain communities. It’s right there, not in the cities or on the coasts. Most people in the media and the cultural elite don’t know anyone in the military. My whole goal is to say, hey, this war is not some kind of abstract thing. Unfortunately, difficulties in the marriage proved too much for the couple to overcome, and Ty and Renée were divorced in January 2008:  The fairy tale, as we know it, was not meant to be. They were too young to be married. Too young to process the possibility that what led them into a lifelong commitment was a desire for certainty in an uncertain world. There is no mystery, no implosion, no tragic conclusion. There were factors that added up. Factors that at the time they could not have foreseen. That a marriage would not offset the consequences of Ty’s injuries. That it would not compensate for the loss and the grief felt by a young woman losing her father. Everyone suspected it was too soon — that maybe it wasn’t right. But nobody spoke out. Others, strangers, projected onto them what they needed to believe. They were larger than life. When we heard their story, we put ourselves in their shoes, imagining what we would do in the same situation. Renee personified the courage and strength we hoped we would have. But she was 18 years old. And neither is prone to introspection. They weren’t people who asked why. Between the two of them, they had so much life experience, but the emotional narrative of their lives never caught up. What made us think it would? Why did we have such high hopes for them in the first place? Nobody really ever knew Ty and Renee. Not even Ty and Renee. But this is not the end. They emerged from the marriage with warmth and affection for each other — not anger and recrimination. She was there when he needed her most; she showed up and stood by him. That is more than many people will ever have in a marriage. It is something they will always share. Ty Ziegel passed away in December 2012:  A Metamora Iraq War veteran, who became a symbol of survival after a car bomb explosion, has died. Family members say 30-year-old Ty Ziegel died after falling on ice. Angela Cochran, Ziegel’s girlfriend, said he has been an inspiration in the three months since they began dating. “You can ask him anything about his scars, his time in Iraq, how everything happened; he’s like an open book,” said Cochran. “He was willing to share stories. That’s what makes him so inspiring. He’s not trying to hide.”",0
"The sale of anti-rabies treatment Rabipur and Encepur, used  for the prevention of tick-borne encephalitis, to the Denmark-based biotechnology firm includes an upfront payment of 301 million euros and milestone payments of up to 495 million euros. Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley has been pushing for a leaner structure since she took over in 2017 by spinning off or selling units to focus on reinvigorating GSK’s pharmaceuticals business. It staged a comeback into cancer treatments with a $5.1 billion buyout of U.S. drugmaker Tesaro in December last year. “This agreement with Bavarian Nordic will enable us to commit greater resources to our key growth assets and to our R&D pipeline,” Roger Connor, president of Global Vaccines at GSK said. GSK, which is preparing to separate its consumer-facing products and drugs businesses, acquired the vaccines from Novartis in 2015 as part of a broad asset-swap here in which GSK sold its oncology business to the Swiss drugmaker. The drugmaker reported revenue of 5.89 billion pounds ($7.61 billion) from its vaccines segment in 2018. London-listed GSK said that both vaccines will continue to be manufactured at its Marburg site in Germany until full production is transferred to Bavarian Nordic within five years.",0
"On 25 August 2016, multiple Fox News-linked accounts published tweets and articles about a school “training course” that led many social media users to believe was a class offered at the State University of New York at Binghamton (commonly known as Binghamton University) called “Stop White People.” Columnist Todd Starnes penned a column about the controversy, describing a “workshop” offered as “an official part of the residential assistant training program”: Nothing screams tolerance and diversity like a university workshop designed to target white people. The State University of New York in Binghamton has a bit of explaining to do after they held a workshop titled, “#StopWhitePeople2K16.” The workshop was an official part of the residential assistant training program at the taxpayer-funded university. The Binghamton Review, the university’s conservative newspaper, exposed this nonsense and they deserve a round of applause for their efforts. Starnes referenced a 24 August 2016 item published by student newspaper the Binghamton Review  that included additional detail about the teacup tempest, but the latter was far clearer about the minute scope and origin of the printed material (depicted above) that prompted the rumors: On Friday, August 12, an optional conference for Binghamton University Residential Assistants entitled “#StopWhitePeople2K16” was held in an effort to “take the next step in understanding diversity, privilege, and the society we function within.” Naturally, that title garnered a significant amount of attention in a very short period of time, and before long, the University delivered an official response to concerns from those who believed the title was racist. Brian Rose, Binghamton University’s Vice President of Student Affairs, wrote in his response to the controversy that the program was not “anti-white,” and instead was simply a “discussion” that “explored reverse racism, the relationship of communities of color with police, whiteness, crime and segregation in an open conversation format.” Rose also wrote that the titular hashtag “is commonly used ironically,” and “as the senior student affairs officer on campus,” he is “supportive of the students’ efforts to facilitate dialogue around a challenging set of topics.” Rose indeed issued an undated statement about an optional 12 August 2016 event for resident advisors (RAs) at Binghamton, during which three RAs hosted the presentation described in the printed material. Rose noted that the presentation in question centered on race relations and referenced a popular existing Twitter hashtag that was not created by Binghamton RAs: A program facilitated by three student resident advisors (RA’s) as part of an educational program for RA staff training has prompted public and internal comment and inquiry. The program title “#StopWhitePeople2K16” was drawn from a familiar hashtag in use on Twitter, and was not invented by the program facilitators. It is my understanding that the hashtag is commonly used ironically. The optional program was developed by the students themselves, supported by a young professional staff person. Its purpose, as conceived, was to facilitate a discussion among the RA’s that would improve their ability to handle conflicts among residents around issues of diversity. Upon learning of the concerns expressed over the session’s title by some off-campus groups and individuals, the university’s student-affairs office reviewed the session and the program content more closely to obtain an accurate understanding. We verified that the actual program content was not “anti-white”. The inclusion of the program in the educational session was not driven by any university administration initiative to advocate any specific viewpoint on diversity. About 40-50 RA’s chose to attend the session which ran concurrently with some other sessions. Topically the discussion in the program was far-ranging, student driven and explored reverse racism, the relationship of communities of color with police, whiteness, crime and segregation in an open conversation format. Post session feedback predominantly described the session as a respectful and productive conversation. Professional staff followed up directly with a few participants who had a mixed reaction to the program in support of those participants. What we strive to do from an administrative level is cultivate an environment where our students listen to one another, learn from one another and do so in a manner that doesn’t cause unnecessary harm. I have no indication that this particular program was inconsistent with the respectful environment we hope to support and sustain. Nevertheless, rumors quickly spread on social media indicating that Binghamton was offering a full course in their curriculum called “Stop White People,” and a number of web sites and online users reacted to that misinterpretation. We contacted the university’s media relations department and a representative with whom we spoke reiterated that the RA-only presentation was student-led and student-managed, adding that Binghamton at no time has offered a “Stop White People” class as part of any school curriculum.",1
"Rumors about canned food contaminated with HIV in Thailand were debunked years ago, but they went viral again on social media as 2016 came to a close. It’s not clear where, exactly, rumors about canned foods contaminated with HIV came from, but they spread quickly across social media. A post that was widely circulated on Twitter warned: Radio 1 FM announced that Thai govt confirmed: Emergency notification: Do NOT eat canned food especially those canned fruits manufactured in Thailand. There were 200 over HIV carriers instructed by their leader to contaminate the products of the canned food factory with their blood. The information was confirmed by the government this morning. In order not to let the people get infected after eating, many types of canned food such as loggan, lychee, rambutan and mango putting had been removed from the shelves of supermarkets. Please send GC to people you care. Prevention is better than cure! Please don’t take canned food from Thailand. We couldn’t find any credible reports of canned food contaminated with HIV. In fact, we found a press release issued by the Royal Thai Embassy in October 2014 that specifically debunked the warning: Related to the recent spread of rumours circulated via text messages alerting recipients that canned food, particularly canned fruits, manufactured in Thailand were contaminated with HIV virus. The Embassy wishes to inform that the circulated message is a hoax with no credible evidences to support such accusation. Related Thai agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, and Food and Drug Administration of Thailand, had announced that Thai canned products have been thoroughly inspected and are certified according to international standards (GMP and HACCP) before the products could be shipped out. In fact, the heat treatment during the processing method will eliminate all harmful microbes and other viruses that may existed. Moreover, HIV virus needs a human host cell to live and it does not live long outside the human body. Therefore, it is not possible that canned products are contaminated with HIV as claimed. In a separate statement, Mr. Roy Sparringa, head of Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) also said that ‘the message is not true, have long been circulated, and misleading’ and confirmed that BPOM has never found the said contamination. The message may aims to discredit the Thai food exporter and Thai canned fruits industry. Similar messages were also circulated in Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia in 2013. Warnings about food contaminated with HIV aren’t necessarily new, either. We previously investigated false reports that blood oranges from Libya had been injected with HIV infected blood and that bananas purchased at Walmart stores had been tainted with HIV infected blood. These warnings appear to prey on people’s fear of contracting HIV. However, it would be nearly impossible to contract HIV from blood injected into a fruit because the virus depends on a human host for survival, the non-profit group Aid for AIDs reports: “HIV is a very fragile virus outside of the body. The HIV virus needs the human body as its host. The life span of HIV outside of the body has not been determined. However, we know that HIV needs its host cell (a human), the body temperature, and the chemistry of the blood to survive. Out of the body, HIV is out of its environment. As the blood dries, the HIV will die. In areas like a syringe or on a razor in a medicine cabinet, HIV would probably live longer because of less airflow and it’s a more moist temperature controlled area. “Just remember, outside of the body HIV can’t survive. In minutes it will die and be harmless, but Universal Precautions should always be used.” All of these warnings about HIV-infected blood in foods are baseless and should be ignored. Comments",1
"""Think twice about buying Girl Scout cookies, a national group urges, because participating girls are taught to admire """"pro-abortion women."""" A reader told us she fielded a Feb. 4, 2014, email blast with that message signed by Judie Brown, president of the Virginia-based American Life League. One of the blast’s claims: The Girl Scouts of the USA """"curriculum now promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate."""" According to a biographical sketch posted online by Harvard University, Sanger was a nurse and lecturer who opened the country’s first birth-control clinic and later founded the American Birth Control League (which was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942). Friedan, according to another Harvard web page, famously authored """"The Feminine Mystique,"""" published in 1963, which """"fueled the controversy over women's proper place in society and had a dramatic impact on women in the United States and abroad. Friedan quickly became the leading advocate for change in the status of women."""" In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women (NOW), a civil rights organization for women, serving as its first president, according to the web page, and later was vice president of the National Association to Repeal Abortion Laws and also on a Girl Scouts USA board. By telephone and email, Paul Rondeau, the league’s executive director, credited a former Girl Scouts troop leader, Christy Volanski, with the research behind the claim. The league calls itself the largest grass-roots Catholic pro-life organization in the nation. Let’s take the Girl Scouts’ """"promotion"""" of Sanger and Friedan one by one. Margaret Sanger Rondeau told us that after the group sent its email blast, Volanski made it clear that the Girl Scouts’ """"promotion"""" of Sanger was not directly in the scouts’ curriculum; instead, that occurred via social media. Volanski, of Spring, Texas, guided us to the Pinterest page for Girl Scout Cadettes, meaning scouts in grades six through eight, includes a link to a May 17, 2013, entry on""""The Eloquent Woman"""" blog created by Denise Graveline, a public speaking coach and communications consultant based in Washington, D.C. The blog entry lists 13 speeches on human rights by women including Sojourner Truth, Clara Barton, Margaret Chase Smith, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lady Gaga, Betty Friedan and Sally Field. The Sanger entry says: """"Women's rights to birth control were Margaret Sanger's campaign in the 1920s, and for her efforts to speak out on this issue, she was arrested and ignored and fought. Her focus was the children born ‘unwelcome, unwanted, unprepared for, unknown,’ a stirring bit of alliteration."""" That entry links to another web page describing and excerpting a speech by Sanger in 1925 on the results of overpopulation and a lack of birth-control options. A web link leads to the full March 30, 1925, speech, posted on an Iowa State University website, in which Sanger argued for women to be free from """"enforced, enslaved maternity. There can be no hope for the future of civilization, no certainty of racial salvation,"""" she said, """"until every woman can decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother, and when and how many children she cares to bring into the world."""" We saw no mention of abortion on the Sanger web pages. Betty Friedan Friedan appears in the Girl Scouts’ curriculum, Volanski told us, as one of the exemplary women described in bottom-of-the-page blurbs in """"Your Voice, Your World, The Power of Advocacy,"""" a 2008 guide for older scouts interested in learning about how to make a case for change. The guide, which we obtained from Austin-based Girl Scouts of Central Texas, has more than 50 of the """"Voices for Good"""" blurbs, each one about specific women and their actions/achievements in the years from 1792 through 2007. Two blurbs mention Friedan, neither one touching on abortion or her involvement in starting the abortion rights action league. In 1963, the guide says, Friedan published """"The Feminine Mystique,"""" """"attacking the belief that homemaking and childbearing are the only ways for women to find satisfaction in their lives. She postulates that a system requiring women to find their identity solely as wives and mothers stunts them. The book galvanizes the women’s movement."""" In 1966, the guide says, Friedan and Pauli Murray, the first black woman Episcopal priest, wrote the mission statement for the National Organization for Women, with a declared purpose of women gaining full participation in American society in """"true equal partnership with men."""" Today, the guide says, the group’s priorities include an end to violence against women. Other women described in the blurbs include prominent figures in the Democratic Party, which has championed abortion rights. The women include Texan Barbara Jordan, the first woman to keynote the Democrats’ national convention; Geraldine Ferrraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee; Hillary Clinton, singled out for seeking health care reform in 1993; and Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress. Other women blurbed in the guide include Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court; Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979; civil rights icon Rosa Parks; Eleanor Roosevelt; Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a union organizer who helped launch the American Civil Liberties Union in 1920; and Dolores Huerta, co-founder in 1962 of what became the United Farm Workers and an organizer for women’s equality and other causes. We spotted no mentions of abortion or birth control in the 103-page guide. By phone, we asked Volanski if the women touted in the guide represent a mix of Americans. """"They do have a couple of conservative ladies in there,"""" Volanski said, mentioning Mother Teresa. """"I’d say it’s wide-ranging,"""" she said, yet more of the chosen women are """"left-leaning,"""" making the mix unbalanced, she said. Girls Scouts respond On a """"What We Stand For"""" web page, the Girl Scouts of the USA says: """"The Girl Scout organization does not take a position on abortion or birth control. We believe this is a private matter for girls and their families."""" By phone, Kelly Parisi, spokeswoman for the New York-based Girl Scouts, said the scouts’ curriculum does not depict Sanger, Friedan and other women as pro-abortion icons. Parisi noted that the entry on the Pinterest page created for scout Cadettes points to a web page listing speeches by 13 women; that is, it doesn’t promote Sanger alone. Also, Parisi said, the Friedan blurbs in the scouts’ guide state only that she wrote her book and helped found NOW, Parisi said, not delving into her position on abortion access. """"You cannot talk about women’s history in this country without mentioning Betty Friedan,"""" Parisi said. Asked about Volanski’s suggestion that the mix of listed advocates is unbalanced, Parisi replied: """"We’re not trying to be balanced because we’re not trying to promote a political agenda. We don’t vet these women based on their political beliefs."""" """"We are a nonpartisan, nonpolitical organization,"""" Parisi said. Rondeau, by email, said our sampling of the blurbs in the guide (which we’d shared with him) demonstrates its pro-abortion slant in that all but two of the women whose blurbs we noted had shown such a lean, while only Mother Teresa clearly believed otherwise. """"The pattern seems quite clear,"""" Rondeau wrote. Our ruling The league said Girl Scouts USA’s curriculum """"promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate."""" A Girl Scouts’ Pinterest page--not the scouts’ curriculum--leads to a blog post highlighting speeches by 13 women, including one by Sanger. The scouts' advocacy guide, part of the organization’s curriculum, features two blurbs on Friedan and also thumbnails other women who have advocated abortion rights. However, none of the guide's 50-some biographical blurbs mentions any woman's activism per abortion as a reason for singling her out. Abortion is not mentioned elsewhere in the guide, either. We find no factual reason to conclude that the scouts are teaching girls in this vein. We rate this claim as .""",1
"Between March 2013 and March 2014, more than 50 complaints about e-cigarettes were filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to data obtained through a public records request. That is on par with the combined number reported over the previous five years. The health problems were not necessarily caused by e-cigarettes. And it is not clear that the rate of adverse events has increased. In 2011, about 21 percent of adult smokers had used e-cigarettes, according to federal data, more than double the rate in 2010. Still, David Ashley, director of the office of science at the FDA’s tobacco division, said the uptick is significant, especially in light of a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing an increase in the number of e-cigarette-related calls to poison control centers. “Both together does suggest there are more instances going on,” he said. The FDA is poised to regulate e-cigarettes and other “vaping” devices for the first time, potentially reshaping an industry that generates roughly $2 billion a year in the United States. Some industry analysts see e-vapor consumption outpacing that of traditional cigarettes, now an $85 billion industry, within a decade. E-cigarettes are battery-powered cartridges filled with a nicotine liquid that, when heated, creates an inhalable mist. Little is known about the long-term health effects of the products, which were developed in China and moved into the U.S. market in 2007. “Some evidence suggests that e-cigarette use may facilitate smoking cessation, but definitive data are lacking,” Dr. Priscilla Callahan-Lyon of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products wrote in a recent medical journal article. Contradictory findings from preliminary studies have become ammunition in the lobbying campaign around the devices, which allow users to inhale nicotine without the damaging tar produced by conventional cigarettes. Public health officials have said the devices may encourage  nonsmokers, particularly young people, to try conventional cigarettes. E-cigarette advocates have argued that they provide a safer alternative for smokers. The FDA has sponsored research to try to answer safety questions, and it is examining its database of adverse events for any trends that might raise concerns. The complaints from the public filed with the FDA cited trouble breathing, headache, cough, dizziness, sore throat, nose bleeds, chest pain or other cardiovascular problems, and allergic reactions such as itchiness and swelling of the lips. One person told the FDA that while eating dinner at a restaurant a customer at the next table was smoking an e-cigarette. “The vapor cloud was big enough to come over my table and the e-cig smoker was ‘huffing’ it voraciously,” the person, whose name was redacted, wrote. “I got dizzy, my eyes began to water and I ended up taking my food to go because of the intense heartbeat I began to develop.”  One woman wrote that her husband began smoking e-cigarettes liberally in his car and home after being told they were safe and that the vapor was “just like water.”  “My 4-year-old has had a raspy voice since he started but I really didn’t think anything of it till last night my husband was just puffing away on that thing for hours and I woke up wheezing and unable to breathe.”  Miguel Martin, president of Logic Technology, one of the biggest U.S. e-cigarette makers along with Lorillard Inc and privately held NJOY, said the spike in adverse event reports reinforces the importance of regulation, especially in areas governing manufacturing practices and labeling, where standards can vary dramatically. “Clearly, because of the business opportunities, you have companies in an unregulated environment that are importing without checks and balances,” he said, adding that while Logic pays attention to quality control, “some other companies just are not having the same diligence or focus.”  Most e-cigarettes are made in China and sold under more than 300 brands in the United States, some through retail stores, others online. The quality of the products is inconsistent, however, making it difficult to tease out the cause of any health problems. One smoker began using e-cigarettes following dental surgery after the dentist said quitting smoking would speed the healing process, according to a report filed last October with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission that was forwarded to the  “It blew up in my mouth while inhaling, burning my stitches and gum, lip and fingers,” the report said. Others complained of over-heating devices. “The electric cigarette gets hot when you use it and alters the taste buds,” wrote one consumer. “I just recently realized what was turning my taste buds black.”  It is not possible to draw general conclusions from individual case reports, but there is a growing recognition that the inconsistent quality of the devices, aside from any risk inherent in the inhalation of nicotine vapor, poses potential safety risks. In a bid to address quality concerns, some e-cigarette makers are beginning to make them, either partially or wholly, in the United States. Reynolds American Inc, which began selling its Vuse e-cigarettes in Colorado last July and expects to expand nationwide this summer, makes its products in Kansas and North Carolina, though it still imports its batteries from China. The reason, Richard Smith, a Reynolds spokesman said, is that inconsistent quality is turning off potential customers. “There has been a high level of trial among adult consumers but a low level of adoption,” he said. While the cost may be higher than sourcing ready-made products from China, the pay-off, Reynolds is betting, will be customer loyalty. If a quality problem arises during the manufacturing process, Smith said, “we can identify and fix it.”",0
"Memes peddling false political claims often work best when they sprinkle a pinch of fact into their misinformation stew. That appears to be the strategy employed in memes making use of U.S. congressman Matt Gaetz’s mug shot from a 2008 DUI arrest:  The fact blended into these memes’ fictions is that a mug shot stemming from Gaetz’s arrest for driving under the influence is real, as has been acknowledged by the congressman himself and was reported by the Tampa Bay Times in 2014: It was the night before Halloween in 2008 when Gaetz, then 26, drove back from the Swamp, a nightclub on Okaloosa Island. He drove a 2001 BMW SUV registered to his state senator dad. Near midnight, Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz going 48 in a 35 mph zone. Anglin later reported that Gaetz fumbled for his license and registration, his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car. Smelling alcohol, Anglin asked Gaetz if he had been drinking. Gaetz replied no. Minutes later, he admitted he had consumed two beers. Twice, Anglin conducted an eye test. Twice, Gaetz’s eyes didn’t follow the prompt. Gaetz, who had recently begun practicing law, declined any field sobriety tests. He was arrested and refused the breath test. A controversy ensued when charges against Gaetz, whose father was a member of the Florida State Senate at the time, were dropped and his license was reinstated. This occurred despite a Florida law requiring a year-long suspension for refusing to take a breathalyzer test. According to the Tampa Bay Times, “A field officer for the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breath test. Yet the refusal was clearly documented in [the arresting officer’s] affidavit and arrest report.” The arresting officer, Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin, resigned a month after the Gaetz arrest under pressure from his superiors, who cited disciplinary issues. The question of whether Gaetz’s father’s political connections played an improper role in these outcomes has dogged Gaetz for years. Gaetz, for his part, has dismissed such allegations as “tabloid journalism.” In terms of what is accessible via public records, the 2008 arrest is Gaetz’s only recorded DUI. Despite that, several memes and articles make the claim that Gaetz has had at least seven DUI arrests. The earliest iteration of this claim appears to stem from an August 29, 2016, post written by conspiracy theorist Wayne Madsen, who stated: “Matt Gaetz, currently a member of the Florida House of Representatives, portrays himself to the Bible-thumping voters of the Panhandle as a God-fearing conservative. However, even a partial glance at Gaetz’s record reveals at least seven arrests for drunk driving and a reputed alternate gay life style. Gaetz’s politically powerful father Don ensured that none of the arrests led to prosecutions.” Madsen provided no hint as to the location or nature of these purported records. We reached out to Madsen via his website to ask if he could provide any documentary evidence for these claims but did not receive a response. A criminal record produced by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, whom we queried on July 3, 2019, showed only one DUI arrest, but such a report would not include offenses from other states:  Public records searches performed by Snopes in other jurisdictions did not turn up any additional DUI arrests. Another bit of a fact sprinkled into this claim is that Gaetz does have a prolific record of traffic violations. A 2014 investigation conducted by northern Florida newspaper TCPalm tracked the driving records of hundreds of Florida state politicians. Matt Gaetz, with 16 speeding tickets between 1999 and 2014, was among the most frequently cited lawmakers. Mentions of a “suspicious” death of Gaetz’s roommate during his four years at Florida State University between 1999 and 2003, like the claims of seven DUIs, did not exist online prior to Madsen’s August 2016 piece, in which he stated: What would be Panhandle politics without a dead body? Gaetz’s roommate at Florida State University was reportedly found dead under suspicious circumstances while they were undergraduate students. … Sources close to the investigation of the death, however, told [Wayne Madsen Reports] that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated the death as a possible homicide but the agency was later politically-pressured to rule it a suicide. Madsen being the only source for this claim merits suspicion on its own: He has a history of making wholly baseless claims without evidence. A prominent proponent of the claim that former President Obama is not a U.S. citizen, he has, for example, falsely claimed that Barack Obama had “homosexual trysts” with Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Senate majority leader Bill Frist (among others), and Madsen is the author of a self-published book asserting that Obama’s rise to the White House was engineered by the CIA. Not only is the suspicious “roommate death” claim flawed, but further doubt is cast on its veracity by the fact that we have been unable to identify any contemporaneous press accounts of suspicious deaths of a Florida State University student who could possibly have been a Gaetz roommate between 1999 and 2003. Though an administrator at Florida State University confirmed to us that roughly 30 students with expected graduations between 1999 and 2003 passed away during that time period, we found nothing publicly suggesting a Gaetz link to any case that received press coverage. As such, we consider the claim without merit. While the mug shot and 2008 DUI arrest are true, additional elements of this brand of Matt Gaetz meme appears to be sourced solely from the imagination of a conspiracy theorist.",1
"An Associated Press analysis published in late September 2018 warned that prescription drug prices in the United States were still rising precipitously despite President Trump’s vow to reduce them. During the first seven months of the year, the report said, prescription drug prices saw 96 increases for every cut. The human cost of runaway prescription drugs prices was dramatically illustrated in a meme shared on the Occupy Democrats Facebook page on 18 September:  This is Alex Smith. He died this year at age 26 because he couldn’t afford insulin in America. He made $35,000 a year as a restaurant manager, and couldn’t afford his $450 a month health insurance with a $7,600 out-of-pocket deductible. The insulin he needed for diabetes was $1,300 a month. When he turned 26 and was kicked off his mom’s insurance, he started rationing his life-saving insulin. He died a month later. The text is mostly accurate, although it has Smith’s given name wrong (it was Alec, not Alex), and he died in 2017, not “this year” as claimed in the 2018 meme. According to local news reports, Alec Raeshawn Smith’s lifeless body was found in his apartment on 27 June 2017, 27 days after his coverage under his mother’s health insurance policy had lapsed due to his age. The cause of death was diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces excess blood acids (called ketones) because it lacks enough insulin. In a piece contributed to Truthout.org in February 2018, Smith’s mother, Nicole Smith-Holt, wrote that even though Alec had a full-time job, it did not come with employer-provided health coverage: For Alec, this meant that his insulin and supplies cost almost $1,300 a month. He and I together researched for months in advance about his health insurance options. They weren’t good. The best plan we found would cost him $450 a month for the premium with a whopping $7,600 deductible. That deductible meant he would be paying out-of-pocket for his medicine for many months anyway, so he decided to go without the plan until he could find a different job with benefits. The prohibitive cost drove Smith to ration his insulin use to try to make his supply stretch to the next payday. “I have since learned that this is not uncommon,” Smith-Holt wrote, and is indicative of a worsening health care crisis: Globally, half of the people who need insulin can’t reliably get access to it. With 6 million people in the US insulin-dependent, and nearly 40 percent of Americans uninsured or facing high deductibles that leave their medicine costs uncovered, the crisis is occurring right here, too. Endocrinologists here in the US report that as many as one in five of their patients are not able to afford their insulin. For many persons with diabetes, that means they land in the emergency room with diabetic ketoacidosis. For others, like Alec, they never get there. Just 27 days after his coverage under my insurance ended, I received the call no parent ever wants to get. The American Diabetes Association released a report in March 2018 estimating that the total costs of diagnosed diabetes in the United States had risen 26 percent in the previous five years: People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of $16,752 per year, of which about $9,601 is attributed to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures approximately 2.3 times higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes…. People with diabetes who do not have health insurance have 60% fewer physician office visits and are prescribed 52% fewer medications than people with insurance coverage — but they also have 168% more emergency department visits than people who have insurance.",0
"""Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott says his opponent Alex Sink wants to cut Medicare benefits for the country's seniors. Sink says Scott is making that up. Enter PolitiFact Florida. The back-and-forth started on Sept. 1, 2010, when Scott issued a press statement commenting on the decision of Bud Chiles to drop his independent candidacy for governor and endorse Sink. """"This (election) will be a contest which presents a clear choice between a conservative outsider with business experience and a specific plan to create 700,000 jobs, and another liberal Obamacrat who wants to raise taxes, cut Medicare, and supports Obama's failed stimulus,"""" Scott said. Sink responded to the Medicare line the next morning. """"I don't even know where he got that from,"""" Sink said in Tallahassee. """"Of course I don't want to cut Medicare."""" Does Sink want to cut Medicare? The Scott campaign pointed PolitiFact Florida to President Barack Obama's major health care legislation as evidence to back up their allegation. According to Scott-think, the linkage works like this: Sink supported the federal health care bill, and the health care bill cuts Medicare. Therefore Sink supports Medicare cuts. On the first part, Sink issued a tepid endorsement of the health care bill on March 22, 2010. """"Though it is certainly not perfect, these long-overdue reforms are better than Washington continuing to do nothing to improve America's health care system,"""" Sink said in part. You can read the rest of it here. The issue, in our minds, really boils down to the health care bill and how it affects Medicare. Medicare and the 2010 health care bill  Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up 12 percent of the federal budget. Naturally, Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation. """"Some (reforms) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage,"""" said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. """"Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care."""" Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen. The 2010 law includes a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D. Currently, after an initial benefit period, enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage. The rebate is meant to begin to close in a hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries. By 2020, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap. The health reform bill also reduces the growth in Medicare spending by more than $500 billion over 10 years, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. Nearly $220 billion in savings comes from reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion for increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. And then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. They typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. A June 2009 MedPAC analysis said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use. """"We do think that systems like Medicare are very inefficient right now, but it has nothing to do at the moment with issues of benefits,"""" Obama said in Aug. 11, 2009, speech in New Hampshire. """"The inefficiencies all come from things like paying $177 billion to insurance companies in subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage that is not competitively bid, so insurance companies basically get $177 billion of taxpayer money to provide services that Medicare already provides. And it's no better -- it doesn't result in better health care for seniors. It is a giveaway of $177 billion."""" The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs and institutes other rules for the program. Generally speaking, the extra payments phase out over the next three to six years. In a few cases, plans will be able to keep current funding if they qualify for special bonuses  """"How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen -- but is expected to vary across the country,"""" Neuman said. """"The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans, and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees, on average. It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline -- which may or may not be a concern. On average, Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010."""" PolitiFact has waded into this ground before whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut. Most experts we talked to had the same answer: yes and no. On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. Still, changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants. The basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same, but the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage would likely be reduced, experts said. """"The core benefits of Medicare won't change,"""" said Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, an advocate for health care consumers. """"Most (Medicare Advantage) plans are solid and resemble traditional Medicare."""" However, some insurance plans have entered the program """"to make a quick buck. They may have to reconsider their budget, which could mean some patients will see changes in the services provided above and beyond traditional Medicare."""" Stuart Guterman, assistant vice president for the Commonwealth Fund’s program on payment system reform, had a similar view. """"People enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) get services that people in traditional care do not get under Medicare,"""" he said. """"Insurance companies can afford to cover these services because taxpayer money is subsidizing them. Plans will most likely not offer those extra services, but in no case will (patients) get less Medicare benefits than people in the rest of the program."""" That's a key distinction when analyzing Scott's comments. Any cuts, if you can call them cuts, in the federal health care bill will happen to extra benefits for Medicare Advantage participants, experts say. Not the traditional Medicare program and the traditional Medicare benefits. Our ruling We must note that Medicare is a federal program, not a state one, so Sink wouldn't be able to cut benefits -- even if she wanted to -- if she's elected in November. Scott's basis for claiming that Sink supports cuts is that she supported the 2010 federal health care legislation that implemented a number of changes to the Medicare program. There are potential cuts coming to the extra benefits received by Medicare Advantage enrollees. But the law does not alter basic Medicare benefits, and actually increases some prescription drug benefits. Because she was not a member of Congress, Sink did not cast a vote for or against the new health law. Additionally, her endorsement was tepid: She said it was better than nothing and """"far from perfect."""" On Medicare, she praised the part of the bill that spends more money on prescription drugs for seniors, and didn't say anything about the cuts for Medicare Advantage. In short, we don't think there's a credible case to be made that Sink supported that part of the bill. The distance between Sink and cuts to Medicare is just too great. We rate Scott's statement .""",1
"11/13/03: Ryan is out of the coma and continuing to make progress. He is being cared for at home, can speak, respond to other around him, and is showing lots of evidence that “Ryan” is fully there. He has made amazing progress but still has some distance to go and hurdles to overcome toward full recovery.. Much of the world has been kept up-to-date on Ryan’s progress through several appearances by Pat Boone and other family members on CNN’s Larry King show. Ryan is 25 years old and on 6/19/01was sun-tanning with friends on the roof of the condo in Southern California where he lives. There is a skylight on the roof and nobody knows exactly how, because his friends were walking ahead of him, but Ryan accidentally fell through the skylight to a cement floor more than 3 stories below. He struck some stairway guardrails on the way down, which helped break his fall, but he hit the floor with such an impact that paramedics who arrived on the scene thought he was beyond hope. In the intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center, there were other moments when hope seemed to be beyond reach, but Ryan has miraculously survived minute-by-minute from collapsed lungs, kidney failure, heart stoppage, having his spleen removed, and brain surgery. His skull was crushed in the fall but, amazingly, there were no other broken bones. Comments",0
"While this story focused on what researchers believed is a new form of vertigo, they did mention that it could be treated by an unnamed medication. The story should have named the medication, and the cost. The story fails to provide clear information on benefits. It does effectively quantify the number of patients in the study thought to have this new form of vertigo — 35 — and also cited how many patients with it who appeared to benefit from the unnamed medication — one-third of 20. It’s worth noting that those suspected of having this new form of vertigo comprise only 10 percent of those recruited in the study, and only two percent of the total recruited were successfully treated by the unnamed medication. The story focuses on the diagnosis of a suspected new form of vertigo so possible false diagnoses are a possible harm. And, the unnamed medication likely carries side effects. The story provides little about the quality of the evidence behind this diagnosis, and the treatment for it. For starters, it would have been helpful to have more information about how this “study” was conducted–was it randomized and controlled? What were the limitations? There is no pathophysiological or biological basis for the disease and only the vaguest of information about the disease as being defined simply by an abnormal test. The story should have provided some counter-balance to this viewpoint — is it really a new diagnosis? The story provides only one source — a member of the research team — and no independent sources. It doesn’t disclose who funded the study, either. The story describes a proposed new diagnosis so suggesting alternatives doesn’t apply. The mechanism for diagnosis of this supposed new form of vertigo is explained by both the news story and the original paper. It requires some sort of audio-visual equipment to record eye movements, and there was discussion of a non-named medication providing relief. There is not enough information to fully inform the reader about the availability of getting screened for this type of vertigo, nor how to treat it. The diagnosis of a new form of a medical condition, if confirmed by later research, seems novel enough to justify news coverage. This story seems to rely heavily on information from a news release. It lifts a quote directly from an American Academy of Neurology news release–without attribution–and appears to have borrowed several descriptions with only limited rewriting. For example, this quote that appears in the story: “These conditions can be difficult to diagnose and quite debilitating for people, so it’s exciting to be able to discover this new diagnosis of a condition that may respond to treatment,” said Dr. Ji-Soo Kim, a researcher at Seoul National University in South Korea. Also appears in the news release.",1
"""Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got into a tussle over their differing foreign policy visions at the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. Sanders criticized Clinton for being too hawkish in the Middle East. """"I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be,"""" he said Dec. 19. """"Yes, we could get rid of (former Iraqi leader) Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region. Yes, we could get rid of (former Libyan dictator Muammar) Gaddafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes, we could get rid of (Syrian dictator Bashar) Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after."""" Clinton shot back, """"With all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gaddafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution."""" We wondered if Clinton was right -- that Sanders previously wanted the Libyan leader gone, even though he now views Gaddafi’s ousting as a cautionary tale. The vote The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi, who had held power for decades. The uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled Gaddafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him the following October. Congress never voted to authorize U.S. military action in Libya, so what is Clinton talking about? On March 1, 2011, the Senate approved a resolution """"strongly condemning the gross and systematic violations of human rights in Libya."""" The Senate approved the resolution by unanimous consent, so senators never actually voted on it. But Sanders showed his support by joining in as one of 10 cosponsors. The resolution called for peaceful regime change, saying Gaddafi should """"desist from further violence, recognize the Libyan people’s demand for democratic change, resign his position and permit a peaceful transition to democracy."""" A Senate resolution carries very little weight. It has no legal teeth and is more like a statement expressing the general """"sense of Congress,"""" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. """"In effect, all this resolution does is say, ‘Gaddafi is a bad person and should stop,’ """" Huder said, noting that this document cannot be interpreted as expression of congressional intent to take specific action to oust Gaddafi. Sanders’ campaign said Clinton was misrepresenting his record because the Senate resolution was nonbinding and not a show of support for U.S. military action. In a March 28, 2011, interview, Sanders described his position toward regime change in Libya. He wanted Gaddafi gone, but not at all costs. """"Look, everybody understands Gaddafi is a thug and murderer,"""" Sanders said to Fox News. """"We want to see him go, but I think in the midst of two wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan), I'm not quite sure we need a third war, and I hope the president tells us that our troops will be leaving there, that our military action in Libya will be ending very, very shortly."""" Clinton also said Sanders’ vote signaled support for United Nations action to get rid of Gaddafi. The Senate resolution asked """"the United Nations Security Council to take such further action as may be necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory."""" The two related U.N. resolutions -- 1970 and 1973 -- called for drastic measures to pressure Gaddafi to stop his alleged human rights abuses, including establishing a no-fly zone and imposing an asset freeze on members of the regime. Neither resolution explicitly call for regime change, though. But Clinton as secretary of state and leaders from other countries did use the two U.N. resolutions as a platform to take actions that they hoped would pressure Gaddafi to step down and allow a transition to democracy. """"While our military mission is focused on saving lives, we must continue to pursue the broader goal of a Libya that belongs not to a dictator, but to the Libyan people,"""" Clinton said at the International Conference on Libya March 29, 2011. Our ruling Clinton said Sanders """"voted for regime change with respect to Libya."""" The reality is a bit more complicated than the sound bite. Sanders supported a non-binding Senate resolution that called on Gaddafi to resign his post in a peaceful, democratic transition of power. While the Senate passed the resolution by unanimous consent -- meaning no one actually voted on it -- Sanders was one of 10 cosponsors. At the time, Sanders told the media he wanted Gaddafi out of power, but it might not be worth it if it required sustained U.S. military involvement. We rate Clinton's statement .""",0
"In September 2017, the Facebook page The Crisis Actor falsely reported that a woman photographed at the scene of a bomb attack in London days earlier was, in fact, an American actor who was taking part in a hoax. Their post accompanied a photograph of a woman incorrectly identified as an “actress” named Nora Kirkpatrick, who portrayed Esther Bruegger in the NBC television series The Office and plays accordion with Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros:   The Crisis Actor’s Facebook post, which has since been deleted, also included a series of other claims and rhetorical questions intended to suggest that the 15 September 2017 bomb attack on a London Underground train at Parsons Green was a hoax. We will individually address each of these claims, which we have found to all be either false, misleading, or irrelevant. The woman whose image was widely used in coverage of the bomb attack is not the American actor Nora Kirkpatrick. This becomes quite clear when  her appearance is compared to that of Kirkpatrick‘s. Indeed, in response to our queries the Crisis Actor accepted that the two pictured women are not the same person. A Facebook post issued by Kirkpatrick on 15 September 2017  suggested she was in Los Angeles at the time of the attack, not in London. The other claims made in the now-deleted Crisis Actor post included the following: 1. One of the “PC’s” was wearing jeans. In response to our request for evidence documenting this statement, the Crisis Actor directed us to a PA Images photograph taken on the day of the attack, which seemingly shows a PC (i.e., police constable) clad in jeans. However, there are several non-suspect explanations for why a police officer might be wearing jeans at a given moment, and in this case the photograph shows four police officers at work near the site of the bomb attack who apparently were simply wearing plain clothes at that moment. In any case, it stretches credulity to propose that an extremely complicated “false flag” operation orchestrated by sophisticated forces such as the Metropolitan Police and U.K. intelligence services were caught out because a participant slipped up and forgot to wear the right trousers. 2. The police car registration number LX13 AOS shown in the incident is a hire car from a film props company. The reg is up for tax next year. The police do not tax their vehicles. This statement is demonstrably false. We found one photograph of a vehicle that may have borne this license plate (i.e., registration) number: A police van seen on the right-hand side of a PA Images photograph taken near Parsons Green on the day of the attack appears to bear the license plate LX13 AOS. However, this van (a Vauxhall Vivaro) has been part of the British Transport Police fleet since at least as far back as May 2014, according to the British Transport Police;s response to a Freedom of Information request. In response to our questions, the Crisis Actor admitted that the police van “seems to be a bogus lead” and accepted that it “appears” to be an authentic police vehicle rather than a rented prop. 3. The lady pictured with her “burnt” ear in a bandage … was pictured using her phone next to the same ear. It’s not clear from the photograph how badly the woman in question was hurt, nor exactly what part of her head might have been injured. If she was photographed using a cellphone, it’s not possible to draw any conclusions about what that means: she might have placed the phone next to an uninjured ear, or her ear may not have sustained damage so severe that using it with a cellphone was necessarily difficult or painful (especially in the context of an emergency during which contacting loved ones would likely have been a priority). The Crisis Actor directed us to a photograph that appeared on the Metro news web site, but that image was too blurry to definitively identify whether the woman captured on a cell phone in the background of that photograph was the same woman pictured the photograph used in the Crisis Actor’s Facebook post. 4. The “gas” ignited inside the whole length of a train carriage with the doors closed. But why no smoke, no heat damage to the carriage, papers unburnt on the floor, no windows blown out, no deafened “victims”. This aspect of the Parsons Green attack is one most commonly cited as evidence the incident was a staged hoax. The failure of the bomb to cause extensive damage to the interior of the train carriage, the survival of the plastic bag and bucket that contained the bomb, the absence of plumes of smoke in the aftermath of the bomb, and the widespread lack of visible scorching on victims — elements familiar from the scenes of many homemade bomb attacks in confined spaces — are genuinely puzzling at first glance. We consulted explosives expert Dr. Sidney Alford about this aspect, who proposed some possible explanations for the absence of damage often observed in homemade bombs. Primarily, Alford said, the evidence he had seen in news reports about the Parsons Green attack appeared consistent with a TATP (triacetone triperoxide) device that simply did not detonate properly. We have highlighted observations made by Dr. Alford which are particularly relevant to the points made by Parsons Green conspiracy theorists: Traditional military explosives such as are (or were) used in artillery shells and aircraft bombs usually contained substances, such as TNT and ammonium picrate, which were not oxygen balanced; that is, the carbon to oxygen balance is very high and their detonation is characterized by the production of a lot of carbon, whence the copious black smoke (and usually a fire-ball) produced. This is not a characteristic of all explosives however and TATP does not decompose to a similar extent: indeed, it produces very little if any smoke. Neither does it produce a significant flash. Unlike TNT, which it is very difficult to cause to explode by hammering on a metal surface, and which burns quietly, TATP is notoriously sensitive to friction and percussion, most of which cause it to detonate. There are several factors which can cause TATP to be less susceptible to detonation of which the amateur is frequently unaware. In the present case I expect that the person who prepared the bomb had little previous experience either of its preparation or of its use. It is quite probable that no detonation occurred and such explosion as did occur was only deflagration – that is, rapid burning. The little damage done to the overall package and its contents show unambiguously that no large and violent explosion occurred. No shock-wave and no volume of gaseous products sufficient to break windows were generated. Clearly many passengers received quite a shock and heard something of a bang. However, I have not seen any reports of damaged ear drums or fragment injuries. The big question as far as I was concerned was the nature of the apparently remaining contents of the bottom of the bag. It is possible that that was a much larger quantity of TATP than the part which obviously decomposed with some violence. It is equally possible that only a modest amount TATP was present and that that was intended to initiate a larger amount of another explosive beneath it. In other words, the TATP was a mere booster. My own observations of one or two newspaper photographs of the passengers who were obviously injured and “burnt” in fact suggested that they may have consisted of chemical “burns” rather than wounds attributable to exposure to very high temperatures. Indeed, the injuries to the legs of a boy being carried by two uniformed helpers appeared to me (on the rather poor photograph) to resemble the injuries caused by concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution. If this interpretation is correct then the bang which passengers reported was merely the means of ignition of the TATP, the visible white substance was unreacted TATP, and the main charge remained uninitiated in the bottom part of the bag. Little if any blast damage occurred and few if any serious fragment projection injuries were caused. I see no reason why the event should be described as a hoax. Had the type of bomb I suspect detonated then the windows would, indeed, have broken, the carriage burst open and many passengers dismembered.",1
"""Donald Trump called the Affordable Care Act a """"disaster"""" that he wants to repeal and that Hillary Clinton would make health care even worse. """"She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster,"""" Trump said during the presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis Oct. 9. """"Somewhat similar to Canada. And if you ever noticed the Canadians -- when they need a big operation when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow, it's catastrophic in certain ways. But, she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything."""" Does Clinton want to move the United States to a single-payer system for health care? Clinton’s health care plan Converting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies. Some Democrats — including, at one time, Barack Obama — pushed for a single-payer system. But there wasn’t enough support for that, and ultimately Congress approved a plan that allows different insurance plans offered in """"marketplaces"""" by individual states and the federal government. During the vice presidential debate, Trump’s running mate Gov. Mike Pence made a similar claim that Clinton and and Tim Kaine """"want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program."""" For our fact-check of Pence, Trump spokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website. It indicates """"that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare,"""" Kowalski said. """"A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery."""" Here is exactly what she said on her campaign website about a public option: """"Defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million people. Hillary will stand up to Republican-led attacks on this landmark law—and build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a """"public option"""" possible. She will also support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare."""" So Clinton does want a public option, but she is calling for adding the public option to the existing options. Clinton has consistently said, including during the Oct. 9 debate, that she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans. She has called for expanding it to include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries with cheaper prices. We previously asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal. Kowalski responded that """"Hillary has committed fully to the public option,"""" and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady. At the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, """"I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I don’t think it’s — I don’t even think it’s a close call politically."""" Later in her answer Clinton says there are three ways to get universal health coverage, only one of which is a single-payer system. The other two: an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works. WikiLeaks speech excerpt about single-payer A few days after the vice presidential debate, WikiLeaks published emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. A Jan. 25 email from Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk to Podesta contained excerpts of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speeches but hasn’t done so.) One excerpt related to single-payer systems was from remarks she gave to """"ECGR Grand Rapids"""" on June 17, 2013. She gave a speech to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids in Michigan that day. """"If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here."""" We can’t fully evaluate Clinton’s speech because WikiLeaks published only excerpts. (We asked the Clinton campaign for a fully copy but did not get a response to that request.) However, Clinton praised single-payer because she says it keeps costs down, but she also said that it imposes wait times. And she also praised systems like Switzerland for having clear budget controls and said they don’t have single payer. Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us a brief fact-check in Politico that was headlined: """"No, Clinton has not been after single payer for years."""" One final note: Trump has been all over the map on single-payer health care if we trace his comments back to his first race for president in 2000. """"The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. … We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing,"""" Trump wrote in his 2000 book The America We Deserve. Other times in the past couple of years he has praised it, but he has also said he doesn’t support it. His campaign plan on his website emphasizes """"free market principles."""" Our ruling Trump says Clinton """"wants to go to a single-payer plan"""" for health care. She has consistently said she would fight efforts to repeal Obamacare and would try to improve it. She said she wants a public option to be """"possible"""" but she has not  called for moving to a system of only single payer. Clinton has not called for a single-payer plan. At times, she has praised the health care systems of other countries that have a single-payer plan, but she has not advocated that plan for the United States.""",1
"Forms of a “carjacking” alert have been kicking around the Internet since at least February 2004, even though what they describe might more accurately be described as a form of automobile theft rather than a form of carjacking (which involves threatening or attacking the driver of a vehicle to force him out of his car):  Imagine: You walk across the parking lot, unlock your car and get inside. Then you lock all your doors, start the engine and shift into REVERSE. Habit! You look into the rear-view window to back out of your parking space and you notice a piece of paper, some sort of advertisement stuck to your rear window. So, you shift into PARK, unlock your doors and jump out of your vehicle to remove that paper (or whatever it is) that is obstructing your view … when you reach the back of your car, that is when the car-jackers jump out of nowhere … jump into your car and take off — your engine was running, your purse is in the car, and they practically mow you down as they speed off in your car. BE AWARE OF THIS NEW SCHEME  Just drive away and remove the paper that is stuck to your window later … and be thankful that you read this email and that you forwarded it to your friends. Please beware that my daughter was coming out of the West York Wal-Mart tonight and as she was walking to her car she noticed that a couple of guys were watching her, she got into her car and locked her doors. As she was leaving she saw what appeared to be a 100.00 dollar bill on her windshield, she was smart enough not to get out of her car at the time because she remember a email that I sent her not that long ago about people putting something on the windshield and when the person gets out to retrieve it they are car jacked. Here’s a pic of the fake money….be careful. Ever since the earliest warnings of this putative form of crime hit the Internet, we have been following news reports for any documented instances of an actual car theft (either perpetrated or merely attempted) that followed the script outlined in the widely-spread e-mailed caution, but we have yet to turn up evidence of so much as one. Were this “lure motorists from their vehicles by leaving flyers on their rear windows, then drive off with their cars” method as commonly in play as suggested in the example above, that surely would not have been the case. Nothing rules out there having been a few thefts carried out in the manner described that we have yet to hear about. But even if that proved to be the case, there is clearly no crime wave, no ever-present danger to motorists everywhere, no flyer-armed menace lurking in the nation’s parking lots. Our law enforcement contacts have also noted that although the process described above could be used by carjackers, they were unfamiliar with any cases of cars being taken in this manner, and the scheme outlined ran contrary to their experience of how carjackers operate. Specifically, they said that carjackings are generally crimes of opportunity, committed by persons in need of quick cash or youngsters either out for a thrill or participating in some rite of passage (such as a gang initiation). Carjackers tend to hang around places where motorists have to stop or exit their vehicles (e.g., intersections, gas stations, car washes, ATMs, freeway on- and off-ramps) and then force the drivers out of their automobiles (or simply take off with the temporarily unoccupied cars). Running around parking lots sticking flyers on windshields and then hanging around to wait for drivers to return to their vehicles involves planning and exposure atypical of most carjackers; they’re more likely to approach occupied vehicles (particularly luxury cars with high resale value) and force the drivers out (by threatening them with weapons and/or physically pulling them out of their seats). They acknowledged, however, that as improvements in car alarms, locking devices, and other anti-theft systems have made it harder to steal unoccupied vehicles, car thieves (i.e., those who boost vehicles on a regular basis, without the use of violence or weaponry) may be resorting to alternative methods such as the one described above. However, attracting attention by plastering parked cars with flyers or fake money, hanging around waiting for the drivers of those vehicles to return to their autos, and hoping that those motorists don’t remove what was left on their windshields or windows before entering their cars (rather than afterwards) isn’t a terribly efficient scheme for grand theft auto. This alert has gained a measure of credibility thanks to it having been forwarded by members of the law enforcement community. Illinois State Police Master Sgt. Terry Granell received the warning via the usual method (a friend e-mailed it to him), thought it something he should pass along to his daughters, and so unthinkingly volleyed it to them from his work account, which automatically appended his official signature block to the mailing. Taking their dad’s e-mail for an official announcement from the Illinois State Police about a mode of crime that agency was dealing with, the alarmed girls passed along the heads up about leaflet-armed carjackers to their friends, who in turn loosed it upon a wider audience. As it sped from one inbox to the next, the alert was presumed authentic because it carried the contact information for a real police officer. Yet appearances to the contrary, Sgt. Granell’s e-mail wasn’t an official statement made on behalf of the Illinois State Police about a form of crime it had noted and wanted the public to guard itself against, it was merely the passing along of a dubious e-mail by a private citizen who just happened to be a police officer. Later versions of this e-mail identified Sgt. Granell as being a member of the Louisiana State Patrol or Louisiana State Police. One of the many versions in circulation commenced:  Detective Bledsoe, of the Florissant, MO Sheriff’s office confirms that this is happening in St. Louis County, Missouri and could be happening near you, so be careful and take note. Leutenant Tony Bartholome of the Missouiri Highway Patrol urges everyone to keep this email circulating — the more people who are aware of this MO, the better. Description of new carjacking scheme:  The Florissant (Missouri) Police Department posted a denial of this claim on their web site:  ERRONEOUS E-MAIL CAUSES ALARM IN CITY OF FLORISSANT Chief William Karabas of the Florissant Police Department wants to make the public aware of an erroneous e-mail circulating in reference to auto thefts, specifically ‘car jacking’ incidents in the City of Florissant. “I want to put an end to this rumor. The City of Florissant has not had any incidents of this nature!”, said Chief Karabas. In fact, the e-mail makes reference to many false claims. Chief Karabas stated, “Some of the points include, referring to the Florissant Police Department as a Sheriffs Department, which we are not, we DO NOT have a Detective Bledsoe, there is NO State Trooper named Bartholome, there is NO Missouri Neighborhood Watch Association, there is NO such address (1456 Washington Ave) in Florissant and the telephone number given on the e-mail is NOT IN SERVICE!”  Again, there is NO validity to this e-mail. It is FALSE. We ask that people be informed and get the correct information. One way to check e-mails for validity is to call your police department or go on-line to check â? ?Urban Legendsâ?? at www.snopes.com  Detective Bledsoe of the infamous warning notoriety is an actual police officer, but he serves with the Montgomery County (Texas) Sheriff’s Office, not the Florissant Police Department. (Montgomery County is just north of Houston.) He came to have this Internet can tied to his tail after receiving the “carjackers using flyers to lure victims from their vehicles” warning in his e-mail in February 2005 and sending it to some friends as an example of what possibly could happen, not realizing that his official signature block would be automatically appended to his forward. He has no personal knowledge of carjackings being carried out by this method, he has not been party to any such investigations, nor was his e-mail meant as an official alert on behalf of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office. Since February 2005, Det. Bledsoe has fielded more than 300 phone calls about the warning many presume he authored, with inquiries coming in from all over the country. There is a Lt. Tony Bartolome, but he’s with the Florida Highway Patrol, not Missouri’s. His involvement with the e-mail began in 2004. As Lt. Bartolome stated on the FHP web site: “I got that information four and half years ago from the San Diego police. I passed it on to a couple of friends. I wish I’d never sent it.”  San Diego police Sergeant Jim Shorr said he’s seen the message on the Internet, but to his knowledge San Diego hasn’t had any cases like it. “It was attributed to us,” he said. “But I don’t know where it came from.”  New Zealand experienced a resurgence of the rumor in 2009 when a version in circulation that included the name of a police employee and the NZ Police logo made the rounds. The New Zealand Police said that the rumor “is an urban myth”:  Police are urging people who receive an email about tactics used in supposed ‘carjackings’ to delete it rather than forwarding it to friends and family, as it is an urban myth. The email has been around for some time and appears to be experiencing another circulation surge at the moment. It gained momentum earlier this year as it contains the name of a Police employee and the NZ Police logo — lending it credibility. The email was passed on, albeit with the best of intentions, by the employee, gaining the staff member’s details and Police logo in the process. The email warns recipients to be on the lookout for a piece of paper stuck to the rear window of their vehicle, seen only as they back out of parking spaces. The scenario suggests people then get out of their vehicle to remove the piece of paper, leaving keys in the ignition, the engine running and their bags/purses and other valuables in the car. When the vehicle owner gets out of their car, waiting ‘offenders’ then take the car and its contents. Police say it is easy for people to be taken in by such stories, evidenced by the fact a Police employee saw fit to forward the email on. Police say it’s simply not good practice to exit a vehicle with keys in the ignition, the engine running and valuables inside. In December 2009 the e-mail was attributed to Mark Scheck, an officer with the RCMP in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While the officer is real, his connection with the e-mail was not, as an article in the Wetaskiwin Times confirmed.",1
"""Republicans like to say the government is spending like a drunken sailor. Democrats say the government needs to keep spending, albeit strategically, to jolt job creation. It’s all relative to political persuasion and the economic theories that partisans follow. But congressman John Boehner, a southwestern Ohio Republican who just became speaker of the House of Representatives, provides a perspective that Americans outside of Washington  might not think about. """"Our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy,"""" Boehner said in his inaugural remarks upon accepting the speaker’s gavel. """"Hard work and tough decisions will be required of the 112th Congress."""" There are certain assumptions built into this claim about the extent of the government’s debt, although they are widely held and agreed to by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and President Barack Obama’s commission on reducing the deficit and debt. But before going there, we thought we’d look at Boehner’s statement in its most simplistic interpretation. The United States government’s total debt on the day Boehner took over as speaker was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s interactive """"Debt to the Penny"""" website. The size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis databases. Using only these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the  end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury’s calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. Boehner said """"soon,"""" so he was correct: $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy signals the onset of an eclipse. Economists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, """"Wait!"""" We understand. Some government debt is considered way more troubling than other, and many analysts say that only part of it should be used when measuring its size against the total economy. A mercifully short primer: Federal debt has two major components, namely, debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. Public debt is money the government owes to the public, including foreigners who buy government T bills and retirees who want safe government bonds. The government sells them these bills and bonds and uses the money to operate. But like a loan, the money must be paid back in real cash. Intragovernmental holdings involve such things as Social Security Trust Fund IOU’s and other transfers between divisions of the government. These borrowings must be repaid, too, but they don’t put an immediate crimp on the government, and they often are handled by shuffling paper back and forth between departments, despite the future perils that may hold (the piper must be paid eventually, and all that). In other words, the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, and that has a faster ripple effect in the private sector. So we go back to that Treasury calculator to see how much money this might involve. It shows that the public debt on the day that Boehner took control of the House was nearly $9.4 trillion. It was $9.069 trillion as of the end of last October, when the GDP was $14.745 trillion, or nearly 62 percent of the GDP. That’s a high debt-to-GDP ratio by historic standards, although it was much higher at the end of World War II, when the debt did in fact exceed the nation’s GDP. But what worries Boehner and many others is the projection that the public debt could reach World War II proportions again. If current practices aren’t changed, debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama’s national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December. Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, told us the public debt could reach 100 percent of GDP by then, """"and if you add in state and local debt, it could be as early as 2016, 2017 or 2018."""" And if this trend were to continue? Unless Congress made some big changes, """"the federal debt would balloon to 185 percent of GDP by 2035,"""" said the CBO. The president’s commission used the same warning. Would this automatically be catastrophic? That depends on the government’s choices. For a parallel, consider the mortgage on a house, which often exceeds the owner’s income by 200 percent or 300 percent. The problem is that if there are other debts and the car breaks down and Junior suddenly needs braces, the homeowner is likely to have a problem that limits his financial and lifestyle options. For the government, this would likely drive up interest rates as the government competed with the private sector to borrow money, and crimp economic growth. It could result in tax hikes, spending cuts and stingier government entitlements, analysts say.. It needs to be noted that these projections are based on the most dire projections that use a set of what-ifs, and rosier estimates show up, in fact, in current budget documents. But the what-ifs come from realistic expectations about the way Washington operates. For example, the CBO noted that Congress passed tax cuts a decade ago and projected they would only last a decade. Yet Congress just renewed them. Similarly, Congress keeps passing temporary, one-year payment hikes for Medicare doctors who otherwise would see steep cuts -- and might stop caring for seniors. While well-intentioned, this keeps the long-term costs from looking too bad when projecting future budgets, despite the fact that renewal is a near certainty every single year. The CBO doesn’t say this is nefarious; it just says that continuation of these kinds of practices has consequences. So what of Boehner’s claim that the debt will """"soon"""" eclipse the size of the economy? We are not endorsing or rejecting Boehner’s proposed solutions or his analysis of the policies that led to the problem. Democrats blame the war in Iraq and the tax cuts of former President George W. Bush, while Republicans blame spending by Democrats and President Barack Obama’s White House. Some economists suggest that with sensible policy changes and an economy that eventually turns robust, these fears will never come to pass. But when the nonpartisan CBO and the Democratic president’s fiscal commission agree with the Republican leader on the scope of the problem, both citing the prospect public debt at 185 percent of GDP, the Truth-O-Meter must concur that his prediction is reasonable.""",0
"""It’s become Gov. Rick Scott’s favorite talking point in the escalating debate over raising rates at Citizens Property Insurance: The state-run insurer has a whopping $500 billion in risk exposure, and a paltry $6 billion in surplus, or cash-on-hand. In interviews, at Cabinet meetings and even in a pop-quiz-styled survey to the Florida Council of 100, Scott repeatedly uses these two numbers to illustrate the financial health of Citizens. """"I’m not sure how much smaller Citizens can get. But here’s the position Citizens is in now,"""" Scott said during a May trip to the Florida Keys. """"They have over $500 billion worth of risk, with less than $10 billion worth of surplus. So that’s a lot of risk, and I think one of the most important things homeowners want is if there ever is a disaster that their insurance company is going to be able to pay the bill."""" In a survey given to the Florida Council of 100 last month, Scott got more specific, stating that the state-run insurer had $504.8 billion in total risk exposure and only $6.1 billion in cash surplus. It’s a jarring numerical juxtaposition used to show that Citizens is severely undercapitalized and, if a major hurricane hits, would spur untold financial calamity for the state. Fearing so-called """"hurricane taxes,"""" Scott asked the Citizens board of governors to find ways to drastically reduce the company’s size and exposure late last year. (Citizens currently has issued about 1.4 million policies.) The board came up with more than 30 proposals, most of which would lead to increased rates or reduced coverage for policyholders. To justify those painful rate hikes, proponents point to the weak financial position of Citizens, often comparing its cash on hand to its maximum exposure. A growing chorus of critics say Scott and insurance industry insiders are using exaggerated, apocalyptic language to incite fear and justify large increases on insurance premiums. The numbers are extreme, to say the least. After six years without a single hurricane hitting Florida, could Citizens’ finances really be that frightful? We did a little digging and found that Scott’s statements about Citizens’ financial assets and liabilities, while technically true, omit major components of the financial structure of Citizens. First, on the side of Citizens’ """"surplus."""" The state-run insurer does, indeed, have nearly $6 billion in cash reserves, money it has been able to build up during the last six hurricane-free years. But that cash— the most Citizens has ever had--is only part of the pot the insurer uses to pay hurricane claims. Few, if any, property insurers rely solely on cash surplus to pay claims in the wake of catastrophe. Citizens, like every other licensed property insurer in Florida, has backup insurance from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. It also has private reinsurance worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Finally, Citizens has the ability to sell bonds to pay the cover claims that exceed its surplus and reinsurance coverage. Altogether, Citizens has about $19.5 billion in claims-paying ability, more than three times the amount cited by the governor. Most of that could be paid out before any assessments, or """"hurricane taxes"""" would be required from non-Citizens policyholders. The other half of Scott’s statement mentions that Citizens has $500 billion in total exposure to risk. This is also true, but it has little to do with whether Citizens """"is going to be able to pay the bill"""" after a storm. What would it take for Florida to actually have to pay out $500 billion in claims? A superstorm 25 times as ferocious as Hurricane Andrew would have to hit South Florida, and zigzag its way through Florida’s peninsula, hitting all 67 counties and damaging or destroying every home and business with a Citizens policy. A series of back-to-back, Andrew-sized storms up and down the state could also do the trick. In the absence of such an apocalyptic occurrence, a more realistic estimate of maximum losses would be the 1-in-100-year storm, the so-called """"Big One,"""" that would cause more damage than Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Estimates indicate that kind of storm -- which only has a 1-percent chance of occurring in a given year -- would cost Citizens a maximum of $21 billion. This number, while large and financially troublesome for Citizens, is nowhere near the $500 billion often repeated by the governor. Scott spokesman Lane Wright said regardless of which numbers are presented, the fact that Citizens remains in a precarious financial position is central. """"No matter how you slice it, in the worst case storm, the one-in-100-year storm, Citizens still falls short of being able to pay its claims,"""" Wright said, adding that Florida could also get hit with several back-to-back storms. """"That’s a fact."""" That’s true -- but those aren’t the words Scott has been using. He’s opted for the gasp-inducing $6-billion-versus-$500-billion language. Our ruling Scott has said repeatedly that Citizens has more than $500 billion worth of risk, but about $6 billion in cash surplus. But the $500-billion number vastly overstates what Citizens might have to pay in even the most vicious storm season imaginable. And the $6-billion figure undercounts Citizens’ ability to pay claims. So those numbers are not the appropriate figures to use when determining whether the insurer """"is going to be able to pay the bill"""" after a storm. More appropriate numbers would compare Citizens’ total claims-paying ability (about $19.5 billion) to the damage caused by a once-in-a-century kind of hurricane (about $21 billion). Scott’s statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",1
"""Much of the discussion about the Clinton family foundation has focused on who donated to it and what they may have expected in return from then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But critics of the Clintons have opened up another line of attack on what is formally known as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, charging that it doesn’t actually spend very much on charitable works. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh aired this line of argument on April 23, 2015, citing a report in the Federalist, a conservative publication. Here’s a portion of what Limbaugh said: """"The Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation -- 99 percent pass-through. The Clinton Family Foundation pass-through is 15 percent. The Federalist reports only 15 percent of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to actual charitable causes. The bulk of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to travel, salaries, and benefits. Sixty percent of all the money raised went to other expenses. In other words, folks, 85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary."""" As this claim was circulating, the Clinton Foundation pushed back. The foundation tweeted, """"More than 88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work."""" The difference between 15 percent and 88 percent is wide, so we decided to check Limbaugh’s claim. A representative with Limbaugh’s radio network didn’t answer an email inquiry. An unusual approach for a foundation When most people in the charitable world think of foundations, they think of organizations that give away a lot of money in the form of grants to others who go out and do good works. The Clinton foundation works differently -- it keeps its money in house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs. This set-up means the Clinton foundation’s finances get complicated in ways other foundations do not. Partly because of that, one of the leading independent groups that track charities -- Charity Navigator -- has been flummoxed about how to analyze that foundation and has stopped rating it, at least for now. Charity Navigator says it has """"determined that this charity's atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model."""" What is counted in the foundation’s financials? The Federalist article that Limbaugh cited dug into the Clinton foundation’s tax forms known as 990s, which nonprofits have to file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. Here’s an excerpt from the Federalist article: """"When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it actually goes toward fat salaries, administrative bloat, and lavish travel. Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants. More than $25 million went to fund travel expenses. Nearly $110 million went toward employee salaries and benefits. And a whopping $290 million during that period — nearly 60 percent of all money raised — was classified merely as ‘other expenses.’ """" The Clinton foundation, on the other hand, gets to its 88 percent going to """"life-changing work"""" by combining the finances of the Clinton Foundation and an affiliated organization, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, that before 2010 had been part of the Clinton Foundation proper. The Clinton Health Access Initiative works with governments and private groups to lower the costs of treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world. The Clinton Health Access Initiative was split off from the foundation because """"they got so big they needed their own organization to do it,"""" said Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, in an interview with PolitiFact. But in putting together its annual report for 2013, the Clinton Foundation folded together both groups before calculating the numbers. Some question the logic for doing it this way. """"Clinton allies are deliberately conflating the activities and finances of multiple independent nonprofit organizations and hoping you'll view everything together as ‘The Clinton Foundation,’ """" Sean Davis, who wrote the Federalist story, told PunditFactc. """"That's just not the case, though."""" The correct number for the Clinton Foundation alone -- which owned the account the tweet was sent from -- was just over 80 percent in 2013, not 88 percent. The Clinton Foundation’s unusual model As we noted earlier, many foundations carry out charitable works by giving money to other organizations that, in turn, do the ground-level charity work, whereas the Clinton foundation’s charitable works are mostly done by people on the foundation’s payroll. """"We are an implementing organization rather than a grantmaking organization,"""" said the foundation’s Minassian. That’s why the Clinton Foundation’s 990s show a relatively small amount of money categorized as """"grants"""" -- only about 10 percent of all expenses in 2013. The foundation says its own employees are doing its charitable work. The annual report -- which, remember, includes both the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- says that 7 percent of expenditures were spent on """"management and expenses"""" and 4.5 percent for """"fundraising."""" (The numbers on the 990s for the two entities are in the same ballpark.) Add those two percentages together and you get almost 12 percent; subtract that from 100 percent and you get the magic 88 percent figure the foundation cited. An independent academic CPA who specializes in nonprofit foundation finances said Limbaugh’s error was in assuming that all spending beyond grants amounted to wasteful overhead. """"When Mr. Limbaugh says most of the spending is on salaries, travel, and other, that is not particularly informative,"""" said Linda Parsons, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Commerce. """"Travel and salaries for those who are directly carrying out the mission of the organization are much different than salaries and travel for executives who are networking in order to raise funds or for those who manage the organization. The response from the Clinton foundation that they carry out their missions directly, rather than outsource it to another organization or series of organizations, makes sense given that the Clinton Foundation reports travel, salaries, depreciation and conferences directly."""" Of course, Parsons’ interpretation depends on trusting the Clinton foundation’s characterization of its expenditures. As with any institution that files tax forms, the Clinton foundation has to characterize on its own what counts as """"management"""" and what counts as spending on front-line charity work. The Federalist article says the foundation’s tweet exaggerates when it says money spent """"directly"""" on """"life-changing work,"""" when in fact the group, by its own calculations, """"spent nearly $8.5 million – 10 percent of all 2013 expenditures – on travel. Do plane tickets and hotel accommodations directly change lives? Nearly $4.8 million – 5.6 percent of all expenditures – was spent on office supplies. Are ink cartridges and staplers ‘life-changing’ commodities?"""" In response to a PolitiFact request, the Clinton Foundation said the expenditures for its programs are """"inclusive of salaries for staff, large-scale conferences (which is how the foundation convenes partners to take action such as the Clinton Global Initiative and the Health Matters conference), training for farmers and other beneficiaries, as well as direct program expenses like purchasing seeds and fertilizer for our agricultural programs and medical equipment for our public health work."""" Reasonable people can disagree about how to categorize expenses, said Janet S. Greenlee, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Dayton business school. """"There is no approved, required, or suggested method for allocating costs between program and nonprogram spending, so two charities that have the same financial events may have totally different financials,"""" Greenlee said. """"Limbaugh is saying everything that’s not direct service must be a waste of money, while the foundation is probably estimating that most of its other costs are actually direct service and so are accounted as such. The ‘truth,’ if there is such a thing, is somewhere in between."""" The foundation sent PolitiFact a rough geographic breakdown for program spending in 2012 and 2013. It cited expenditures split between 66.2 percent for the United States, 18.1 percent for South America, 5.6 percent for Southeast Asia, 4.9 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa, 3.6 percent for Central America and the Caribbean, 1.2 percent for West and Central Africa and 0.4 percent for Mexico. That’s more than we had expected to see in domestic spending -- we’re checking with the foundation on why that was so high, and will report their explanation if we receive one -- but even if the foundation devoted as little as one-third of its expenses to programs outside the U.S., then Limbaugh’s 15 percent estimate would be too low. To offer some context, spending 88 percent of expenses on charitable programs, as the Clinton foundation says it does, would actually be pretty good by industry standards. Parsons said the average reported across all organizations in the National Center for Charitable Statistics is 81 percent -- equal to the Clinton Foundation’s rate on its own -- and the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance suggests a minimum of 65 percent. """"The foundation exceeds that,"""" Parsons said. Our ruling Limbaugh said """"85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary."""" There’s a grain of truth here -- roughly 85 percent of the foundation’s spending was for items other than charitable grants to other organizations, and a large chunk of this 85 percent did go to Clinton Foundation staff for travel, salaries and benefits. However, the foundation says it does most of its charitable work in-house, and it’s not credible to think that the foundation spent zero dollars beyond grants on any charitable work, which is what it would take for Limbaugh to be correct. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",1
"Men undergoing psychiatric treatment sit while waiting to get food at the courtyard of Sarhad Psychiatric Hospital in Peshawar May 12, 2010. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood “He had just told me how it is good to dream and we will achieve our dreams,” said Ramzan, who began sleeping with a gun under his pillow, fearful he too will be killed in Pakistan’s relentless violence. “This man came and asked Noman if he could get a lift on his motorcycle to the police station. When they got there the man blew himself up. Noman and nine other people were killed.”   In the conflict between Taliban insurgents and Pakistan’s army, thousands have been killed in bombings of everything from military and police facilities to crowded street markets; even a volleyball match was attacked. Countless others have been wounded. But the psychological toll often goes unnoticed, even though underfunded and understaffed hospitals are treating a sharply rising number of people who can’t cope with bloodshed. “This is alarming us,” said psychologist Najam Younes. Some people are too depressed to function. Others are gripped by anxiety attacks, paranoia and post traumatic stress disorder. Flashbacks are common. It doesn’t take much to destabilize minds. Even headlines of smaller attacks that flash across news channels are enough to send people to psychiatrists seeking pills to calm them or help them sleep at night. Luckily for Pakistanis, the stigma attached to mental illness has eased, making it easier for them to seek psychiatric care, psychologists say. But the problem is that people caught up in the violence — mostly living in the epicenter of the conflict in the northwest — have no access to psychological care facilities. So they must take long, expensive journeys to cities like Peshawar for treatment. Those who can afford it often don’t get the attention they need because there are too few doctors, who are often overworked and cannot provide therapy, only medicine. Peshawar’s Sarhad Psychiatric Hospital, located on the same complex of a prison where militants awaiting trial and other hard core criminals are held, is one example. It is the only proper mental health facility in the northwest. In the hospital courtyard, patients dulled by medicine sit on a cement floor in rows, quietly staring at each other. Some look lost. Others are suspicious. “Long live Pakistan”, is scribbled on a wall behind them beside a drawing of a flower. In a grim, tiny kitchen nearby, a cook slops stew into a huge pot beside steel bowls. Senior consultant Muhammad Tariq sometimes treats 100 patients a day. He is also the region’s main forensic psychologist, so he must spend time in court. Scant funding at the state hospital means he has no computer to manage files. “There is only so much I can do,” he said. Tariq says 10-15 new patients suffering mentally from the violence arrive every day. Many have lost their homes and livelihood. Still, those are not the worst cases. Handling people rattled by bloodshed who already have mental illnesses is far more challenging. They are the most vulnerable. Muhammad Ikhtiar was lucky enough to have an Islamic charity pay for his schizophrenic son’s medicines. Fighting distressed his son Muhammad’s fragile mind. “Sometimes he is scared of the Taliban and the army. Other times he is convinced he is the commander of the Taliban and the army,” said Ikhtiar, a serious, elderly man with a white beard. Ikhtiar’s problems don’t end there. Taliban militants would often hide in his maize fields, so government forces made him cut down the crop, he said. Now he has to find ways of making a living while caring for his son. Doctors say the patients need family support. But because of the fighting, it’s too dangerous for them to head home. Muhammad Iqbal, a sturdy man wearing a traditional flat wool chitrali hat, suffers from bipolar disorder. His moods often swing from depression to elation. Doctors hope stabilizers will make him realize it’s too risky to return to his four children in North Waziristan, which is infested with al Qaeda and Taliban militants. “Right now he has no idea what is happening,” said the hospital’s Tariq. “He thinks he will return to a peaceful village with a nice forest.”",0
"""Springtime in New Hampshire means motorcyclists are itching to hit the state’s scenic, winding roads. But if they trusted a widely distributed news article last year, they might think they need to install a device that limits their motorcycle to 75 mph – per a federal government regulation – before they can ride. Since the Granite State has the second-highest motorcycle ownership rate nationwide – one bike for every 17 people – a mechanical requirement imposed by the federal Department of Transportation would hit the state especially hard. An estimated $35 price tag for the speed governors would cost New Hampshire’s motorcycle riders more than $2.5 million to bring all 73,000 bikes registered statewide into compliance. It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the 8 million-plus motorcycles across the United States into compliance, based on the article published by Associated Media Coverage. Despite the alarm, there was never any such rule proposed, much less mandated. The apparent news story with the headline """"""""New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017,"""" wasn’t true. There was no requirement to install speed governors, and the article’s lone quoted source, James Littleton, a purported representative of the DOT, doesn’t appear to exist. Nevertheless, it reached nearly 10,000 people – perhaps more though social media – within a matter of days, according to a cached version of the article, which was subsequently removed. Maybe those readers – 5,500 of whom clicked the like button on the Associated Media Coverage website – should have slowed down. In addition to removing the article, the website Associated Media Coverage appears to have rebranded itself. Its old URL now redirects to a page called The Seattle Tribune. It also adopted a marginally less-confident tagline: its old motto """"News You Can Trust"""" is now simply """"Informing the Nation."""" The Seattle Tribune describes itself as """"a news and entertainment satire web publication … Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."""" It has no association to the 126-year-old newspaper, The Seattle Times. PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to examine this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as """"not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life."""" The motorcycle claim – and its apparent intent to irritate motorcyclists – is the type of story that made up this fake news outlet’s bread and butter. The hoax-debunking website Snopes, which found the claim to be false, made this comment about the """"fake news"""" Associated Media Coverage article: """"The sensational claim was one of several hoaxes recently promulgated by the Associated Media Coverage fake news site, the most popular of which pertained to purported laws that would affect specific subsets of the population (such as motorcyclists or e-cigarette users),"""" Snopes wrote. If its goal was to rile up one of those subsets – and thereby drive clicks to the website – it worked on at least one motorcycling forum, DungBeetleBikers.com. A user called Prickle posted the verbatim article two days after it first appeared July 31, 2016. An Australian user called Roo promptly responded to the made-up spokesman’s reasoning that the speed limits would promote safety: """"Per capita exposure to road trauma on a motorcycle is always going to be much higher than say that of cage drivers,"""" Roo wrote, referring to non-biker motorists as """"cage drivers"""" and continuing indignantly, """"So, cages are exempt? That makes sense, dunnit?"""" It turns out speed limiters, or governors, are a real thing. You can buy them online for cars, motorcycles and ATVs, but the cost is usually a few hundred dollars, not the """"subsidized cost"""" of $35 as the article states. The article goes on to make a couple of other assertions that are easily disproved. The first tries to peg the number of annual motorcycle fatalities: """"... each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States."""" Actually, 4,693 motorcyclists died in the U.S. last year, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System.The peak years for motorcycle fatalities in 1980 and 2008 never topped 5,112. The second assertion is that 73 percent of motorcycle fatalities """"are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds."""" Wrong again. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that only 33 percent of all motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were speeding, according to an analysis by the Insurance Information Institute. In both cases, the figures cited in the article are nearly double the numbers put forth by authorities. When Snopes assessed this claim last August, it noted that Associated Media Coverage, unlike the Seattle Tribune, didn’t identify itself as """"fake news"""" or a satirical website. """"While many fake news sites include disclaimer notices informing readers that their content is not credible, Associated Media Coverage does not. As such, many of the less ostentatious claims (such as the 75 MPH motorcycle speed governor one) spread on social media amid a targeted audience,"""" Snopes wrote. Bottom line: The only thing bikers need to worry about if they go over 75 mph is a speeding ticket. Our ruling The website Associated Media Coverage claimed the federal Department of Transportation was forcing motorcycle owners to install speed governors on their motorcycles that would limit their max speeds to 75 mph. That assertion was never true and was sourced to a made-up federal government official. Supporting statistics that the phony spokesman cited also exaggerated the number of motorcycle fatalities each year and the propensity for speeding among people killed in those crashes. The website did not identify itself as a purveyor of fake news, and some motorcyclists took the bait. We rate the claim !""",1
"The story does not mention any cost information for Exelon (rivastigmine). The story does not quantify any benefits. What’s more, the story doesn’t give any idea what the benefits might be or what improvemements might be expected. See comments in “Evidence” section. The story reports the panel believes the drug to be “safe” but does not describe any side effects or harms of rivastigmine. These may include nausea/upset stomach, vomitting, loss of appetite, and headaches. The story does not describe any evidence for therapeutic claims that the drug works for treating Parkinson’s Disease. Additionally, it appears the FDA panel recommended approval of this drug for Parkinson’s based solely on studies from the manufacturer. Another issue is that while this drug might provide some improvement in dementia symptoms among some people with some forms of Alzheimer’s, those improvements may be small and not all people will show improvement. It’s not known whether long-term outcomes, such as nursing home admission, is improved with the drug. It’s not clear that this drug would have the same effects in a different population (those with Parkinson’s), and if so, whether those effects would be meaningful. There are no obvious elements of disease mongering. The story provides simple, straight-forward descriptions of both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, although more information might have been useful. The story does not provide any independent input about the therapeutic claims of rivastigmine for treating dementia in people with Parkinson’s. The story does not mention other treatment options, such as memantine. The story fails to mention a projected date for or the next steps in obtaining FDA approval. While the FDA usually follows the advice of the advisory panel, which in this case recommended the drug’s approval for treatment of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, the FDA does not have to follow the panel’s recommendation. There is no discussion of when the FDA might approve the drug for this indication. The story tells readers that the drug is currently on the market for treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. In other words, the story adequately reports the drug is not new, but is being considered for a new purpose. There is no obvious evidence the story relies on a press release.",1
"""When the House Judiciary Committee was considering legislation to tax and regulate marijuana, Kathleen Sullivan, Warren’s substance abuse coordinator, stepped forward to warn the committee about the dangers of marijuana use. """"We do know that the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years,"""" she told the committee during the April 29 hearing. When we contacted her for details, she emailed statistics collected from the states by the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Her data on admissions for substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, ranged from 1993 through 2011, a year shy of the 20 years she spoke of. According to those statistics, the rate of admissions in 1993 was 96 per 100,000 Rhode Islanders age 12 and older. In 2011, the rate was 166 admissions. But this wasn’t the highest that the rate has ever been over the past two decades. It peaked at 218 in 2009 and then declined in the next two years. The number of admissions, unadjusted for population, peaked that year as well, and then dropped. When we looked at the number of admissions that the federal agency reported online for 2012 and 2013, we found that the decline has continued, showing a drop each year since 2009. In her email, Sullivan qualified her statement saying: """"I was referring to the overall trend in marijuana admissions."""" So we took another look at the data and examined the trend in admission rates, even though she didn’t make this distinction in her testimony. The trend from beginning to end for admissions per 100,000 teens and adults has been up over the past two decades. But if you look at the trend line since 1999, there has been no statistically significant increase. We also contacted the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration directly and officials there told us there are limitations to the data that make Sullivan's position problematic. One major problem is that an individual can be counted more than once each year depending on how many times he or she has been admitted for treatment, explained Kelley Smith, a statistician with the administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. Smith said the data, known as the Treatment Episode Data Set or TEDS, do not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. """"Not according to TEDS,"""" Smith said in an email. """"According to TEDS, the percentages have remained relatively stable."""" Our ruling Kathleen Sullivan said the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, has reached its highest point in 20 years.

"In 2017, the conspiracy-peddling Neon Nettle junk news website published an article headlined “Harvard Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Pose No Risk.” The referenced “study” was, in fact, not a study but rather an “open letter” penned by a woman named Tetyana Obukhanych and published on the anti-vaccine website Thinking Moms’ Revolution — a site that promotes a $2,000.00 “ion detox” machine as a treatment for autism. Obukhanych’s letter, first published in 2015, continues to be shared and re-shared online despite its numerous shortcomings. We will discuss Obukhanych’s academic background toward the end of this post, as such details matter less than the content of the misleading or false claims made in her open letter, which we will address one-by-one. Broadly, Obukhanych argues that laws requiring mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren are misguided because most vaccines included in such laws (in her estimation) do not prevent the transmission of disease, and therefore an unvaccinated child would pose no added risk to a vaccinated child in a school setting: It is often stated that those who choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons of conscience endanger the rest of the public, and this is the rationale behind most of the legislation to end vaccine exemptions currently being considered by federal and state legislators country-wide. I have outlined … the recommended vaccines that cannot prevent transmission of disease either because they are not designed to prevent the transmission of infection … or because they are for non-communicable diseases. People who have not received [these vaccines] pose no higher threat to the general public than those who have, implying that discrimination against non-immunized children in a public school setting may not be warranted. Obukhanych’s repeated refrain is that accepting (or, more to the point, rejecting) these vaccines “cannot alter the safety of public spaces,” such as schools, because they afford only personal protection. The result is a viral story that provides a highly shareable but flawed justification to parents for use against other parents who accuse them of endangering their children by not vaccinating them. In most cases, Obukhanych’s reasoning is problematic and her conclusions unsupported by science. Tetanus, as stated in Obukhanych’s post, is a non-communicable disease. Vaccination against tetanus, which is caused by the release of a toxin produced by C. tetani bacteria, does not prevent the spread of those bacteria; it merely affords one’s body the ability to destroy the toxin they produce. That fact does mean a child without a tetanus vaccination poses no additional risk to others. It is worth mentioning, however, that 2 in 10 people who develop tetanus die from the disease, and that the tetanus vaccine (which is generally included in a three-vaccine combination) is uncontroversially safe for use in nearly all populations. Obukhanych attempts to make a similar argument against Hepatitis B vaccination, arguing that since it is a blood-borne disease, it is unlikely to be spread amongst children: Hepatitis B is a blood-borne virus. It does not spread in a community setting, especially among children who are unlikely to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as needle sharing or sex. Vaccinating children for hepatitis B cannot significantly alter the safety of public spaces. Obukhanych confidently asserts that Hepatitis B does not “spread in a community setting,” but while non-sexual and non-needle based transmissions are rare, they are not impossible, as the disease can be transferred from mother to infant or via cuts. Although the risk of a school-aged child’s contracting the disease is lower than an adult’s, the risk to the former of being chronically infected from the disease is significantly higher. Approximately 90% of infants and 25%–50% of children aged one to five years who are exposed to hepatitis B become chronically infected. For adults, around 95% recover completely from exposure to the same disease. On a population level, the hepatitis vaccine has been clearly successful in reducing the disease burden worldwide, thanks to high vaccination rates globally. While the impact of one child may seem negligible on a broad level, not vaccinating for hepatitis B very much impacts the “safety of public spaces.” Obukhanych’s argument against the Hib vaccine, which imparts immunity against Haemophilus influenzae type B bacteria (a common cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and epiglottitis, but, despite the name, is unrelated to influenza), attempts to make it sound as of the vaccine actively endangers the safety of public spaces. Her argument does so by ignoring entirely the fact that the Hib vaccine has been highly successful at reducing influenzae type B infections and focuses instead on the unproven assertion that several isolated influenzae type A or other “untypeable” strain outbreaks that have occurred since its introduction as a recommended vaccine were caused by vaccination. To make that case, Obukhanych cites a 2011 paper regarding the increasing incidence of H. influenzae type A diseases in adults in Utah. That paper was one of several which have documented increases in influenzae type-a (or other “untypeable”) infections in localized communities. That paper does not, however, make the argument that this increase (or other similar outbreaks) has a direct causal relationship with influenzae type b vaccinations (although that paper and others have speculated about it). The study explicitly stated that the cause remained unclear: “Several studies in addition to ours suggest an increase in invasive disease caused by to non-type b H. influenzae among adults. The reasons for this change are unclear, and might reflect changes in the organisms, changes in the number of persons at high risk, or perhaps waning of cross-immunity induced by exposure to Hib.” More recent research has still not provided complete answers to that question, but non-type-B outbreaks primarily affect older adult populations and have limited relevance to a schoolyard scenario. What is clear is that vaccination against type-B influenzae has greatly affected “the safety of public spaces.” Before the introduction of the Hib vaccine, about 20,000 children in the United States under 5 years old contracted Hib disease each year, and about 3%–6% of them died. Since the use of the Hib vaccine began, the number of cases of invasive Hib disease has decreased by more than 99%. Obukhanych’s argument against the diphtheria vaccine is that it is only good for personal protection. She makes this argument by correctly stating that diphtheria is caused by a strain of bacteria (Corynebacterium diphtheria) and by correctly stating that vaccination does not prevent transmission of those bacteria. This is an impressive bad-faith argument. Her argument conveniently leaves out the fact that the most dangerous infections associated with the disease are not caused by the bacteria themselves, but through the colonization of them by a virus (a bacteriophage called ß-corynebacteriophage) which induces the bacteria to produce a dangerous toxin. The diphtheria vaccine imparts immunity by preventing the bacteriophage from colonizing C. diphtheria, and this action does two things that directly “alter the safety of public spaces” in a positive way. First, one result of diphtheria vaccinations is that any C. diphtheria transmitted from one vaccinated human to another are not anywhere near as dangerous as the same bacteria transmitted by an unvaccinated person, since those bacteria not likely to be infected and therefore not likely to be producing the dangerous diphtheria toxoid. Uncolonized C. diphtheria can cause mild illnesses, but nothing close to as severe as true diphtheria. Second, uninfected C. diphtheria bacteria are less likely to be spread between individuals in the first place, meaning the vaccine quite literally reduces the chances that the disease will be transferred between individuals. In the 1900s in the United States, 76 people per every 100,000 died from diphtheria. Since the diphtheria vaccine’s introduction, fatalities from diphtheria have become nearly non-existent in the United States and other developed countries. Obukhanych’s argument against the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is similar to her attempted argument against diphtheria, which is that the vaccine does not prevent transmission of the disease, commonly known as whooping cough and caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis: An experiment with deliberate pertussis infection in primates revealed that the aP vaccine is not capable of preventing colonization and transmission of B. pertussis. The FDA has issued a warning regarding this crucial finding. That study was big news, as it provided a possible answer to the question of rising cases of whooping cough documented in the United States and other places around the world. The study provided evidence that the acellular pertussis vaccine, which replaced a “whole cell” version of the vaccine in many countries in the 1990s, does not prevent asymptomatic transmission of B. pertussis — cases in which the bacteria, but not the symptoms created by their infection, are transferred unknowingly between humans. Although the vaccine prevents the dangerous coughing that can sometimes prove fatal, Obukhanych is correct in stating that it may not prevent the bacteria’s transmission. However, Obukhanych’s characterization of the study as being evidence of harm for which the FDA had to issue a warning is misleading. The authors of that study made it explicitly clear that maintaining a high level of vaccination currently was of utmost importance because of the result: “It is important to note that our data in combination with human data show that vaccination with aP provides excellent protection from severe pertussis. Therefore, any short-term plan for addressing the resurgence of pertussis should include continued efforts to enhance aP immunization.” Responding to similar findings published in 2015, epidemiologist Benjamin M. Althouse told the New York Times that “until we get that vaccine, it is more important than ever to be vaccinated, and we need to keep the vaccination levels high.” Obukhanych’s argument against the polio vaccine is probably the most bad faith of them all. Her broad claim is that the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) does not prevent the spread of wild polio (the form of the disease that was in circulation worldwide before vaccination) and instead only works in countries such as the United States where polio eradication is complete. First, such a claim is patently false on its face. The inactivated polio vaccine is, for example, singularly responsible for the eradication of polio in most of the Scandinavian countries, which suggests that it has quite successfully blocked transmission of the disease. Her statement that “wild poliovirus eradication is attributed to the use of a different vaccine, OPV or oral poliovirus vaccine,” is broadly true for the United States, but not for the world as a whole. Second, Obukhanych misrepresents a study’s results to suggest that it provides evidence the IPV vaccine does not protect against the wild poliovirus. She does this to make the clever-sounding argument that a vaccinated child might pose a risk to unvaccinated children, but she does so by ignoring everything but a single sentence found in a single diagram in a lengthy New England Journal of Medicine study that sought to address the vaccine’s effectiveness against wild polioviruses. In her post, she references a footnote to a table showing the viral load of the feces of a control group of infants and a group treated with IPV after they were inoculated with OPV. Her interpretation of the figure is that “high counts of live virus were recovered from the stool of children in all groups, [making] it clear that IPV cannot be relied upon for the control of polioviruses.” In fact, the study’s authors viewed those results as evidence of IPVs success against wild poliovirus strains, which (not to put too fine a point on it) is the opposite of the argument she claims the paper is making (emphasis ours): In our study, the prevalence of excretion after receiving trivalent OPV was high (more than 90% for any poliovirus) and was similar among all three groups, including the control group, but viral titers were lower in both IPV groups, suggesting an effect of IPV vaccination on replication of polioviruses. These data from stool titers are consistent with a body of literature suggesting that previous vaccination with IPV can reduce the prevalence, duration, and titers of poliovirus in the stool. The World Health Organization’s view tracks that study’s view of IPV as well, stating that it “has been used successfully to eradicate polio in a few countries, notably in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, [and that in the] numerous countries that have been introduced to IPV over the last decade no evidence of continued circulation of poliovirus strains has been observed, indicating that IPV may successfully inhibit community transmission of poliovirus.” Obukhanych bills herself as a recovering “mainstream” academic who has seen the error of her field’s ways. She claims a PhD in Epidemiology from The Rockefeller University in New York and states on her Patreon page that she “held postdoctoral research training appointments in prominent immunology laboratories affiliated with Harvard Medical School and Stanford University School of Medicine.” Her publication record supports the notion that she held positions at, or worked with, these institutions, though she has few publications to her name. Despite not being a physician, she is a “Founding Director” of Physicians for Informed Consent (an organization described in multiple science-based medical blogs as a “radical anti-vaccine” group), and she has produced a self-published e-book titled Vaccine Illusion: How Vaccination Compromises Our Natural Immunity and What We Can Do To Regain Our Health.

"A $10 million lawsuit that was reportedly filed against Uber by a man accused of shooting eight people while working as a driver for the company in Kalamazoo, Michigan, has turned out to be a hoax, according to law enforcement officials. The handwritten, rambling letter was purported to be from Jason Dalton, who is awaiting trial on charges of killing six people on 20 February 2016 (between picking up fares as an Uber driver). Dalton, 45 — who faces 16 charges related to the shootings, including six counts of murder and two of attempted murder — told police that a “devil” in the Uber app took over his body, and that his memories of the shootings are spotty. The hoax lawsuit, which was mailed to U.S. District Court in Detroit and filed Tuesday, claims that Dalton had worked for Uber for years, although the company has said he was only approved in late January, less than a month before his shooting spree: This company is a hostile workplace environment. I am tired of being treated like a 2nd class citizen by Uber. Uber discriminates against my mental health. I’m currently in prison because of Uber…. I seek $10 million dollars in punitive damages and emotional distress. The letter also alleges that the company would call him late at night and tell him that if he didn’t go to work, he was fired. (Uber doesn’t set schedules for its drivers.) “He said he has no idea what it is,” Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Pali Matyas told local news outlets. “He said he didn’t send it, didn’t authorize it, doesn’t know who did.” In a previous e-mail statement, Matyas wrote: To let you know, the Dalton lawsuit was a hoax. I was suspicious last night when I saw the envelope the lawsuit came in was postmarked Philadelphia. We investigated and Dalton did not send it, did not authorize it and does not know who sent it. Further it was not his handwriting and it is not a jail envelope.",1
"""An assertion from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that vaccinations are about freedom and should be left to parental choice spawned a raft of reaction from the pundit and political world. One claim we heard a lot is Paul should know better. After all, he is an eye surgeon. In an interview on CNBC on Feb. 2, 2015, Paul hailed vaccines as a medical triumph but said he sees the controversy of whether it should be mandatory as an """"issue of freedom."""" Further, he said he heard of many """"tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."""" Dr. Celine Gounder, a physician who frequently appears on news channels to analyze health news, addressed his comments on CNN Newsroom the following day. """"Frankly, Rand Paul as an ophthalmologist should be out there saying measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide,"""" Gounder said. """"And as an eye doctor, he should be advocating for measles vaccination for that reason."""" Gounder’s claim, as it relates to Paul’s life as an eye surgeon, got our attention. And it’s correct. Gounder’s point is backed up by sources such as the World Health Organization and a host of academic studies and review papers that she sent us. ‘Worldwide’ is key Conjunctivitis, or pink eye, is a common side effect of a measles infection. """"Whoever you are, wherever you are,"""" people with measles can’t stand bright sunlight, said Dr. James Cherry, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. But for children in poor countries, eye damage from measles can be much worse. Blindness by measles in children is not common across North America and Europe, areas with high vaccination rates and access. The leading causes of blindness in those continents are lesions of the optic nerve, according to the WHO. In low-income countries, where access to vaccines that prevent measles is limited and malnutrition is prevalent, corneal scarring from measles and a deficiency of vitamin A are the major causes. In the United States, based on the most recent CDC data from more than 20 years ago, the leading complication (and complications from measles of any sort in the U.S. are not common) was diarrhea followed by middle ear inflammation and pneumonia. """"In the U.S., children could potentially develop eye problems during an episode of measles if they are malnourished,"""" said Dr. Richard Semba, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine ophthalmology professor. """"This would probably be rare."""" Vitamin A is important for eyes to function as they should, as well as for the body’s immune system and growth. If your teacher or mom didn’t tell you, the vitamin is found in eggs, whole milk, butter and liver, as well as leafy green vegetables and red, orange and yellow fruits. Measles is most common in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia and south Asia, together home to 85 percent of all blind children. In these places, measles is endemic, according to a 2004 review paper by Semba. That paper found measles blindness accounted for anywhere from 15,000 to 60,000 cases of child blindness per year. Here's how Semba explained blindness happening from contracting the highly contagious measles virus: The cornea, the front transparent layer of the eye, requires vitamin A to work. The retina, which is the back layer of the eye that receives visual images (like the film in a camera), requires vitamin A in order to allow us to see at night. A measles infection can reduce the levels of vitamin A that the body needs for normal health. As a result, during a measles episode, a child can develop ulcers in the cornea during a measles episode that makes it hard to see at night. The end result is """"a devastating loss of vision and blindness,"""" Semba said. Dryness in corneas can result in night blindness, corneal ulceration, scarring and resulting blindness, studies show. Countries with vaccination programs for measles have reduced the problem of widespread eye disease, according to WHO. The organization also recommends that children in developing countries who contract measles receive two doses of vitamin A supplements a day apart. """"Vitamin A supplements have been shown to reduce the number of deaths from measles by 50 percent,"""" WHO says. Paul’s spokesman sent us a link to a New York Times reporter’s account of watching Paul get his Hepatitis A booster shot Feb. 3, 2015, but did not answer our questions. Our ruling Gounder suggested Paul should be singing a different tune about vaccinations, one that mentions, """"Measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide."""" She was careful to say worldwide. In developed countries, measles does not typically lead to blindness. But in low-income countries, it is certainly one of the leading drivers of blindness in children, experts agree.""",0
"U.S. citizens Eric Betzig and William Moerner and Germany’s Stefan Hell won the prize for using fluorescence to take microscopes to a new level, making it possible to study things like the creation of synapses between brain cells in real time. “Due to their achievements the optical microscope can now peer into the nanoworld,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said as it awarded the 8 million crown ($1.1 million) prize. Scientists, who have been looking down microscopes since the 17th century, had long thought there was a limit to what could be seen. In 1873, Ernst Abbe stipulated that resolution could never be better than 0.2 micrometers, or around 500 times smaller than the width of a human hair. But the three Nobel winners bypassed this limit by tagging objects with fluorescent markers and scanning them to build up a far more detailed images. Today, such “nanoscopy” is used widely to visualize the internal molecular machinery of cells. “This is very, very important to understanding how the cell works and understanding what goes wrong if the cell is diseased,” Hell told a news conference by telephone after learning of the award. Modern nanoscale microscopes can follow protein interactions involved in diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cancer, or watch the transcription and translation of DNA to make proteins, or track the development of fertilized eggs as they divide and become embryos. The previous limit meant optical microscopes could see objects about the size of the smallest bacteria, but not the detailed workings of individual components inside cells. Light is a common theme of both this award and the Nobel Prize for Physics, which was given on Tuesday for advances in low-energy light-emitting diodes. “It’s no exaggeration to say that super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has revolutionized imaging, so this year’s Nobel Prize for Chemistry is very well deserved,” said Stefanie Reichelt, head of light microscopy at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge. Other techniques, such as electron microscopes, can provide greater resolution but require preparatory measures that kill cells, making them of no use for observing living processes. “If you want to see living things, you must use something which does not destroy the sample, by using normal light,” Anders Hagfeldt, a member of the Swedish academy and professor of physical chemistry at Uppsala University told Reuters. “It was said it could not be done, basically. Now, with these three laureates here, it is possible.”  Hell, who is director of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Germany, said he was “totally surprised” by the prize, while Betzig said he was stunned. “I have been walking around a daze for the last hour, on a nice day in Munich, fearful that my life has changed,” he told Reuters by phone from the southern German city, where he was scheduled to give a lecture on Wednesday. Moerner, who is attending a conference in Recife, Brazil, told Reuters TV: “I knew there was a chance but really had no idea... it’s something that makes your heart race.”   Betzig works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn, United States, while Moerner is professor at Stanford University. Chemistry was the third of this year’s Nobel prizes. The prize is named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and has been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace in accordance with his will. The chemistry prize has often lived in the shadow of physics and its star scientists such as Albert Einstein, though it was the field that was arguably closest to the heart of Nobel’s own work in developing explosives. As winners of the chemistry prize, the laureates enter an exclusive club of researchers such as nuclear pioneer Ernest Rutherford and Linus Pauling, the only person to win two Nobels on his own — for chemistry in 1954 and peace in 1962.",0
"On 21 March 2017, a viral post from a web site called Goodfullness.com (titled “If You See One of These Slugs Inside Your House, Dial 911 Immediately!”), argued that the invasion of the New Guinea Flatworm in Florida poses a acute risk to human health that necessitates calling 911. While this post (and many others like it) frames their invasion as a new event, it is not. This non-native species, also called Platydemus manokwari, was first spotted in August 2012 and confirmed by a team of researchers in 2015 in a scientific report that made significant news at the time: In the USA, the accidental introduction of P. manokwari through human agency to Florida is probably recent, with our first specimens found in August 2012. The species is apparently now well established, with several different locations found in 2014 in Miami Dade County. While viral posts implied that the discovery of a New Guinea Flatworm in one’s home necessitates a police response, authorities suggest otherwise. We reached out to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to ask if their department recommended reporting sightings of the New Guinea Flatworm to 911. They told us, via e-mail, that it is not necessary: The FWC is aware that New Guinea flatworms have spread to many parts of Florida, and people do not need to report sightings. Indeed, the primary danger of the New Guinea Flatworm is to the ecosystem rather than to human health. The pest has an infamous track record of damaging the ecosystems to which they have been introduced, as discussed in a 2014 study on their occurrence in France: Examined from an environmental perspective, P. manokwari has demonstrably had a serious negative impact on the biodiversity of native snail populations in the Pacific region […] and wherever it is deliberately or accidentally introduced it will continue to pose a threat not only to native molluscs, but possibly to other slow-moving soil invertebrates […] It may also indirectly have a negative impact on vertebrate species dependent upon these soil invertebrates. From a human health standpoint, the Goodfullness.com post makes a number of assertions about the risks P. manokwari presents to humans and other, larger creatures: These worms have the ability to consume rats and mice and when they dine on these animals, they pass on lungworm infections. From there, the infections are then transmitted to humans who are exposed to any air particles that have been contaminated by the rodent droppings. According to Florida International University professor of biology Timothy Collins, who actively studies their occurrence in Florida, the New Guinea Flatworm does not prey on rats, and typically eats “snails, earthworms, [and] slow-moving arthropods”. The New Guinea Flatworm is, however, a possible carrier of a parasite that passes through the feces of rats — the rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis). This parasite generally causes mild symptoms that generally resolve without treatment, but is capable of a more serious infection called eosinophilic meningitis, according to the CDC: Some infected people don’t have any symptoms — or have only mild symptoms that don’t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of meningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. The rat lungworm, as it turns out, utilizes a complex life cycle which requires three hosts, one of which can be a flatworm or snail, as described in a 2012 review of the parasite: When rats eat infected slugs or snails, they ingest third stage larvae which eventually grow to sexual maturity and reproduce in the heart. Single-celled eggs hatch in the lung, and first stage larvae migrate up the bronchial tree, are swallowed, and 6–8 weeks after infection are excreted with feces. Slugs or snails then eat rat feces and acquire the first stage larvae. Slugs and snails are obligatory intermediate hosts which support parasite development from the first to the third larval stage. If one’s food were to accidentally come in contact with the mucus of an infected flatworm, or if one were to directly consume the animal itself, you could potentially contract a rat lungworm infection, Collins told us via email: Angiostrongylus cantonensis, or rat lungworm, is carried by many animals, including Platydemus. For example, it has been reported in the Giant African Land Snail in Florida. There are published medical cases of people becoming infected with Angiostrongylus after eating lettuce over which snails infected with Angiostrongylyus have crawled. He tempered this analysis, however, with the caveat that there have yet to be any confirmed cases of the New Guinea Flatworm carrying the rat ringworm in Florida, and provided us with this simple advice: The average person can avoid risk by not handling the flatworms, or if they do, by not putting their hands near their eyes or nose before cleaning them carefully. In addition to the health risk, Platydemus have been reported by some brave soul to taste terrible, so eating them is a bad idea all around. This advice is in line with the CDC’s position as well: Don’t eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables. This invasive creature is a big problem for local ecosystems, and it is an issue that Collins and other scientists are actively researching. However, while there are indirect potential risks to humans from the New Guinea Flatworm in Florida, these risks in no way necessitate calling 911.",1
"""So you might have heard that U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta got himself into some trouble last week when he talked about rape. Gingrey, now in his sixth term in the House, said fellow Republican Todd Akin of Missouri was """"partly right"""" when Akin said last year that a woman’s body has a way of shutting down if she’s raped to prevent pregnancy. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to see whether there was any accuracy to Gingrey’s remarks. """"[I]n a situation of rape, a legitimate rape, a woman’s body has a way of shutting down so the pregnancy would not occur,"""" Gingrey said during a question-and-answer segment at a meeting Thursday of the Smyrna Area Council of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce. """"[Akin’s] partly right on that."""" Gingrey, an obstetrician/gynecologist who said he’s delivered more than 5,200 babies, explained some more. """"And I’ve delivered lots of babies, and I know about these things. It is true. We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble conceiving because of the woman not ovulating, ‘Just relax. Drink a glass of wine. And don’t be so tense and uptight because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate.’ So he was partially right, wasn’t he? But the fact that a woman may have already ovulated 12 hours before she is raped, you’re not going to prevent a pregnancy there by a woman’s body shutting anything down because the horse has already left the barn, so to speak. And yet the media took that and tore it apart."""" Akin later apologized for his remarks and said rape can lead to pregnancy. His initial comments were largely cited as the reason Akin lost his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who feared Akin’s comments would hurt him with women voters, gave Akin a verbal stiff arm. Gingrey said Akin’s remarks weren’t helpful. Gingrey’s effort to clarify what Akin said, first reported in The Marietta Daily Journal in its Friday editions, made the rounds within hours on several national political websites. The Democratic Party leader in Gingrey’s district has already announced plans to challenge the incumbent next year. On Monday, Gingrey’s Twitter site, deluged with criticism of Gingrey’s remarks, had been removed. Gingrey sent The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a statement Friday. """"I do not defend, nor do I stand by, the remarks made by Rep. Akin. … In my attempt to provide context as to what I presumed they meant, my position was misconstrued,"""" Gingrey said. Gingrey’s office did not respond to our messages for further comment. Some doctors and organizations said there is no accuracy to the Georgia congressman’s claims. """"While chronic severe stress and anxiety may impact fertility sometimes, the fact is that a woman cannot prevent ovulation or conception with their emotions, especially in an acute traumatic situation like rape,"""" said Barbara Croft, a board-certified OB/GYN based in Atlanta who has been in practice for 30 years. Croft called Gingrey’s comments patronizing, condescending and unscientific. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a Washington, D.C.-based organization with about 56,000 members, including Croft, echoed her comments. """"While chronic stress, for example from extreme exposure to famine or war, may decrease a woman’s ability to conceive, there is no scientific evidence that adrenaline, experienced in an acute stress situation, has an impact on ovulation,"""" the group told us via email. Gingrey is a fellow with the organization, which is defined as a board-certified OB/GYN whose professional activity is devoted to the practice of obstetrics and/or gynecology. For decades, some politicians and newsmakers -- mostly social conservatives -- have said women who are raped are less likely to become pregnant. Their definition of a legitimate rape is a woman who is sexually assaulted. The Washington Post reported that National Right to Life President John Wilke wrote an essay in 1999 that the """"physical trauma"""" of rape has a way of preventing pregnancy. The newspaper’s website has a link to the essay. The link contains an analysis of Akin’s remarks by the Rev. Robert Fleischmann, the national director of Christian Life Resources. """"Statistically speaking, it appears something happens in a rape, either with the victim or with the perpetrator, that reduces the incidence of pregnancy,"""" Fleischmann wrote in August. """"Fertility specialists continually debate the role of emotions, unresolved conflicts and trauma play in female infertility."""" There is some discussion on websites such as FertilityFactor.com that severe stress, eating disorders, excess exercise or extreme weight loss can interfere with regular menstruation. Some studies widely reported by news outlets conclude that the rate of rape-related pregnancy is higher than the rate of pregnancy from consensual sex. The likelihood of a rape-related pregnancy is usually in the 5 percent range, the studies show. Most of these studies, though, were done in the 1980s or 1990s. The Chicago Tribune, citing a Mayo Clinic publication about infertility, reported in August that mental stress can temporarily alter an area of the brain that controls the hormones that regulate a woman’s menstrual cycle. The Tribune article reported that it is a chronic kind of situation that occurs over months or years, not the acute trauma of a rape. Our conclusion:  Gingrey said it’s """"partly right"""" that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she's raped. There is some information that suggests that some conditions, particularly stress, can reduce fertility. But our research found it is not typically the stress of a rape. There’s scant scientific evidence to support Gingrey’s argument.""",1
"The release does mention costs twice, by saying that treating these cancers surgically is more costly, and that the use of the cream “can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas.”  But it doesn’t mention that the fluoroucil cream is fairly expensive. According to GoodRx, one 40g tube of 5% fluorouracil cream ranges from $73 to $136 a different pharmacy retailers. The cost may be considerably reduced by insurance plans, but the release does not address that either. Also of note, according to results in the published study, at least 11 patients must be treated with the cream in order to possibly prevent one additional cancer, leading to a drug cost of over $14,000 to prevent that one cancer. That may exceed the cost of surgery. The release clearly states:  “After the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC. There were six outcomes measured and only the difference in squamous cell carcinomas at one year was statistically significant while the other five were not. This suggests that the one statistically significant difference could have been caused by chance alone or that there truly is a difference but only in this one period of time. The release describes harms in the following paragraph: The cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study’s first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as “severe,” and 40 percent rated them as “moderate.” The release explains that half of the participants in the study received the 5 fluorouacil cream and the other half received a cream lacking that ingredient. It mentions the total number of patients in the trial (932) and notes that it was a multi-center trial that spanned several years. It gave real numbers of resulting cancers that led to the claimed 75 percent reduction and pointed out that while the cream was effective for squamous cell carcinomas, it had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of basal cell carcinomas. No indication of disease mongering here. However, the release missed an important opportunity to inform readers about the nature of these typically slow-growing cancers which rarely spread. There’s no context provided on what these cancers are or the burden they put on patients or the health care system. The release points out that the study was funded by the Veterans Administration but omits the fact that several members of the research team received support from pharmaceutical firms. However, there’s no indication that those connections played any role in the conclusions from the trial. The study mentions that surgery is the normal response to these skin cancers and that Mohs surgery is the procedure of choice in many cases. It also points out that “current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients — sunscreen or oral medications” — are available. The release notes that the cream, available as a generic, has been used to treat other conditions. That suggests the cream is widely available. The release quotes the study author claiming this was “the first study of its type. I’m hopeful there will be other studies that show other sorts of regimens that last longer and do a better job over time as science progresses. This is an important first step.” It also notes that further research is planned. The release does not rely on unjustifiable language.",0
"""Times are especially tough for new veterans, a state official said in a Dec. 5 news article in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. Ericka Walmsley, a Texas Veterans Commission employment representative, is quoted saying: """"When their term is up and they get out, there’s almost nothing for them now."""" One of three homeless men in the United States is a veteran, the newspaper quotes Walmsley saying. One in three? We asked Walmsley for background on that figure; she pointed us to a Web page kept by HelpUSA, a group that says its mission is to provide housing and the supportive services necessary for the homeless and people in need to become and remain self-reliant. The page has this statement: """"While the causes are many, the singular reality is staggering: 1 out of every 3 homeless men you see on the street is a veteran."""" At the commission’s Austin headquarters, spokesman Duncan McGhee pointed us to a chapter in a report posted online by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development stating: """"Among homeless men, 33 percent report being veterans, and a very high proportion (98 percent) of homeless veterans are men."""" Case closed? We weren’t sure, considering the posted chapter doesn’t indicate when or how that ratio was reached and the data appeared to have been collected in 1996. While seeking elaboration on the statistic from HUD, we ran the reported ratio by Neil Donovan, executive director of the Washington-based National Coalition for the Homeless, which describes itself as a national network of groups and individuals committed to ending homelessness. Donovan said the latest research indicates the share of homeless men who are veterans is not 1 in 3. HUD has completed an Annual Homeless Assessment Report since 2005; its latest rendition, issued in June 2010, says veterans accounted for 11 percent of the nation’s 1.2 million sheltered homeless adults in 2009 — or about 132,000 people — down from 13 percent in 2007. That percentage is derived from data collected on adults who used an emergency shelter or transitional housing program from October 2008 through September 2009. The report says too that a check of homeless, in shelters and not, on one night in January 2009 suggests that 13 percent were veterans, compared to 15 percent the three previous years. """"Many veterans confront the same issues that lead others into homelessness, such (as) lack of affordable housing and inadequate income and savings,"""" the report says. """"But they also have barriers that can be particularly acute among service-men and -women returning from active duty, such as the lingering effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse. These issues can make it difficult for veterans to find and maintain gainful employment, which in turn can make it difficult to pay for housing."""" Veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts """"have not yet become homeless in great numbers,"""" the report says, """"perhaps because it takes some years for the mental disabilities associated with war to become acute."""" A forthcoming companion report focused on homeless veterans will provide a baseline understanding of homelessness among veterans, the report says. Separately, an online search led us to a Dec. 7 speech by Eric Shinseki, the U.S. secretary of veterans affairs, in which Shinseki estimates the number of homeless veterans at 107,000 — down, he said, from 131,000 two years earlier and 250,000 a decade ago. In his posted remarks, Shinseki says that when he became secretary in January 2009, he taught himself to say, """"Veterans lead the nation in homelessness, depression, substance abuse, and suicides. And they rank right up there in joblessness as well. It was a punch in the gut for me, and I repeated that line until it sunk in. I didn’t want to become inured to its impact by letting it become part of the day-to-day background noise."""" Next, we heard from Brian Sullivan, a HUD public affairs officer, who said the 1-in-3 ratio is outdated; it comes from a 1999 report drawing on 1996 data that depended on a count of homeless men identified as veterans in 76 different communities, Sullivan said via e-mail. """"By today's data collection and reporting standards, it's not considered terribly relevant,"""" his e-mail said. In an interview, Sullivan said the 1999 study was based on a one-day snapshot of the homeless and a smaller sample size than more recent HUD assessments. The latest HUD tally draws on data from more than 3,000 communities, tabulating the homeless on a single day and also counting those using emergency shelters or transitional housing programs during the year. Sullivan suggested we check for updated counts with Dennis Culhane, a University of Pennsylvania professor who helped lead the latest HUD assessment. Culhane replied by e-mail that he’s comfortable with the 13 percent figure. """"I cannot vouch for the (1-in-3) estimate and am not sure it was ever correct,"""" Culhane wrote. When we queried Mary Cunningham, a researcher who specializes in homeless issues for the Washington-based Urban Institute, she said the 1-in-3 figure is outdated but added that all """"of these numbers should be treated as rough estimates. In general, it’s important to remember that there are far too many homeless who are veterans."""" McGhee of the Texas commission pointed us to a March 2010 report by Project CHALENG, a federal effort to enhance the continuum of care for homeless veterans. The report says that homeless veterans are under-counted, but there also are fewer veterans, period. """"In 1990, there were 27.5 million veterans, a total that has decreased to 23 million today. Similarly, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of poor veterans, decreasing from 3 million in 1990 to 1.8 million in 2000. Since most homeless veterans are poor, it is believed that there has been a corresponding drop in the number of homeless veterans as well... it does appear that a significant, long-term reduction in the numbers of homeless veterans has occurred,"""" the report says. We also reached Lawrence Cann of HelpUSA, whose Web page was the Texas commission employee’s source for the 1-in-3 figure. """"Given that many veterans do not report themselves as veterans or even seek services or shelters, we have not revised our 1-in-3 number,"""" Cann’s e-mail says, though in response to our inquiry he said the group would add Web links to other sources for homeless counts. When we looked at the HelpUSA site again, the 1-in-3 reference had been changed to 1-in-4. McGhee stood by the 1-in-3 ratio. To shore up his position with more recent data, he led us to the 2010 strategic plan adopted by the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which advises President Barack Obama and Congress on that issue. The plan terms the 107,000 count of homeless veterans nationwide (cited by Shinseki) """"a reasonable figure."""" Using U.S. Census Bureau statistics to extrapolate the percentage of males among veterans (93 percent), McGhee comes up with a figure of 99,720 homeless male veterans — slightly more than one-third of the total number of adult homeless people calculated from the January 2009 one-night survey. Bottom line: Experts outside Texas agree the claim that one-third of homeless men are veterans is based on obsolete data, though some cautioned that it’s hard to pinpoint how many homeless men are veterans and one sorting of the data appears to justify the claim. We rate the statement Barely True.""",1
"In August 2019, we received inquiries from readers about multiple claims that U.S. President Donald Trump had, in one day, called himself the “second coming of God,” the “King of Israel,” or “the chosen one.” On Aug. 21, the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats posted a meme that featured a quotation attributed to Trump: “I’m the King of Israel. I’m the chosen one” along with an unattributed quotation that read: “The Anti-christ will pretend that he is the son of God.” (That quotation is not Biblical in origin, and appears to have originated in a famous medieval text about the antichrist, written by the French Benedictine monk Adso of Montier-en-der.) The same Facebook page posted a second meme on similar themes, writing: Today, Trump: Promoted the idea that he is “King of Israel.” Retweeted that he’s “the second coming of God.” Then said he’s “the chosen one.”   And in a third post on the same subject, Occupy Democrats published a meme that read: “Trump says he’s ‘the second coming’ and ‘the chosen one.’ I say we throw him in the sea to see if he can walk on it.” Other mostly left-leaning sources posted similar claims on Twitter, garnering a high volume of retweets. One of them wrote: “When the president of the United States starts declaring that he is: – ‘The King of Israel’ – ‘The Chosen One’ – ‘The Second coming of God’ It means he is out of his goddamn mind & it’s time for the 25th amendment now.” When the president of the United States starts declaring that he is: — “The King of Israel” — “The Chosen One” — “The Second coming of God” It means he is out of his goddamn mind & it’s time for the #25thAmendmentNow. — Ryan Knight 🗽 (@ProudResister) August 21, 2019   The @BarristerSecret account tweeted that Trump had “unironically [declared] himself ‘the second coming of God,'” and the controversial surgeon and left-leaning activist Dr. Eugene Gu claimed the president had “[praised] himself as ‘the King of Israel’ and ‘the second coming of God. '”  Vanity Fair also published an article with the headline “Trump Declares Himself ‘King of Israel,’ ‘the Second Coming of God. '” The reality was much more complicated, and the claims and reports mentioned above largely misrepresented what Trump actually said or wrote by removing them from their proper context or issuing inaccurate descriptions of them. ‘The chosen one’ While speaking with reporters about the ongoing U.S. trade war with China, Trump did briefly say “I am the chosen one,” but it’s quite possible, even likely, that he was merely speaking tongue-in-cheek or for rhetorical effect. His remarks came on Aug. 21, while he was speaking with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. In response to a question about recent talk of an impending economic recession, linked to the U.S.-China trade war, Trump held forth on what he presented as sharp economic practices by China, a common topic of discussion for the president. He said: “One thing I have to do is economically take on China because China has been ripping us off for many years. President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama and others should have done this long before me. My life would be much easier — although I enjoy doing it — but my life would be much easier if I just said ‘let China continue to rip off the United States.’ It would be much easier, but I can’t do that … “… Somebody said ‘It’s Trump’s trade war’ — this isn’t my trade war, this is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago, by a lot of other presidents … Somebody had to do it. [Turning to the sky] I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it, so I’m taking on China. I’m taking on China on trade, and you know what? We’re winning …” President Trump: “I am the chosen one.” Full video here: https://t.co/BEh8qCGe79 pic.twitter.com/6pbll1a0NT — CSPAN (@cspan) August 21, 2019   The concept of a “chosen one” — an individual predestined by prophecy to perform the role of a savior or messiah for a particular people — has roots in various cultures and religious traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. However, it has evolved beyond those parameters to gain much looser and more secular connotations. It is a common trope in fiction and literature, especially science fiction and fantasy (think of Harry Potter), and is also frequently invoked, sometimes with tongue in cheek, in the context of sports. For example, the basketball player LeBron James famously had “Chosen 1” tattooed on his back, after Sports Illustrated published a cover story about him, describing the then-phenomenally promising high school junior as “the chosen one.” In theory, Trump could have been seriously declaring a sincere belief that he is destined by prophecy to be the savior of the American people, or indeed the world, when he said as an aside “I am the chosen one,” during a discussion with reporters about U.S.-China economic relations. However, it seems much more likely to us, especially in light of his somewhat theatrical glance to the skies, that he was either using the phrase as a figure of speech born out of his apparently rather certain belief in his own talents, or that he was simply speaking with tongue firmly in cheek, or a little bit of both. If the U.S. president refers to himself as “the chosen one” again, and with less ambiguous, more clearly messianic connotations, we will update this article accordingly. ‘The King of Israel’ and ‘the second coming of God’ Trump never declared or called or described himself as “the King of Israel” or “the second coming of God.” Further, he did not even quote someone who personally professed that belief, and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief. As such, many sources, including those mentioned above, grossly misrepresented the pronouncements made in this episode. However, in a decision that concerned many observers, the president did directly quote the conspiracy theorist and radio host Wayne Allyn Root as saying that “The Jewish people in Israel love [Trump] like he’s the King of Israel” and “like he is the second coming of God.” Trump did this in a series of tweets, also on Aug. 21, which he prefaced by writing “Thank you Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words”:  …. like he’s the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God … But American Jews don’t know him or like him. They don’t even know what they’re doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that’s OK, if he keeps doing what he’s doing, he’s good for ….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019   Trump almost entirely accurately quoted remarks Root made on his “Newsmax” TV show on Aug. 20. In response to a caller who lamented the purported irrationality and blind loyalty of Democrat voters, Root held forth on the traditional support for the Democrat party among Jewish voters in the U.S., in contrast with what he presented as widespread support for Trump among Jews in Israel. He said: “… 75 percent of all Jews vote Democrat and they don’t like Trump. And this is the greatest president for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America. Trump’s the best president for Israel in the history of the world. And the Jewish people love him like he is the king of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God. And in America, American Jews don’t like him. They don’t even know what they’re doing or saying any more, it makes no sense.” The remarks in question can be watched here (beginning at 36:45). Root was echoing similar statements Trump himself made earlier that day. Speaking to reporters at the White House, the president addressed the controversy over Israel’s reversed decision to bar U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from entering the country. Trump proclaimed: “Where has the Democratic party gone? Where have they gone where they’re defending these two people [Tlaib and Omar] over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.” Root’s original remarks came in the form of a simile, meaning it should have been clear by definition that he was not claiming that Trump actually is the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ, nor even that Jewish people in Israel believe he is those things. Rather, in order to emphasize what he perceives as the U.S. president’s popularity among Israeli Jews, Root was indulging in rhetorical license, using the device of a simile, by saying Israeli Jews loved Trump as if he were the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ. (It is a matter for a separate discussion that the second component of Root’s simile was woefully theologically illiterate. An important distinction between Christianity and Judaism is that Judaism traditionally rejects the notion of Christ as a messiah, thereby rendering the concept of a second coming inapplicable, and this part of Root’s simile nonsensical by definition.) Root later emphasized the fact that he was engaging in simile, rather than claiming Trump was, in fact, the king of Israel or the second coming of Christ, or even that Israeli Jews regard him as such. During a discussion with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly on Root’s “Newsmax” TV show, Root said: “… They [liberal opponents] took everything I said out of context … Did I really say, on national TV, on my ‘Newsmax’ show last night, that Donald Trump is the second coming of Christ, and he’s the king of the Jews? No. I said in Israel they treat him like he’s the second coming of Christ and the King of the Jews. And it’s a New York expression, you know, it’s like you and I could have been having an expression [sic] and I’d say, ‘Are you kidding me? In Israel they treat him like he’s the King of the Jews.’ Does that really mean that I believe he’s the King of the Jews? … Obviously, I didn’t say that.”  ﻿  We know that certain Christians in the United States and beyond have professed a fringe belief in Trump as a Christ-like or messianic figure. It’s even possible, theoretically, that Trump himself might harbor similar suspicions of his own destiny. But the series of statements he made on Aug. 21, 2019, did not constitute evidence of any such belief on his part. The president did say “I am the chosen one,” but he made the remark as an aside, combining it with a theatrical glance towards the heavens, while making a broader point about his engaging in a supposedly overdue trade war with China. The context, along with Trump’s penchant for flippant and tongue-in-cheek asides, makes it highly unlikely he was choosing that moment to earnestly articulate some sincere belief in his own messianic destiny. In a series of tweets, Trump quoted a controversial conspiracy theorist, Root, who had lavished praise upon the president, professing that Jewish people in Israel so admired Trump that it was as though he was the “King of Israel” or “the second coming of God.” But Root (as he later confirmed) was using exaggerated language as part of a simile. He was not making the factual claim that Israeli Jews literally believe that Trump is the King of Israel, or the second coming of Christ (the latter of which claims would make no sense for theological reasons, anyway.) So the widely promulgated claim that Trump, simply by quoting Root’s remarks, was in effect declaring himself to be the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ, was inaccurate by a considerable distance. Trump did not even quote someone who professed that belief, and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief.",1
"In a video that news media said had been uploaded to her Facebook page on Sunday, Valentina Maureira said from her hospital bed: “I am asking to speak urgently to the president because I am tired of living with this sickness and she can authorize the injection to put me to sleep forever.”  Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs. Maureira’s brother had died of the disease, her father, Freddy Maureira, told local Radio Bio Bio. “She has already had five operations ... which have caused her a lot of suffering and pain,” he said. “It was promised that things would get better, but for her it was worse.”   The video had surprised him, he added. A spokeswoman from the Universidad Catolica clinic in Santiago confirmed that Valentina Maureira was a patient at the hospital and said she was stable, with no immediately life-threatening conditions. Government spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said on Thursday that the health ministry was in contact with the family to ensure Maureira was receiving the psychological and medical treatment she needed, but ruled out euthanasia as an option. “We have to be completely clear, the current norm, the current law in Chile does not allow the government to agree to a request of this nature,” he said. In Chile, as in many countries, euthanasia is against the law. The Catholic Church retains a strong influence on society, and the country is one of a handful to ban abortion under any circumstances. Center-left Bachelet, who is a year into her second term, has introduced reforms, including a bill being debated in Congress that would relax the abortion law. These have angered conservatives. Bachelet’s agenda has not mentioned euthanasia.",0
"The story does mention that the scans are expensive – $1000 to $3500 and are not necessarily covered by insurance. The story could have provided costs of the traditional neurologic exam for comparison. The story does not attempt to quantify the benefits of PET scanning. The story states, “several studies suggest it can effectively provide an early warning”, but does not give any quantification for the magnitude of effects observed in these studies. Most importantly, the story does not mention that even if Alzheimer’s is detected early, there is not much that can be done for it. Aricept has only minor affects on the progression of the disease. Although the story hints at false alarms from the use of PET scans, this is insufficient information on the harms of scanning. What would a “false alarm” entail? What does it do to a person who receives this news? The story does not adequately describe the strengths of the available evidence. It says “Neurologists say PET is an excellent tool for distinguishing between Alzheimer’s and frontotemporal dementia.” But it then notes that “experts disagree over whether PET is useful for determining whether people with mild memory problems are suffering from early Alzheimer’s. Several studies suggest it can effectively provide an early warning. The catch is that there is insufficient research to determine exactly how accurate it is.” The story could have explained why there is such uncertainty; what is the nature of the studies that have been done? By accurately describing the prevalence of Alzheimer’s, the story avoids disease mongering. The story does quote two directors of major Alzheimer’s research centers. The story could have quoted other clinicians or researchers who may have provided some additional perspective. Although the story mentions neurologic exams, this is insufficient information on the alternatives. What are the advantages and disadvantages of PET scanning compared to existing approaches? How will the scanning fit in with current practice? These questions are not answered in the story. The story does not comment on the availability of PET scanners. The story does not comment on the novelty of PET scanning. How long have they been used for this purpose? We can’t be sure if the story relied on a press release. However, given that sources from several institutions were interviewed, it appears that independent reporting took place.",1
"Worldwide sales figure was mentioned, but no information on the cost of supplements was mentioned. Absolute benefit was presented. The story mentioned that the study found no serious side effects in six months. It also gave the caveat that the study did not address the issue of longer-term safety. This article reported on the results of a randomized clinical trial; details on its publication were included as well as potential conflicts of interest of the study’s authors. Other information sources were also mentioned in the piece. No obvious disease-mongering. Yet, although an estimate of prevalence was given, natural history of knee OA was not mentioned. Quoted one study author, the author of a companion editorial in the journal, as well as a rheumatologist not connected with the study. The story mentioned results from the use of Celebrex, a prescription NSAID medication, which was also included as part of the study. But the presentation of alternatives to the use of supplements was incomplete. Nonetheless, we give a satisfactory score. Mention made of loose regulation of supplements; use of the supplements is presented as common. The use of glucosamine and/or chondroitin for relief of knee osteoarthritis(OA) pain is not new and no suggestion of it being a novel approach was made. There is no evidence that the story relied solely or largely on a news release.",0
"The release mentions cost-effectiveness several times but does not give any indication of what the price of therapy with Entresto would be, nor the comparative cost between Entresto and other medications. Nor does it quantify what it means when it says the drug is “cost-effective.” The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, ICER, warned in a draft report that the drug’s current price was too high and that widespread use could overwhelm the health system. The drug cost was estimated at about $4,600 per year for a typical patient. According to the report: “At the list price of $4,560 per year, Entresto does not save money over the long term but its added costs are well-aligned with the degree of benefit it brings to patients, meaning that Entresto can be judged “cost-effective” in the long-term according to commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds.” “However, ICER’s analysis predicts that nearly 2 million patients could be prescribed Entresto over the first five years, creating a total budget impact so high that excessive cost burdens would be placed on the overall health care system. In order to keep health care cost growth in line with growth in the national economy, ICER’s value-based price benchmark for Entresto is $3,779 annually, a 17% discount off the list price. Private insurers and Medicaid programs are frequently able to achieve discounts at this level.” The published study did address cost in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). It would have been helpful for the release to add at least some costs which would add context. The release makes several statements about benefits to an entire population, not necessarily the benefits to an individual patient. The release provides a useful number-needed-to-treat explanation. “For every 1,000 patients treated with Entresto vs. enalapril, potentially 59.7 HF hospital admissions could be averted per each year alive in the model.3 In addition, Entresto increased life expectancy at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio consistent with other high-value widely accepted cardiovascular interventions such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cholesterol-lowering statins before they became generic.3″ One weakness in describing the benefits was the omission in the release (but not in the published study) of actual figures or percentages to back up the cost-effectiveness claim. The release includes extensive information on harms, including this summary of side effects: “Entresto may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema) that may cause trouble breathing and death.” The release provides some detail on the statistical model used and the analysis findings. Data was drawn from a previous trial to model health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the drug over a 30-year period. The release would have been stronger with a discussion of possible limitations of the analysis. Patients out in the real world tend to be older, sicker, and have other differences compared with those who participate in clinical trials, so it’s not clear that the benefits seen in the trial can be extrapolated to the broader population. In the study itself, the researchers mention several issues that could throw their findings off, but the release doesn’t address them. There is no disease mongering. The news release is coming from the manufacturer of the drug, Entresto, so the conflict of interest is clear. However, we would have liked it better if the release had identified, as the study did, that the principal author of the study receives grant support from Novartis, and several other authors are employees of Novartis. Entresto was compared to enalapril and found to be associated with — on average —  a year longer of survival as well as reduced hospital admissions. It’s noted that the drug is FDA approved. The release states that this analysis is not the first, but is novel because it quantifies “possible” impact in reducing death. “This analysis, based on an application of the results of PARADIGM-HF to published heart failure statistics, is the first to quantify the possible impact of Entresto’s potential benefit in reducing death.1″ There was no unjustifiable language.",0
"""Accusing your opponent of being soft on crime is pretty standard campaign fare, but Kentucky Democrat Jack Conway -- a candidate for U.S. Senate -- takes things one step further in a campaign video, using a two-year-old quote from Republican opponent Rand Paul to suggest Paul wants to decriminalize everything from drug dealing and burglary to prostitution. The ad begins with a clip of the Paul quote in question: """"The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law."""" It then cuts to an image of Bernie Madoff with the question, """"Should Wall Street Fraudster Bernie Madoff not be in jail?"""" A uniformed law enforcement officer then asks, """"What about meth and drug dealers?"""" Cut to another officer...""""theft, burglary...promoting prostitution...""""  And then back to Paul saying, """"The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law."""" Another version of the Conway ad follows the same theme. """"Thinks non-violent crime should be against the law? That's crazy,"""" one uniformed officer says. """"It should be a crime if you sells drugs to a minor,"""" says another cop. Then others...""""...Wall Street fraud. Mortgage fraud...burglary...someone that's promoting prostitution...theft."""" The implication is clear: Paul wants to legalize all non-violent crime, including drug dealing, theft, burglary and prostitution. On the campaign trail, Paul has repeatedly denounced the ad, and his campaign promptly put out a press release boasting that a number of county sheriffs had publicly declared their support for his campaign. """"I think it's a dishonest ad, would be the first thing I'd say,"""" Paul said in a Sept. 16, 2010, interview on Fox41 in Kentucky. """"What we were discussing a couple years ago on KET was whether or not things like motorcycle helmets and the lottery should be illegal because they’re immoral or because they're unsafe. And my point was that there are certain things adults can make decisions on. """"What that ad does is, he totally distorts it and wants to say I want to allow minors to use drugs, it is an absolute hood."""" Paul went even further in a Fox News interview on Sept. 19, 2010, calling the ad """"a lie."""" Paul again explained that he was a pundit panelist on a program called Kentucky Tonight on Nov. 24, 2008, and that the context of the discussion was not crime at all, but rather was """"about helmet laws for adults and whether adults should have the right to either gamble or buy lottery tickets. And the comparison between lottery tickets and gambling. And it really had nothing to do with drugs or drugs for minors, or all these things, prostitution...""""  """"So,"""" the interviewer interjected, """"you think those things should be illegal, Dr. Paul?"""" """"Yes,"""" Paul said. """"And I'm not proposing any changes in the drug laws or laws against prostitution."""" We listened to the entirety of the Kentucky Tonight program on the night in question, and Paul is correct that the focus was on whether the state ought to place higher taxes on things like cigarettes or alcohol. Paul made it clear he didn't think that was the government's place. """"Do we want our tax commissioner to be the moral commissioner of sin?"""" Paul said on the program. """"Where does it stop?"""" Paul said, throwing out the example of whether the government ought to put an extra $1 tax on a McDonald's quarter pounder to help curb obesity. """"It really isn't our job to tell people whether they should smoke or not,"""" Paul said. """"It's not our job to tell people whether they should eat too much or not. We're a free society where individuals can decide what they want to decide."""" In the course of the discussion, Paul talked about whether the government should regulate whether someone should be able to ride a bike or motorcycle without a helmet. And what about gambling? he asked, noting that, """"It's OK to gamble on the lottery, just not slot machines."""" """"I'm against legislating morality,"""" Paul said. """"I mean, I'm for crimes and having laws against things that are violent crimes. But things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law."""" So there's the fuller context. John Collins, a spokesman for the Conway campaign, said Paul's words speak for themselves. """"Rand Paul believes drugs aren't a pressing issue and that non-violent crimes, such as prostitution and selling drugs, shouldn’t be against the law,"""" Collins said. """"If Paul thinks that’s misleading, then he should not have said it. Simply put, you could hold a meeting of all the people who agree with Rand Paul’s soft on crime beliefs in a phone booth."""" We asked Collins for evidence to support the claim that Paul believes selling drugs, for example, shouldn't be against the law. He pointed us to a series of quotes in which Paul espouses the opinion that issues of crime are better addressed at the state and local, rather than federal, government level. So, for example, he has said that issues like whether to legalize medical marijuana ought to be decided by states, and that the funding for drug enforcement ought to come from state and local governments. Those may be controversial positions, but they are a far cry from Paul saying he believes that drug dealing and burglary ought not to be against the law. We asked Collins if he could point us toward any other quotes from Paul that suggest he doesn't think drug dealing, burglary and prostitution, for example, should not be against the law. He referred us only to Paul's two-year-old quote, """"The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law."""" Certainly Paul could have chosen his words more carefully. But this strikes us as more of a political """"gotcha"""" than a legitimate issue. The quote comes in the context of Paul discussing the propriety of government involvement in issues such as cigarette or alcohol taxes, gambling and wearing a motorcycle helmet. Paul said what he said. But for the Conway campaign to splice that with comments from law enforcement officials listing non-violent crime such as dealing drugs to kids, promoting prostitution, theft, burglary and financial crime suggests Paul wants to decriminalize those acts. We couldn't find a single instance where Paul has said he specifically wanted to legalize any of those activities. Conversely, Paul has repeatedly and unequivocally said he does not want to make those things legal, and that he has no plans to change the current laws with regard to them. We think a reasonable person can see what's going on here. We rate this ad .""",1
"""A Democratic lawmaker who disapproves of President Donald Trump recently suggested the 25th Amendment to the Constitution could provide a solution. """"POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger,"""" Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., tweeted on Aug. 15. """"Time to invoke the 25th Amendment."""" POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger. Time to invoke the 25th Amendment. But not all Democrats see the 25th amendment as an appropriate way of responding to Trump. Asked whether he thinks it should be used against Trump, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the amendment does not apply to present circumstances. """"I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office,"""" Schiff said Aug. 20 on CNN’s State of the Union. """"I think we're still far from concluding that that's the case, even though we find, many of us, his conduct anathema and there to be a serious problem here."""" For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Schiff’s reading of the amendment’s origins is right. We’re not going to weigh in on whether Trump’s actions or mental state fit the criteria for presidential disability. The 25th Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1967, sought to resolve several thorny issues of presidential and vice presidential power. It creates a succession plan for when these top two positions go vacant. It also allows the president to declare himself unable to fulfill his duties and transfer power to the vice president. However, we’re mostly interested in the 25th Amendment’s fourth and final section, which allows someone other than the president to make a finding of presidential disability. Section four authorizes the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet, or another body as determined by lawmakers, to declare a president """"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."""" Doing so would then elevate the vice president to the position of acting president. The president can restore his powers by declaring that no inability exists. However, the same body that initially transferred power to the vice president can respond by essentially doubling down on their declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties. Then, if Congress, by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate, agrees that the president is unable to serve, the vice president continues to act as president. Such a move could permanently strip a president of his powers — hence, why some legal analysts refer to section four as the """"involuntary removal mechanism."""" The push for Congress to formalize a blueprint for handling presidential disability gained traction after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963 (though lawmakers had first considered it much earlier in American history). """"The assassination of President Kennedy ... produced a flurry of additional proposals dealing with the subject,"""" John D. Feerick wrote in a 1995 article in the Wake Forest Law Review. """"These proposals were influenced by the sense at that time that, if Kennedy had lived, the country would have had to deal with the problem of presidential inability in a most tragic setting."""" As congressional hearings unfolded, little controversy surrounded the amendment’s first three sections, according to Feerick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real debate centered on when someone other than the president could declare him or her to be incapacitated. The amendment’s principal author, Sen. Birch Bayh, D.-Ind., embraced an understanding that presidential inability would encompass both physical and mental inability, said Joel Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University, who’s closely studied the congressional record. The formulation he adopted was put forth by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who said presidential inability """"involves physical or mental inability to make or communicate his decision regarding his capacity and physical or mental inability to exercise the powers and duties of his office."""" Another important architect of the amendment, Rep. Richard Poff, R-Va., held a similar view, according to Goldstein. Poff said section four not only applied when the president, due to accident or illness, was unconscious or otherwise unable to make or communicate a decision, but also when """"the President, by reason of mental debility, is unable or unwilling to make any rational decision, including particularly the decision to stand aside."""" On July 6, 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and the necessary 38 states ratified it Feb. 10, 1967. Legal experts told us the drafters used intentionally vague and open-ended language (i.e., a president who is """"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."""") because they recognized they couldn't predict every scenario in which a president could be deemed disabled. But despite the definition’s fuzziness, Goldstein said """"the record makes clear that section four was not intended as a means of removing the president simply because he or she makes an unpopular decision."""" So did Schiff’s claim that the authors intended to cover physical incapacitation, serious mental illness and a general an inability to function, hit the mark? """"I think he’s right, as far as a one-sentence summary could have it,"""" said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University. """"They made the process and the terms flexible, but that was what they were mainly thinking of."""" Schiff said, """"I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office."""" The framers used deliberately broad language to allow for flexibility. But the record clearly shows they intended section four of the 25th Amendment to apply when a president is """"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"""" due to either physical or mental inability, and not principally as a strategy for ousting an unpopular president. We rate Schiff’s statement .""",0
"Nearly 3 million people are struggling with flooding, the worst in two years, according to the disaster management and relief ministry. As water levels began to recede, authorities expressed concern about outbreaks of infectious diseases in the country of more than 160 million. “With the receding flood waters across the country, there is a possibility of outbreaks of water-borne diseases,” Shah Kamal, secretary of the disaster management and relief ministry, told Reuters by phone from Sirajganj, a flood-hit district 130 km (81 miles) from the capital Dhaka. “That’s why we are setting up water treatment plants in the flood-affected areas on a priority basis,” he said. At least 22 patients with symptoms of diarrhoea and some other ailments were admitted to hospital in the northern Bogra district, said surgeon Gowsul Azam. Raqibul Alam, spokesman of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in Bangladesh, said about 700 volunteers, including 100 staff, were engaged in relief operations in the northern and northwestern parts of Bangladesh. The Red Cross is providing food, drinking water and other aid, including 4,500 taka ($54) per family to help flood victims, Alam said. Kamal said the government had earmarked 45.80 million taka ($543,684) to help people rebuild houses. Two officials from the agriculture department said early estimates suggested farmers had lost agricultural produce worth more than $40 million. “The losses will be substantially higher when we get a full list from different flood-affected areas,” said one official. About 9 km of embankments, 172 km of roads and nearly 250 bridges and culverts had been damaged by the floods, according to a preliminary assessment by the disaster management and relief ministry. In neighboring Nepal, torrential rain caused landslides that swept away five houses on Tuesday, killing eight people in Gulmi district in the west, police said.

"In the aftermath of a deadly mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October 2017, conspiracy theorists latched on to an entirely unrelated tragedy in upstate New York, falsely claiming a link between a murder-suicide perpetrated in Fairport, New York, and the actions of the Las Vegas shooter: A key witness in the Las Vegas shooting massacre has killed himself and his disabled daughter in a horrific murder-suicide shortly after the FBI raided his home. John Beilman was wanted for questioning by federal agents in connection with a communications device discovered in suspected shooter Stephen Paddock’s hotel room. Articles explicating this conspiracy theory contained many details and factual claims that were not supported by any real evidence, and even cited evidence that, in reality, comprehensively disproved any “link” between the deaths of John Beilman and his daughter and the Las Vegas shooting massacre. Here is what we know to be true: On 4 October 2017, police in the town of Fairport, New York (about 10 miles from Rochester) confirmed that 60-year-old John Beilman had shot and killed his 27-year-old daughter Nicole before shooting and killing himself. Beilman left a note for his wife, but the motive behind the shooting is not known. Police confirmed that Nicole Beilman was diagnosed with Rett Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can severely impair an individuals ability to speak, walk, eat and breathe. Two days later, the Rochester newspaper Democrat and Chronicle, citing anonymous sources, reported that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had searched the Beilman home on 3 October 2017, the day before the shooting. That article does not provide any specifics as to the reason for the purported search. Claims that Beilman’s actions have anything to do with the Las Vegas massacre rest on the following “evidence”: This claim is inaccurate, and was known to be inaccurate at the time both articles were written. On 6 October 2017, NBC News reported that investigators, after earlier being puzzled by the presence of the phone charger, “have now been able to match all of the cell phone chargers found in the room with multiple cell phones that Paddock had with him.” Without providing any evidence, both articles claim that S.V.R. (Russian intelligence) sources had identified the device as charging a “CP502520 3.0V 600mAh Li-MnO2 Non-rechargeable Thin Cell Battery.” Setting aside the fact that there is no evidence to support this claim, we know it to be impossible. The battery specified is non-rechargeable — there is no charger that is compatible with it, so the charger found in the Las Vegas shooter’s hotel room cannot be associated with it. The entire conspiracy theory falls down around this point alone, but let’s briefly address some of its other components. Even if the charger could work with the type of battery specified (it cannot) we know that this battery is used “in both professional & consumer applications,” according to its manufacturer, Ultralife Corporation. There is nothing particularly notable about its use, or the use of the (imaginary) charger associated with it. Some of the common applications listed include: smart security cards, bank theft tracking systems, and medical devices. None of these are exclusive to U.S. special forces or the CIA. This appears to be accurate. Beilman’s public LinkedIn profile lists him as an employee of Ultralife from 2007 to 2012 and mentions that he performed “electromechanical assembly” of lithium ion batteries, chargers, and other devices. Whereas conspiracy theorists posited that Beilman “worked on various top-secret communications systems for the US military,” there is no evidence to support this claim. Given that police have paired the charger found in Stephen Paddock’s hotel room with one of his phones, and the battery at the center of this conspiracy theory cannot be charged anyway, John Beilman’s work history is, of course, irrelevant. There was no evidence to support these claims. It appears that the creators of this theory started with the fact of John Beilman and his daughter’s death, and worked backwards, via his professional history, in an effort to find some way of connecting him with the Las Vegas shooting. There is no valid connection, and the evidence offered actually refutes the entire theory. In fact, this tale was yet another fabrication that originated with the conspiracy-mongering WhatDoesItMean fake news site, which RationalWiki describes as follows: “Sorcha Faal” is the alleged author of an ongoing series of “reports” published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don’t think much of it. There is a high chance that “Sorcha Faal” is actually David Booth, the owner/operator of the website, or someone collaborating with him. The primary audience of Sorcha Faal’s reports and the only ones who take them seriously are usually other conspiracy theorists. Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. “American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears”[8]) and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don’t contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. Cited sources range from the mainstream media and Wikipedia to Infowars and Richard Hoagland. The author also has the habit of adding unnecessary links to the websites of the various Russian institutions they mention. Nonetheless, the WhatDoesItMean.com fabrication gained enough currency online that the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle felt a need to debunk it as well: If you get your local news from the Democrat and Chronicle or television news stations in town, there’s a lot you haven’t heard about the Fairport man who killed himself and his daughter. Namely that the man, John Beilman, was a “key witness” in the Las Vegas mass shooting and was “wanted by federal agents” in connection to the massacre. It isn’t true, but it’s been widely circulated online via social media courtesy of bogus news websites and their readers, most of whom are unschooled in news literacy and unable to parse fact from fiction. The Beilman-Las Vegas connection appears to have originated on a website called WhatDoesItMean.com in a report dated Oct. 7 under the bizarre byline of “Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers.” Faal is a suspected pseudonym of the website’s owner. Shoddy and fictitious sourcing, half-truths and bewildering leaps of logic are trademarks of her reporting. None of this has stopped her story from being circulated by websites known to publish schlock and sensational disinformation for the purpose of profiting through clickbait. Two such sites are Neon Nettle and USSA News, which bills itself as “The Tea Party’s Front Page.” From there, the story has been spread like wildfire on social media by unsophisticated news illiterates whose reality is so muddied they can’t tell truth from fiction anymore. It’s sad and dangerous and undermining our institutions. Is it coincidence that Beilman committed the murder-suicide within hours of the FBI search of his home? We don’t know for sure, but probably not. It’s very likely that the search motivated Beilman to act. What federal agents were looking for at Beilman’s house hasn’t been reported because the search warrant affidavit, which was signed by a judge authorizing the search, is under seal. The 1 October mass shooting in Las Vegas has prompted a slew of conspiracy theories and hoaxes, many focused on the involvement of “second shooter.” During a press briefing on the day after the massacre, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo directly rejected such theories:",1
"""There was no discussion of costs, but most people know what coffee and tea costs. Because the story noted the limitations of an observational study like this, and because it quantified the statistical associations from the study, we give it a satisfactory score on this criterion. There was no discussion of the potential harms of drinking large quantities of coffee and tea. There are always tradeoffs. This is worth at least a line. The story did mention that the information presented was extracted from a review of the published studies; it went on to explain that a clinical trial would be needed to determine whether the impact of these beverages on diabetes was real. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. In contrast with the WebMD story, it provided a source when it stated, """"Type 2 diabetes, which is often tied to obesity, affects about 8 percent of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases."""" No independent sources were quoted in the story. We especially feel that this was warranted given the inclusion of the researcher’s bold claims of potential impact  of the findings. While the last line of the story mentioned exercise and diet, there was no context for readers to evaluate how coffee and tea consumption compared to these strategies for reducing the chance of developing type II diabetes. The availabilty of coffee and tea is not in question. The story began by explaining that this was a follow-up to a previous literature review of the impact of coffee and tea consumption on type II diabetes. There is no evidence that the story relied solely or largely on a news release.""",0
"""On the May 12, 2011, edition of the Fox News Channel's’ O’Reilly Factor, host Bill O’Reilly and conservative commentator Laura Ingraham discussed a speech on health care given earlier that day by possible Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney’s speech was designed to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts health care plan passed when he was governor and the national health care law signed in 2010. In a separate item, we analyzed whether Romney was justified in calling the national law a """"government takeover."""" Here, we’ll look at a comment Ingraham made regarding in-state public opinion about the Massachusetts plan. """"Look, I like Mitt Romney,"""" Ingraham said. """"I think he's a really smart guy, and I think he would be a good president. ... On this, I don't get it, though, Bill. I mean, costs have gone up. It's wildly unpopular."""" We wondered whether the Massachusetts system was in fact """"wildly unpopular"""" with Bay State residents. We found two polls that shed light on this question to one degree or another. One was conducted in early April 2011 by Suffolk University of 500 Massachusetts residents. In response to the question, """"Do you think health care in Massachusetts is working?"""" the poll found that 38 percent said yes, 49 percent said no, and 13 percent were undecided. This would seem to provide a measure of support for Ingraham’s claim. However, the question was phrased more broadly than Ingraham’s claim because it referred to """"health care in Masschusetts,"""" which could include factors well beyond the state health plan, such as their own personal experiences with the specific doctors, hospitals and pharmacists they use. And even if the results were a direct commentary on support for the Massachusetts system, a split of 38 percent in favor and 49 percent against doesn’t indicate the state health care law is """"wildly unpopular,"""" as Ingraham said. Unpopular, perhaps, but not necessarily """"wildly"""" so. A more appropriate yardstick for measuring the plan’s popularity is a survey taken by the Harvard School of Public Health with the Boston Globe in mid September 2009. Here are two questions that most directly address Ingraham’s claim. Both were asked of the 467 respondents who told the pollsters that they were aware of the law:  Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law? Support: 59 percent Oppose: 28 percent Don’t Know: 13 percent  Do you think the Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform Law should be repealed, continued as the law currently stands, or continued but with some changes made? Repealed: 11 percent Continued as the law currently stands: 22 percent Continued but with some changes made: 57 percent Don’t know: 10 percent  The first question found residents support the law by more than a two-to-one margin. The second demonstrated that residents were not entirely satisfied with all of the law’s provisions, but it did show that support for outright repeal was low -- only 11 percent. A major caveat to the Harvard poll is that it was taken a year and a half ago, and sentiment may have changed since then. (Support for the law did drop by about 10 points compared to a 2008 Harvard poll.) Still, the Harvard data, despite being older, directly addresses Ingraham’s claim and indicates she was wrong. """"The statement about the plan being ‘wildly unpopular’ is unfounded given available polling data,"""" said Robert Blendon, the Harvard researcher who helped do the poll. As for the newer poll, David Paleologos, who directed the poll in question, said the question has value, while acknowledging that it is broader in focus. """"It’s a snapshot of how people feel currently about Massachusetts health care,"""" he said. """"I think that’s all we can garner from the question. … Unless questions are identically worded, a lot of the comparison is left open to one’s opinion."""" On the advice of experts, we decided not to consider a recent customer satisfaction survey commissioned by the government agency that runs the state health insurance exchange created under the law. That study found that 84 percent of participants in the Commonwealth Care program rated it 4 or 5 on a five-point satisfaction scale, while only 4 percent said they were dissatisfied. Some news accounts mistakenly reported that this was a poll of all Massachusetts residents, but it wasn't, so we don't believe that it's a valid yardstick for assessing Ingraham's comment. We should note that an estimated 400,000 Massachusetts residents -- or only about 6 percent of people living in the state -- have secured health coverage as a direct result of the law, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. That has enabled 98.1 percent of Massachusetts residents to secure insurance -- the highest rate of any state. But that also means that the impact of the law has been indirect for more than 9 of 10 Massachusetts residents. Residents need to include a certificate of insurance when they file their taxes. More important, but less tangibly, they may find their insurance costs or their taxes going up due to how the law has reshaped the insurance market. And there is evidence that the increase in number of insured residents in the state has put pressure on primary care physicians, potentially leading to longer waits for service. Still, one Massachusetts political analyst, Tufts University political scientist Jeffrey Berry, said he didn’t detect a groundswell of opposition to the law among residents. """"Massachusetts voters, like voters everywhere, are unhappy with rising health care costs,"""" Berry said. """"They see that in their insurance premiums -- every paycheck and every year, the rates go up. The reform for the uninsured passed during the Romney administration is, itself, largely invisible. People know it's there but don't know how it's working (or, unless they're on it, don't know how it works). There's very little press coverage of the program. In Massachusetts there is simply no controversy about the plan at this point. Most telling is that there is no real organized opposition to it and no effort in the state legislature to revise it."""" Berry concludes that Ingraham’s """"wildly unpopular"""" claim is """"wildly exaggerated."""" Additional data from the Harvard poll supports Berry’s sense that it’s actually apathy -- rather than opposition -- that’s shaping views of the Massachusetts plan. The pollsters asked, """"Generally speaking, do you think this health insurance law is helping, hurting, or not having much of an impact on the quality of your health care, the cost of your health care and your ability to pay medical bills if you were to get sick."""" Here are the results:  • On quality, 23 percent said the law was """"helping,"""" 14 percent said """"hurting,"""" and 55 percent said it was """"not having much of an impact."""" • On cost, 19 percent said it was helping, 24 percent said it was hurting and 47 percent said it wasn’t having much impact. • And on people’s ability to pay their medical bills, 24 percent said it was helping, 14 percent said it was hurting and 53 percent said it wasn’t making much difference. In other words, for each of these three issues, either a majority or a plurality of respondents said the law wasn’t having a significant impact. So where does this leave us? The Harvard data contradicts Ingraham’s argument, showing a fair amount of support for the law in general alongside feelings that it’s not doing much for them personally. The Suffolk poll is more recent, but the question asked is too broad to speak directly to Ingraham’s claim. And we couldn't find any other support for Ingraham's claim.""",1
"A man holds a cigarette in Tokyo August 3, 2009. REUTERS/Stringer Researchers, whose findings appeared in the American Journal of Medicine, said that there are still plenty of questions, including exactly how effective alternative therapies might be and how they measure up against conventional methods to quit smoking. But the alternatives should still stand as options for smokers determined to break the habit, said researchers led by Mehdi Tahiri of McGill University in Montreal, Canada. In general, smokers who want to quit should first try the standard approaches, which include nicotine-replacement therapy, medications and behavioral counseling, Tahiri said. “But some people are not interested in medication,” he said, adding that in many cases the standard therapies had not worked. “Then I think we should definitely recommend (acupuncture and hypnosis) as choices.”   Researchers found that some studies showed that smokers subjected to acupuncture were more than three times as likely to be tobacco-free six months to a year later. Similarly, across four trials of hypnosis, smokers had a higher success rate with the therapy compared to people who had minimal help. But there were some caveats, researchers said. The success rate was not consistent in all the tests conducted, although the broad trends pointed to the benefits of alternate treatment. A 2008 study that ran a few sessions of laser acupuncture on 258 smokers found that 55 percent who’d received the treatment quit the habit in six months, compared with four percent who were not given the treatment. But a 2007 study from Taiwan that looked at needle acupuncture around the ear, the area typically targeted for smoking cessation, reported a lower success rate. Only nine percent of those who were given acupuncture had quit after six months compared with six percent who stopped smoking without the treatment. The situation was similar across the hypnosis trials. Two studies showed a significant impact : 20 to 45 percent of hypnosis patients were smoke-free six months to a year later. The other two trials showed smaller effects. Nonetheless, Tahiri said, there was a “trend” toward a benefit across all of the studies of acupuncture and hypnosis. There are still definitely questions, he added, about how many sessions of acupuncture or hypnosis might be necessary, or which specific techniques are best. Other research reviews, though, have concluded that the jury is still out on alternative therapies for quitting smoking. SOURCE: bit.ly/Khhv63",0
"Augmented reality game Pokémon Go was an instant hit after it was released in summer 2016. The fad led to rumor after rumor, including the potential for a Hogwarts-themed version of the game dubbed “Harry Potter Go.” What began as speculative memes and petitions developed into solid rumors that Niantic immediately decided to build upon its success by releasing a Harry Potter variant. Before long, the buzz transcended social media to reach news media, with reports that Harry Potter Go was set for a 2017 release. Some articles simply speculated, but outlets like Hello Giggles and NME reported in July 2016 that “Harry Potter Go” was definitely, well, a go: The creators of Pokémon Go are developing a Harry Potter version of the game. Niantic have announced that they will be making Harry Potter Go following the success of their Pokémon game. Since over 15 million users worldwide have downloaded Pokémon Go, fans of the J.K. Rowling books and films have been petitioning Warner Bros to create a Harry Potter game. Hello Giggles reports that Niantic’s senior developer Marcus Figueroa said the company had decided to create the game as “the demand for this title was absolutely insane, so we figured we’d give it a shot.” The story seems to have first appeared on JTXHNews, which referenced an apparently nonexistent interview with gaming outlet IGN: Niantic’s senior developer Marcus Figueroa announced the new project in an interview with IGN We have acquired the rights for the app. The demand for this title was absolutely insane, so we figured we’d give it a shot. If we’re lucky we might see a launch by early 2017, but it’s hard to tell this early in the project. When pressed for details, Figueroa had this to say We want to do something with schools of witchcraft and wizardry, similar to pokestops in Pokemon GO. As wells a quest system, and possibly large scale completely interactive events, but no promises. That’s all I can say. JTHXNews appears visually identical to hoax purveyors that spread viral fabrications claiming that celebrities are moving to (or experiencing flat tires in) small towns across Canada and the United States. On the same day NME reported that Harry Potter Go was in development, Gizmodo pointed out that no record of a “Marcus Figeroa” at Niantic exists, and no such announcement appeared anywhere other than a fake news outlet. Niantic made no such announcement in July or August 2016, and did not indicate that any plans for “Harry Potter Go” were in even the earliest planning stages. However, that doesn’t rule out a Harry Potter Go game eventually appearing, as Pokémon Go was first conceived as an April Fool’s Day hoax in 2014. On 8 November 2017, the “hoax” became reality when Niantic announced that it would be releasing a Pokémon Go-type augmented reality game for Harry Potter enthusiasts. The game will be called “Harry Potter: Wizards Unite”: We’re incredibly excited to announce this next step in the evolution of AR mobile entertainment. With Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, players that have been dreaming of becoming real life Wizards will finally get the chance to experience J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World. Players will learn spells, explore their real world neighborhoods and cities to discover & fight legendary beasts and team up with others to take down powerful enemies. We’re thrilled to partner with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and WB Games San Francisco’s development team to bring this magical and beloved series to life in a brand new way. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will leverage the full stack of the Niantic Platform while also providing an opportunity to pioneer all new technology and gameplay mechanics.",0
"Cost is not a major issue in this story. The story states that the caloric restriction group saw a 20 percent average improvement in memory performance. The report also describes the size of the group tested and the duration of the study. It would have been useful to know how memory was tested in order to appreciate what a 20 percent improvement means in practical terms. 20% of what? 20% that makes what kind of difference in daily functioning? Maddeningly, the story does not report how many calories the restriction group ate on a given day. The story mentions that some earlier studies found that caloric restriction was linked to memory decline. But it fails to mention one very important practical warning relevant to the study populations: That older patients are at increased risk for malnutrition, and should not restrict their caloric intake without medical superivision. Further, it’s not known whether caloric restriction is safe for slightly overweight or normal weight adults regardless of age. The article properly describes the basic limitations of the evidence: that the study is small and the results less than conclusive. But the report fails to mention two important caveats: That caloric intake was based on participants’ self-reports, a notoriously undependable way to determine diet compliance. That the data don’t rule out whether the improved memory may be linked to weight loss rather than caloric restriction. Finally, there’s one intriguing potential explanation that might have been explored: whether the cognitive improvements might be related to performing a new mental task daily for three months: Counting calories and logging food intake. On balance, the story receives an unsatisfactory rating under this criterion. The story does not exaggerate the severity or incidence of memory loss in older adults. The reporter interviewed one of the study researchers, a lead researcher in a related study and one independent expert. Other tactics have been shown to boost older adults’ memories, including aerobic exercise and some social and behavioral activities. But in this story, which focuses on a key finding about dietary restriction, it is not necessary to mention these options. The availability of caloric restriction is not in question. The story does a good job of briefly sketching out the history of caloric restriction testing in animals and people, making clear that caloric restriction is not novel. The story turned to several sources and did not appear to rely solely or largely on a news release.",0
"Maraschino cherries have long been familiar to Americans as those bright red, sweet cherries typically used to adorn cocktails, ice cream sundaes, and other drinks and confections. On 9 February 2015, a blog post titled “Maraschino cherries classified as decorations, not food; contain toxic, banned dye” stated that an atypical progression of regulatory classification in the U.S. led to the unusual circumstance of maraschino cherries being deemed purely decorative (rather than food) items and regulated as if they were not meant for human consumption, allowing them to continue to be manufactured with a dye that has since been banned for use in consumable products:  FD&C Red #4, also known as Scarlet GN, was banned as a food additive in 1960. Today it is banned in Europe; in the United States it is allowed only in externally applied drugs and cosmetics. It is not allowed in products that are applied near the eye. Despite this, Red #4 is added to Maraschino cherries. This has been happening because the US government considers the cherries decorations, not food. In the 1920’s, during the prohibition of alcohol in the United States, companies began soaking the cherries in a brine solution rather than alcohol. Chemicals and coloring, including Red #4, were added until 1960, when it was banned because it was not considered “suitable and safe” by the newly empowered FDA. In 1965, it was again allowed to be added to the cherries because they were re-classified as decorations. Keep in mind that not all Maraschino cherries are made with Red #4. Some contain Red #40 which contains benzidene, a human and animal cancer causing agent. It is broadly true the federal standards defining maraschino cherries shifted in the post-Prohibition era. In 1912 the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) specifically defined “maraschino cherries” as “marasca cherries preserved in maraschino” (a form of liqueur) and required similar products made with other types of cherries and/or liqueurs be labeled as “imitation maraschino cherries.”  By 1940, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had revised that definition to pertain to any red-dyed cherries “impregnated with sugar and flavored with oil of bitter almonds”:  Food Inspection Decision 141, issued in 1912 under the Food and Drugs Act of 1906, stated that “maraschino cherries” should be applied only to marasca cherries preserved in maraschino. This decision further described maraschino as a liqueur or cordial prepared by process of fermentation and distillation from the marasca cherry, a small variety of the European wild cherry indigenous to the Dalmatian Mountains. Products prepared from cherries of the Royal Anne type, artificially colored and flavored and put up in flavored sugar sirup might be labeled “Imitation Maraschino Cherries” or, if there was no reference to “Maraschino,” might be labeled to show that they are preserved cherries, artificially colored and flavored. Later, evidence submitted at the hearing held in April 1939 for the purpose of establishing a standard of identity for canned cherries and evidence submitted by a committee representing a trade association showed that the term “Maraschino Cherries” had come to mean to the consumer cherries which have been dyed red, impregnated with sugar and flavored with oil of bitter almonds or a similar flavor. As a result, TC-194, March 15, 1940, was issued in which it was stated that the Food and Drug Administration had reached the conclusion that “Maraschino Cherries” is the common or usual name of cherries prepared in this manner. Although it might seem intuitive this change was necessitated because the Prohibition-era ban on alcohol sales made the original form of maraschino cherries an illegal product, manufacturers were “using all sorts of things other than alcohol” to make maraschino cherries long before Prohibition was enacted in 1920 (which is why the USDA had taken the step of defining exactly what they were back in 1912), and the FDA didn’t redefine them as a non-alcoholic product until 1940, seven years after the end of Prohibition. It is also true after the FDA initially banned the use of Red No. 4. as a color additive in food, they allowed its continued use in maraschino cherries beginning in the mid-1960s. However, the FDA banned that coloring again in 1976 (along with Red No. 2, which was also commonly used as a coloring for maraschino cherries), and Red No. 4. may now be used only in “externally applied drugs and cosmetics.”  There is no exception allowing its use in maraschino cherries. The FDA requires the ingredients labels on containers of maraschino cherries must include “a declaration of the presence of the artificial coloring”:  Labels for “Maraschino Cherries” must bear a listing of ingredients, including those in the packing medium, in descending order of predominance in accord with section 403(i)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and a declaration of the presence of the artificial coloring, artificial flavoring, and any chemical preservative as required by section 403(k) of the Act. As can be seen from those labels, nearly all maraschino cherries sold in the U.S. are now manufactured with Red No. 40 (also known as Allura red), a coloring additive that is FDA-approved for use in “food, drugs and cosmetics:  Red No. 40 is approved as a food colorant in both the U.S. and the European Union (EU), although a few EU member nations (Denmark, Belgium, France, and Switzerland) have banned its use. Some confusion may stem from the fact that natural Red No. 4 (also known as carmine or cochineal) is still widely used in the U.S. as a coloring additive in food products (potentially including maraschino cherries), but the original Red No. 4 and natural Red No. 4 are chemically two very different substances. The latter is FDA-approved “for use in human food” (and, somewhat controversially, is made from the crushed carcasses of a particular South and Central American insect). So just which red food dyes are unquestionably safe? As Joan Callahan summed up the issue in 50 Health Scares that Fizzled:  At present, we regret to report that no available red food coloring seems entirely safe by any universally accepted criteria. Some of these dyes are potential carcinogens, if consumed at unrealistically huge doses. Others are made from squashed insects that not only sound icky, but may cause hyperactivity or allergic reactions in children. Some religions forbid consumption of anything that contains insects; others frown on the sacrifice of living animals as food. Are the products bad, or is the state of knowledge bad? One argument in favor of the latter is the fact that different countries allow the use of different red dyes. In other words, everybody seems to be interpreting the same data differently.",1
"You needn’t be an expert in psychology to pinpoint January as one of the least enjoyable months of the year: the excitement of the holidays has concluded while related bills begin rolling in, the coming of a new year is for many people a reminder of passing time that prompts sad reflections about missed opportunities and accomplishments, no extended breaks from school or work are in the offing, and in many parts of the northern hemisphere the weather is unpleasant if not downright dangerous. It’s often cold and drab out, with summer a distant memory nearly half a year away. But is any date on the calendar in January statistically the most depressing day of the year? Social media users have frequently posted about “Blue Monday,” a term assigned to any number of specific days in January (typically the third monday of the month). Rumors abound that a particular date (typically a Monday) has been deemed by scientists or researchers to be the most depressing of the entire year, with a number of factors influencing the calculation of this bummer of a date. Going by popular lore, you might believe we scarcely can control our level of contentment on that day given all the mathematical reasons for us to be well and truly miserable. The concept of a “Blue Monday” took root in 2005. In that year, a press release detailed a purported formula that calculated factors including weather, debt, time elapsed since Christmas, and unsuccessful New Year’s resolutions. When those factors were combined and the “sadness” algorithm applied to them, 24 January 2005 was identified as the single most depressing of the year. Almost immediately the claim was regarded by many as a shaky one because the cited factors were clearly vague and nearly impossible to quantify, and because of the dubious impetus behind the “formula.” The calculations were attributed to a Dr. Cliff Arnall of the University of Cardiff in Wales, who explained:  “Following the initial thrill of New Year’s celebrations and changing over a new leaf, reality starts to sink in,” Arnall said. “The realization coincides with the dark clouds rolling in and the obligation to pay off Christmas credit card bills.” The formula was devised to help a travel company “analyze when people book holidays and holiday trends,” said Alex Kennedy, spokesperson for Porter Novelli, a London-based PR agency. It seems that people are most likely to buy a ticket to paradise when they feel like hell. “People feel bleak when they have nothing planned, but once they book a holiday they have a goal, they work toward having time off and a relaxing period,” Kennedy said. If that sounded a bit like a paid placement by a public relations firm working on behalf of a travel company to increase vacation sales, it’s because the “research” was exactly that. By 2006, Blue Monday’s roots in public relations had been fully exposed via others working in scientific fields who’d been offered the same financial opportunity as Arnall (who was a part-time tutor for night students at the time):  In fact it’s not surprising that these equations are so stupid, because they come from the PR companies almost fully-formed and ready to have your name attached to them. I know that because I have received an avalanche of insider stories — Watergate it isn’t — including one from an academic in psychology who was offered money by Porter Novelli PR agency to put his name to the very same Sky Travel equation story that Arnall sold his to. In amongst their aggressive pitch they described how the story would go. “Blue Monday — January Blues Day is Officially Announced: The 26th of January is the most depressing day in the calendar for the majority of Brits as measured by a simple mathematical formula developed on behalf of Sky Travel. “By taking into account various factors such as avg temperature (C), days since last pay (P), days until next bank holiday (B), avg hours of daylight (D) and number of nights in during mth (N), we create a formula such as C(P+B) N+D. This formula allows us to work out the day with the highest ‘depression factor’ which you can then use as a focus for making things better, booking your holiday etc …” This is almost exactly as it was when Arnall revealed his important work to the world. Arnall later followed up with a corresponding “happiest day of the year” formula, sponsored by the Wall’s ice cream company. In the intervening years, journalists and mental health professionals have taken Arnall to task for minimizing the issue of clinical depression. He later commented on his involvement with PR-as-science, amusingly objecting to other people’s fabricating information to promote a claim:  Despite criticism of his decision to accept money from PR firms, he insisted he had no regrets; in the past five years, he has earned a total £1,650 for identifying the two dates. “There was one comment that I had bought a really big house out of the proceeds,” he said. “People just make this stuff up.” He added: “I was originally asked to come up with what I thought was the best day to book a summer holiday but when I started thinking about the motives for booking a holiday, reflecting on what thousands had told me during stress management or happiness workshops, there were these factors that pointed to the third Monday in January as being particularly depressing … but it is not particularly helpful to put that out there and say ‘there you are’ … it is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy that it is the most depressing day.”  While the initial Blue Monday PR campaign has long since concluded, the belief any one day in January is particularly or significantly the most depressing took on a life of its own. Not surprisingly, the claim has been repeatedly recycled by other companies seeking to promote goods or services in the post-holiday  winter period. And as social media became increasingly influential, the rumor evolved from a formula based on circumstances to an analysis of words used in tweets:  Blue Monday was originally identified in 2005 by academic Cliff Arnall, who thought it fell on the last full week of January. He calculated the date using a variety of factors including weather conditions, debt levels, failed New Year’s resolutions and the number of days that had elapsed since the end of the Christmas holidays. But over the past three years, researchers analysed more than 2 million tweets posted by Britons in January looking for negative language and phrases indicating a drop in mood. They found that today, there will be nearly five times the average number of tweets relating to guilt, as people abandon their promises to pursue a healthier lifestyle. In 2014, the Blue Monday story was reincarnated and harnessed by “researchers” linked with (among other interests) an alcohol company, law firms, and a bottled water brand.",1
"In January 2017, a truck carrying a load of red Skittles spilled thousands of the sweet candies on the side of a Wisconsin road. While the sight stirred up some interest on the internet, social media users were flummoxed when they discovered the intended destination of the candy: a cattle farm. The Skittles were confirmed to have fallen off the back of a truck. The truck was a flatbed pickup and the Skittles were in a large box. Due to it raining at the time, the box got wet and gave way allowing the Skittles to spill out on the roadway. It is reported that the Skittles were intended to be feed for cattle as they did not make the cut for packaging at the company. In the end these Skittles are actually for the Birds! While many were shocked to learn that farmers had intended to feed the Skittles to cows, this practice has been going on for several years. In 2012, CNN reported that several farmers had started feeding their cattle candy due to a corn shortage: Feeding candy to cows has become a more popular practice in tandem with the rising price of corn, which has doubled since 2009, fueled by government-subsidized demand for ethanol and this year’s drought.Thrifty and resourceful farmers are tapping into the obscure market for cast-off food ingredients. Cut-rate byproducts of dubious value for human consumption seem to make fine fodder for cows. While corn goes for about $315 a ton, ice-cream sprinkles can be had for as little as $160 a ton. “As the price of corn has climbed, farmers either sold off their pigs and cattle, or they found alternative feeds,” said Mike Yoder, a dairy farmer in Middlebury, Ind. He feeds his 400 cows bits of candy, hot chocolate mix, crumbled cookies, breakfast cereal, trail mix, dried cranberries, orange peelings and ice cream sprinkles, which are blended into more traditional forms of feed, like hay. The farmer said that he goes over the feed menu every couple of weeks with a livestock nutritionist who advised him to cap the candy at 3% of a cow’s diet. He said that the sugar in ice cream sprinkles seems to increase milk production by three pounds per cow per day. John Waller, a professor of animal nutrition at the University of Tennessee, told Live Science that farmers have been using candy to pad out cow feed for years: “I think it’s a viable [diet],” Waller said. “It keeps fat material from going out in the landfill, and it’s a good way to get nutrients in these cattle. The alternative would be to put [the candy] in a landfill somewhere.” According to Waller, padding out cow feed with waste candy is nothing new. He says he first heard of Tennessee cattle raisers using candy years back, and that throughout the country, whether it’s orange rinds in Florida or almond hulls in California, beef producers are serving the hard-to-get-rid-of byproducts of local food industry to their herds. “Ruminant animals are very good at utilizing a wide variety of feedstuffs, because the microbes in the rumen can digest things that other animals can’t utilize,” he said. While it’s true that farmers feed candy to their cattle, cows are not being fed troughs filled with nothing but Skittles. The candies are mixed in with other materials to create animal feed:",0
"Meryl Streep gave director Roman Polanski a standing ovation after he won Academy Award for Best director for “The Pianist” in 2003. Meryl Streep’s standing ovation of Roman Polanski was dredged up after she delivered a speech at the Golden Globes that took aim at Donald Trump (without naming him directly):  At tonight's #GoldenGlobes we honor Hollywood legend Meryl Streep with the prestigious Cecil B. Demille Award. pic.twitter.com/dxpeCDNXY6 — Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017  Twitchy, a “social media curation site,” posted an article about Meryl Streep’s standing ovation of Roman Polanski, who fled to Poland to avoid child sexual assault charges in 1978, and surmised, “there’s a reason conservatives hate Hollywood.” The post includes a clip of Harrison Ford announcing Roman Polanski, who was not present at the awards ceremony, as the winner of the Academy Award for Best Director. Then, at the 1:10 mark, Streep and other A-list celebrities give Polanski a standing ovation, as can be seen in this screen grab:  ‘”I’m sure he’s a nice man and I know he has a family and I think he deserves closure and to be allowed to put this behind him. He said he did it, he pled guilty, he went to jail. I don’t know what people want from him.” In 2009, after Roman Polanski was arrested amid another failed extradition attempt, Streep told an Italian reporter, “I’m very sorry he’s in jail.” That quote has also been circulated in the wake of Streep’s comments about Trump to argue that she’s hypocritical.",0
"""One of the best ways to show voters the impact of tax cuts is to break them down in a way people can appreciate. Take Gov. Rick Scott's budget roll-out the week of Feb. 7, 2011. Scott says his spending plan includes $4.1 billion in tax and fee relief over two years. That sounds good, but it means little to someone unfamiliar with the inner workings of the state budget. So Scott's budget team decided to boil that figure down to show the impact on Florida households. In a graphic showing the proposed tax relief for 2011-2013, Scott's budget gurus added this simple-to-digest sound bite: """"Total Savings Per Household, $540 Over Two Years."""" The figure got repeated by various media outlets. So we wondered, is it right? No doubt about it, Scott's budget proposal includes a variety of tax and fee reductions. Among them:  • Reduce the corporate income tax from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2011-2012 and from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012-2013. The rate cut will save those who pay the tax $459 million this year and a little more than $1 billion in 2012-2013. • Reduce the required local effort, a property tax to fund schools, saving taxpayers around $600 million in 2011-2012. The tax cut would carry forward in 2012-2013. • Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts 25 percent for two years, saving taxpayers $180 million annually. • Reduce unemployment compensation taxes by shortening how long Floridians can collect benefits and making it more difficult for them to be eligible. Scott's office says that will save $630.8 million over two years. • Roll back 2009 Legislature-approved fee increases for driver licenses, vehicle registrations and other motor vehicle fees. Scott says the rollback would save drivers $492 million over two years. • Repeal or alter other small taxes on ammonia, pesticides, fertilizer, solvents, dry cleaning, tires and lead acid batteries, among other things. The changes would save $77 million over two years, Scott's office says. Taken together, Scott's says the savings for taxpayers is $4.1 billion over two years. (For the record, we question that overall figure because most cuts in the second year of Scott's budget aren't additional cuts; they are just the same cuts rolled over.) But what's critical in determining a per-household savings is remembering just who will get the tax breaks. And, who won't. Two of the three biggest tax cuts -- the reduction of the corporate income tax and the changes to the unemployment compensation tax -- apply only to corporations. So unless your household is like Rick Scott's and you own a corporation, you'll see no direct savings under Scott's plans. Supporters of the cuts argue that the benefits could trickle down to average Floridians through additional jobs or cheaper prices for goods and services. But there's no guarantee either will happen. The cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax make up $2.1 billion of Scott's overall $4.1 billion impact. In comments to the Senate Budget Committee on Feb. 9, 2011, Scott budget chief Jerry McDaniel said Scott's top tax priority was to remove taxes that he says inhibit job creation. McDaniel said Scott particularly wanted to reduce and eventually eliminate the state's corporate income tax. We asked McDaniel after the  Feb. 9 meeting if he knew whether the per-household figure accounted for the corporate tax cuts. McDaniel said he did not know and suggested we e-mail the governor's press office seeking clarification. We did, but did not hear back. So we did the math ourselves. According to the U.S. Census, Florida had 6,337,929 households in 2000 (the last year that precise data is available). However, the state's Demographic Estimating Conference meets annually to project the number of Florida households, among other things. At their most recent meeting on Oct. 25, 2010, the group estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Florida would have roughly 7.5 million households. The group's estimates are based on the active number of residential electric customers and residential building permits. Using the most recent household estimate, it's easy to see the error in Scott's tax cut math. Not counting the cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax, the average household would see in the neighborhood of $267 in tax savings over two years, not $540. ($2 billion / 7.5 million = $267 per household). That's an annual savings of around $134, or less than half of what Scott suggested. The $540-per-household figure Scott used to sell his budget plan is intended to appeal to voters who would relish a hefty tax cut, even over two years. But he failed to factor in that more than half of those tax cuts would apply only to employers, not regular Floridians. In calculating the savings, it appears clear that Scott and his office simply divided the entire tax cut as projected by Scott -- $4.1 billion -- by the entire number of Florida households -- 7.5 million -- to reach their average savings of $540. That's easy math. But it's deceptive. We rate this claim Barely True.""",1
"The story does not touch on costs. Mixed bag here. The story does some of this, giving readers a “quantifier” example about how many of 10,000 women might forgo heart attacks due to taking estrogen, based on the study’s findings. But sadly, they don’t give a similar quantifier for the perhaps exaggerated headline: “Estrogen lowers breast cancer risk.”  The same type of absolute risk calculation shows that the margin of benefit, if it exists, would be small: 8 fewer cases per 10,000 women per year. There may be a statistically significant difference, but it is small. Because of this omission, we judge this one unsatisfactory. Kudos to the The Times for parsing risk carefully. Among these: estrogen alone carries different risks than estrogen-with-progestin, estrogen-alone for older women is much riskier than for younger women and risks for women who still have a uterus (unlike those who have had a hysterectomy) are also different. Last, but still important, the form of estrogen used in the study is not typically used now, so conclusions about benefits cannot be assumed to follow to the current form (estradiol.) Good job by the Times at digging below the surface and explaining nuance to readers. The critics, who published an editorial in the same JAMA issue point out that the WHI finding of decreased breast cancer risk with estrogen runs counter to results of many other studies showing an increased risk. The story does a good job of discussing a variety of risks without exaggerating any of them. If anything, they may exaggerate the benefits in the headline. The story benefits from direct interviews with sources holding different perspectives. The story delivered important information on how not all hormone replacement therapy is the same. For example: “A major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman’s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women’s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.” and ” Dr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a “good choice.” “When you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good — it’s been all or nothing. This calls attention to the fact that there are differences,” said Dr. Chlebowski. “I hope that separation will become clearer now.” “When you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good — it’s been all or nothing. This calls attention to the fact that there are differences,” said Dr. Chlebowski. “I hope that separation will become clearer now.”  Estrogen is widely available and story does not need to talk about that. The story doesn’t make any inappropriate claims about estrogen, and it does appropriately try to frame the novelty of the research – “a finding that challenges the conventional wisdom about the risks of some hormones used in menopause.” The story includes independent reporting, so it’s clear it didn’t rely on a news release.",0
"""Newt Gingrich, on the campaign trail before the Florida GOP primary, called out the Barack Obama administration for engaging in a """"war against religion."""" Federal officials' interpretation of the 2010 health care law violates religious freedom, he said. """"Their decision last week that they would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance is a direct violation of freedom of religion, an example of the dictatorial attitude of this administration,"""" he told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 30, 2012. What decision was he talking about? One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops of a Jan. 20 decision that """"ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans,"""" according to the group. The bishops said """"almost every employer and insurer."""" We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration """"would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance""""? 'The Obamacare standard'  The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care. We should mention: There's not a clear """"Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance."""" The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover """"essential health benefits."""" They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states. The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-pays kept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmental Institute of Medicine recommended that preventive services include """"all FDA-approved forms of contraception."""" So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services. Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptions  Notice we said that """"most"""" health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said """"almost every employer and insurer."""" Gingrich said, """"every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution."""" But the rule provides an exemption for """"certain non-profit religious employers"""" that meet a four-part test -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. It's that definition of """"religious employer"""" that has prompted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups. That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ella can be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA. The government is giving such nonprofit religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them. The decision already faces legal challenges from Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University. Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a """"Catholic institution,"""" or a synagogue to be a """"Jewish institution,"""" Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services. Our ruling Gingrich said that """"the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance."""" He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket """"Obamacare standard"""" for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans. Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court.""",1
"Using genomic sequencing techniques, researchers at Britain’s Wellcome Sanger Institute and France’s Institut Pasteur also said they should now be better able to estimate the risk of future cholera outbreaks in regions like Yemen, giving health authorities more time to intervene. “Knowing how cholera moves globally gives us the opportunity to better prepare for future outbreaks,” said Nick Thomson, a professor at Sanger and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who co-led the work. Nearly four years of war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthi group have crippled healthcare and sanitation systems in Yemen, where some 1.2 million suspected cholera cases have been reported since 2017, with 2,515 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in October that the outbreak is accelerating again with roughly 10,000 suspected cases now reported per week, double the average rate for the first eight months of 2018. To explore the origins of the outbreak, Sanger and Pasteur team sequenced the genomes of cholera bacteria samples collected in Yemen and nearby areas. They included samples from a Yemeni refugee center on the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border and 74 other cholera samples from South Asia, the Middle East and eastern and central Africa. The team, whose findings were published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, then compared these sequences to a global collection of more than 1,000 cholera samples and found that the strain causing the Yemen epidemic is related to one first seen in 2012 in South Asia that has spread globally. However, the Yemeni strain did not arrive directly from South Asia, the scientists found, but was circulating and causing outbreaks in eastern Africa in 2013-14, prior to appearing in Yemen in 2016. “Genomics enabled us to discover that the strain of cholera behind the devastating and ongoing epidemic in Yemen is likely linked to the migration of people from eastern Africa into Yemen,” said Thomson. He added, however, that from the samples available, the team was not able to pinpoint exactly which countries in eastern Africa the strain had come from.",0
"Splenda is the trademarked brand name of a sucralose-based artificial sweetener which is several hundred times sweeter than ordinary table sugar (sucrose). According to legend, the discovery of sucralose was (like that of another artificial sweetener, aspartame) something of an accident that occurred by happenstance during the course of unrelated research:  The oddest manner in which a new sweetener came to light was when, one day in 1976, a foreign research student at King’s College in London misheard the instructions of his supervisor, Professor L. Hough. Hough was searching for possible synthetic industrial applications of sucrose, the common sugar of cane and beet, and several derivatives had been produced in the laboratory. One of these was a trichlorosucrose (sucrose into which three atoms of chlorine had been introduced). Hough asked Shashikant Phadnis to ‘test’ the substance, but, his ear being imperfectly attuned to the language, Phadnis instead tasted it. Sucralose, as it became known, is one of the sweetest of all substances and can replace sucrose at less than one-thousandth of the concentration. After gaining approval by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Canada (and other countries) in the 1990s, sucralose-based Splenda overtook aspartame-based Equal and NutraSweet and saccharin-based Sweet’N Low as the leading brand in the U.S. artificial sweetener market. The advantages of sucralose over regular sugar are many: it is so sweet that it can be used in much smaller quantities than sugar, it contains no calories, it has no harmful effect on teeth, it can be safely consumed by diabetics, and it is heat-stable and therefore suitable for use in baked goods. In the years since then, sucralose has (like aspartame before it) become the target of false claims that it is “unnatural” and therefore unsafe:  Before you reach for a packet of Splenda (sucralose), think twice. Don’t be fooled by its slogan “Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar.” Sucralose was approved for use in foods as a sweetener in 1998. Before approving sucralose, the FDA claimed to have reviewed 110 human and animal studies, but it turns out that only 2 out of those studies were actually on humans. “It is a chlorinated artificial sweetener in line with aspartame and saccharin, and with detrimental health effects to match,” explains Dr. Joseph Mercola. Let’s look as some of the potential health risks associated to Splenda. Reported symptoms: Seizures, Dizziness, Migraines, Allergic reactions, Weight gain and increases in blood sugar, Blurred vision, Gastrointestinal issues. The reason it is so important to know about the effects of sucralose is because it is the number one selling artificial sweetener in America today. Most of the controversy surrounding Splenda is the way it is advertised. “The sugar industry is currently suing McNeil Nutritionals for implying that Splenda is a natural form of sugar with no calories,” Mercola adds. What is sucralose really? The truth is that sucralose does start off as sugar, but it is what happens after that is the problem. In the factory, three chlorine molecules are added to the sugar molecule to make sucralose. This alters the chemical structure of the sugar, making it a molecule that does not exist in nature. Because it doesn’t exist in nature, the body does not metabolize or digest this molecule. If our bodies were able to metabolize it, then sucralose would no longer have zero calories. Such rumors, as UC Davis professor Carolyn de la Peña noted in her history of artificial sweeteners, have been fomented in part by the sweetener industry itself despite the established safety of those products:  The modern sweetener industry has thrived by regularly providing consumers with a new option and actively vilifying those that came before it as unnatural and very likely unsafe. The result of this approach, for consumers, is confusion. Obscured are the commonalities between these sweeteners that are, in the end, far more significant than the differences. All are chemicals. None has a closer connection to nature, in either origins or processing, than any other. And all are safe, if used in moderation. Were that not the case, certainly industry-driven scientists would have discovered their competitors’ weaknesses and publicized them to consumers well before Internet activists and independent filmmakers. As is typical in Internet-circulated food health warnings like the example reproduced above (which was largely cribbed from a seventeen-year-old article originally published on the questionable mercola.com web site), all of the information it presents is inaccurate, misleading, and/or outdated. The notion that sucralose has not been subjected to a reasonable and sufficient amount of safety testing is, in particular, woefully inaccurate. Sucralose has, across the span of many years, been subjected to extensive batteries of short-term and long-term studies in both animals and humans (more than a hundred of which were reviewed during the FDA approval process for sucralose), and none of them has demonstrated any significant risk to humans associated with the consumption of sucralose in normal amounts. A human tolerance study published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology in 2000, for example, found “no indication that adverse effects on human health would occur from frequent or long-term exposure to sucralose at the maximum anticipated levels of intake”:  Two tolerance studies were conducted in healthy human adult volunteers. The first study was an ascending dose study conducted in eight subjects, in which sucralose was administered at doses of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10mg/kg at 48-hour intervals and followed by daily dosing at 2mg/kg for 3 days and 5mg/kg for 4 days. In the second study, subjects consumed either sucralose (n=77) or fructose (50g/day) (n=31) twice daily in single blind fashion. Sucralose dosage levels were 125mg/day for weeks 1-3, 250mg/day during weeks 4-7, and 500mg/day during weeks 8-12. No adverse experiences or clinically detectable effects were attributable to sucralose in either study. Similarly, haematology, serum biochemistry, urinalysis and EKG tracings were unaffected by sucralose administration. In the 13-week study, serial slit lamp ophthalmologic examination performed in a random subset of the study groups revealed no changes. Fasting and 2-hour post-dosing blood sucralose concentrations obtained daily during week 12 of the study revealed no rising trend for blood sucralose. Sucralose was well tolerated by human volunteers in single doses up to 10mg/kg/day and repeated doses increasing to 5mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. Based on these studies and the extensive animal safety database, there is no indication that adverse effects on human health would occur from frequent or long-term exposure to sucralose at the maximum anticipated levels of intake. The chapter on sucralose in the textbook Artificial Sweeteners also surveys the extensive body of safety testing that has been performed on sucralose, including those involving long-term exposure and doses far in excess of recommended amounts:  Sucralose is one of the most tested food ingredients available today. It has been found safe for its intended use by health and food safety experts from around the world. Sucralose is permitted for use in more than 100 countries. It is used in thousands of food and beverage products worldwide and is safe for use over an entire lifetime. More than 100 scientific studies conducted to describe the safety of sucralose represent a methodical, intentional, and broad-range research program, as required by prominent health and food safety authorities. [R]esearch studies conducted in describing the safety of a new food ingredient must be rigorous and comprehensive. The studies conducted to assess the safety of sucralose investigated possible effects with short-term exposures and long-term, essentially lifetime, exposures, from conception to advanced adulthood. Many of the sucralose research studies utilized very high daily doses of sucralose, doses far greater that what could be expected to be consumed, to understand margins for safe use. Use of such high daily doses was particularly employed in the core sucralose research studies, in accordance with international standards for studies designed to determine potential risk. The most frequently cited study supposedly documenting the harmful effects of sucralose was one (conducted with rats, not humans, and funded by the Sugar Association) published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health in 2008 that reportedly found Splenda might “contribute to obesity, destroy ‘good’ intestinal bacteria and prevent prescription drugs from being absorbed.”  However, even that study was refuted by one published the following year in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology which reported that an Expert Panel had found that the previous study was “deficient in several critical areas” and that its conclusions “are not consistent with published literature and not supported by the data presented”:  A recent study in rats investigated the retail sweetener product, Granulated SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener (Splenda). The investigators reported that Splenda increased body weight, decreased beneficial intestinal bacteria, and increased the expression of certain cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and the transporter protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the latter of which was considered evidence that Splenda or sucralose might interfere with the absorption of nutrients and drugs. The investigators indicated that the reported changes were attributable to the sucralose present in the product tested. An Expert Panel conducted a rigorous evaluation of this study. In arriving at its conclusions, the Expert Panel considered the design and conduct of the study, its outcomes and the outcomes reported in other data available publicly. The Expert Panel found that the study was deficient in several critical areas and that its results cannot be interpreted as evidence that either Splenda, or sucralose, produced adverse effects in male rats, including effects on gastrointestinal microflora, body weight, CYP450 and P-gp activity, and nutrient and drug absorption. The study conclusions are not consistent with published literature and not supported by the data presented. The reference to sucralose’s being “a molecule that does not exist in nature,” one that “the body does not metabolize or digest” is both inaccurate and relatively meaningless. The fact that the human body does not metabolize sucralose for energy is a positive: it’s what makes sucralose non-caloric and therefore ideal as an artificial sweetener. Most sucralose is unabsorbed and therefore passes harmlessly through the body; a relatively small amount (~15%) of consumed sucralose is absorbed but is excreted via urination with no harmful effects:  In the body, sucralose is not able to be digested for energy. Further, sucralose is relatively poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The GIT is replete with enzymes that facilitate rapid uptake of monosaccharides; however, there is no digestion of sucralose at the level of the GIT (or elsewhere in the body). Thus, these enzymes have no impact on sucralose absorption, and specific studies show no active uptake of sucralose. About 85% of consumed sucralose is unabsorbed from the GIT and excreted unchanged in stool. A small amount (approximately 15%) of consumed sucralose is absorbed via passive diffusion across the GIT lumen. Consistent with sucralose being a highly water soluble, small and relatively inert substance, absorbed sucralose is distributed to essentially all tissues and readily excreted in urine. There is no active transport into milk, transplacentally, or across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. Sucralose is not used as a source of energy. It is not dechlorinated, and there is no evidence of degradation to any smaller chlorinated compounds. Sucralose does not bind to proteins in the body, consistent with its relatively non-reactive nature. Most absorbed sucralose, and all unabsorbed sucralose, is excreted unchanged within 24 hours. As is also typical with Internet-circulated food health warnings, the accompanying laundry list of “reported symptoms” should be taken with many grains of salt. Self-reported adverse events are simply anecdotal raw data; there is no certainty that the reported events were actually due to the product consumed, much less that they demonstrate a causal relationship between the product and the reported events (especially after consumers are influenced by reading anti-sucralose reports that list what symptoms they’re “supposed” to be experiencing). Such determinations cannot be made until reports have been investigated, evaluated, and analyzed, and no studies have confirmed that the symptoms listed are a common reaction to sucralose. As Dr. Joe Schwarz observed in his work on food myths and misconceptions:  As with any substance, there can be no absolute guarantee about the safety of sucralose for everyone. Any food or additive, be it peanuts or apples, aspartame or sucralose, can cause a problem for some people. But reactions to sucralose are rare indeed. There is one thing this piece did get right, although it’s both outdated and irrelevant to the issue of the safety of sucralose: the manufacturer of Splenda was indeed sued (nearly fourteen years ago) by a competitor over their slogan “made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar,” which falsely implied to consumers that Splenda “in some way actually was sugar, but with the calories stripped out”:  In November 2004, Merisant, manufacturer of the table-top, aspartame-based sweetener Equal, sued McNeil Nutritionals, a division of Johnson and Johnson and the manufacturer of Splenda, for false and misleading advertising in Splenda’s “made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar” campaign. Merisant invoked the Lanham Act, which prohibits false or misleading advertisements to American consumers, to stop McNeil from making several claims in television and print advertisements that suggested that Splenda was like sugar, only with the calories removed. After three years of fighting in the courts, Johnson and Johnson settled, just before the jury was to return what appeared to be a ruling awarding damages in favor of the plaintiff. Sucralose, the chemical in the brand-named product Splenda, does, in fact, originate with the sucrose (sugar) molecule. It then undergoes a process of molecule replacement, however, that renders it qualitatively different. After the lawsuit was settled, Splenda debuted a new slogan: “Just What’s Good — it’s made from sugar. It tastes like sugar. But it’s not sugar.” On 11 March 2016, numerous news outlets reported that an Italian study (published in January 2016) purportedly documented a link between Splenda and cancer in mice. The International Food Information Council (IFIC), a non-profit group aimed at providing science-based evidence with respect to food safety, addressed the publication of the study in an article that criticized the study’s methodology and dissonant findings:  As Trevor Butterworth expertly articulated during the last unsupported sucralose scare from these researchers: The problem hanging over the Splenda finding is that which hangs over the Ramazzini Institute in general: Quality control. No matter what substance the Institute tests for cancer, the results always seem to be positive, whereas other laboratories testing the same substances repeatedly fail to come up with the same findings. […] All of this has made the Ramazzini Institute something of a joke in European and American science. But, of course, there’s nothing to laugh about when you use a charity conference on childhood cancer to promote an international cancer panic. The FDA and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have both come out on the Ramazzini Institute?s previous work, saying that their conclusions aren’t supported by the data. Dr. Magnuson summed it up perfectly: “There are many other problems with this study that we could discuss, such as diet formulation, doses used, lack of dose response, and so on — but the critical point is that it has been well documented that the results from studies by this laboratory are not valid — especially when it comes to lymphoma and leukemia.”  IFIC concluded that the “safety and effectiveness of sucralose (and other low-calorie sweeteners in foods) is incredibly well supported,” and added that “you shouldn’t hesitate to swap them into your diet” in efforts to reduce caloric intake. On 11 March 2016, Splenda issues a statement via their Facebook page referencing the IFIC article and asserting the Italian study’s conclusion was an outlier among dozens to the contrary:  Researchers have conducted more than 100 scientific studies on the safety of sucralose over the past 20 years, and they’ve all declared sucralose safe to enjoy. Sometimes, however, poorly conducted and unscientific studies make bold headlines and stir up safety fears. This [IFIC] article sets the record straight[.]",1
"Health workers have been better prepared than ever for this latest epidemic of the hemorrhagic fever, which causes severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, and kills more than half those it infects. New technologies like a trial vaccine, experimental treatments and futuristic cube-shaped mobile units for treating patients have helped curb the spread of the virus. But public mistrust and rampant insecurity in the parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where Ebola has struck have hampered the response, complicating the fight against it. Five Ebola centers have been attacked since last month, sometimes by armed assailants. The violence led French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend its activities at the epicenter of the outbreak last month. As a result, it is now the second-deadliest in history, behind the 2013-16 one in West Africa that is believed to have killed more than 11,000 people. “The total is now 1,009 cases,” the ministry said in a statement, but it added: “the response, led by the Health Ministry in collaboration with its partners, has limited the geographical spread.”  Last Wednesday, authorities confirmed a case of Ebola in Bunia, another city of close to 1 million people.",0
"""Here’s a scary story. A mother in Mexico thinks that her 2-year-old has a cold and puts Vicks VapoRub on his chest and under his nose. She lies down next to him and when she wakes, she finds the child dead. The tale began moving through the Web in November. Smag31.com, a website that targets young mothers, carried it on Nov. 25 with the headline, """"Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies."""" But so far as anyone can tell, the story is untrue. Vicks VapoRub has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, but not to any deaths. The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news. Bruce Rubin, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth University, has followed questions about Vicks VapoRub for a decade. In 2009, he published a peer-reviewed article based on a case he had encountered a few years before. The parents of an 18-month-old had put Vicks under the child’s nose and the child immediately stopped breathing. They quickly turned the child upside down, slapped it on the back and it coughed up a plug of mucus. Its breathing returned to normal. But Rubin told us that in the 10 years since that case, he’s seen no report of any deaths. On the other hand, episodes of breathing distress while rare, are not unheard of. """"I understand that there have been about 30 such reports, all with Vicks under the nose of very small children,"""" Rubin said. """"Procter and Gamble (the maker of Vicks) specifically states never to use this directly under the nose at any age, and never use at all in children under the age of 2."""" To underscore, that is what the label says. Never under the nose. Never with kids under 2. A 2012 study looked at what happens when menthol, one of Vicks’ active ingredients, is inhaled. It found that the body responds by making more mucus, but again, the authors cited no example of a child actually dying. Jennifer Lowry, head of toxicology at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ environmental health council, said, """"I have never heard, nor could I find a report of, a patient dying from inhaling Vicks VapoRub."""" Lowry said as a pediatric medical toxicologist, she has concerns about any product that contains camphor, as Vicks does. But her main worry is that parents will do exactly the wrong thing and have kids eat it. That’s very dangerous. Procter and Gamble spokeswoman Velvet Gogol Bennett said the company has never had a family report a fatality due to inhaling Vicks VapoRub. """"We have had no local health authority notification, no hospital notification, nor any doctor or any official news organization anywhere in the world has brought this case to our attention,"""" Bennett said. """"Despite all of our efforts to investigate this social media posting, there is no verifiable information in terms of city and name of the person concerned."""" The blog post about the alleged death said, """"The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment."""" If such a medical report exists, no researcher we contacted seems to have ever seen it. We reached out to the author behind the blog and did not hear back. The myth-busting website Snopes also looked into this and found it lacked substance. A Canadian study looked at cases of children eating Vicks or similar products. Those situations sent children to the emergency room, but were not fatal. The one exception was in 1983 involving a child with pneumonia whose parents had given him a home remedy that contained camphor and alcohol. Rubin said if people follow instructions, Vicks is fine: """"If you are an adult with a stuffy head cold, putting Vicks on your chest and drinking some hot tea with honey (and perhaps rum) is as good a medicine as it gets. Just keep the Vicks (and the rum) away from the under-2 crowd."""" Our ruling A blog post said that Vicks VapoRub caused a child’s death in Mexico. While the product has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, there is no evidence that it has been fatal.""",1
"In late August 2019, a screenshot from a local news broadcast shared alongside the text “THC will be removed from substance charts for drug test screenings starting August 30th” went viral:  THC is the primary active component of cannabis. As this photo spread across the internet, its context appeared to have been lost. Some users shared the image thinking it applied only to certain states. Others took it to mean that this was a nationwide legal change. Most commenters appeared to have assumed the claim referred to all potential users of cannabis. In reality, the claim that THC will be removed from drug-test screenings starting Aug. 30 (2019) applied only to people who are residents of Oklahoma and who have valid medical-marijuana licenses (note the Oklahoma City-based KOCO 5 television station logo appearing in the above screenshot). The law in question — Senate Bill 2612 — was introduced in the Oklahoma legislature on Feb. 4, and was signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt on March 14. A lengthy compromise bill about the future of medical marijuana in that state, the law does stipulate that “no employer may refuse to hire, discipline, discharge or otherwise penalize an applicant or employee solely on the basis of a positive test for marijuana components or metabolites” unless: According to The Oklahoman, the law actually took effect on Aug. 29, 2019. Because the law applies only to a very narrow subset of the American population despite being shared across the country without these caveats.",1
"""There are no graveyards for ridiculous, oft-debunked chain emails. A lengthy, widespread email keeps resurfacing with dire warnings about Obamacare as determined by Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. """"Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on,"""" the email begs. """"We all need to be informed."""" Unfortunately, the email is riddled with errors, starting with the fact that is referring to an initial 2009 health care proposal that never became law. Still, because it has the subject line """"Obama Care Outrage,"""" we thought people might confuse it with the health care law on the books. In that context, and given all the talk about potential immigration reform, one line jumped out: """"The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally,"""" the email states. Make no mistake, this line is wrong in the context of the 2009 law (! wrong, in fact), and wrong in the context of the health care bill President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Let us explain. The Affordable Care Act contains an individual mandate that requires individuals to purchase health insurance. It allows U.S. citizens and legal residents to purchase insurance on health insurance exchanges, often receiving tax credits. But none of it applies to people who are here illegally. They don’t have to follow the mandate because they shouldn’t be here. They remain ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage, just as they are ineligible for food stamps. They cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges (thus, they are also ineligible for tax credits to offset the cost of getting that coverage). Now, certain low-income illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, including childbirth and surgery. And federal law requires hospitals not to turn away individuals for emergency treatment, even if they are uninsured (or undocumented), according to the National Immigration Law Center. But those policies predate the Affordable Care Act. """"They don’t get health insurance, which is coverage, which is different than a hospital getting reimbursed for Medicaid,"""" said Laura Goodhue, executive director of Florida Chain, a consumer health advocacy group. The Affordable Care Act does provide some benefits for certain legal non-U.S. citizens. We repeat: Legal. Immigrants who are in the country legally are subject to the mandate and are eligible to shop on the exchanges. Thanks to the Supreme Court and Florida legislators, certain poor, legal noncitizens have it a little easier in Florida than the state's most impoverished citizens. The law includes a special rule (page 108) allowing them to get tax credits to purchase health insurance on an exchange if they (a) do not qualify for Medicaid because they have not been here for the required five years and (b) earn at or below the poverty line. Meanwhile, about 1 million of Florida’s poorest citizens will continue not to have affordable access to health insurance. They are not eligible to receive tax credits for the exchanges, and Florida leaders did not expand Medicaid coverage to include them during the 2013 legislative session. Goodhue calls it a """"black hole"""" of coverage. Republican Gov. Jan Brewer had noticed a similar scenario playing out in Arizona if its leaders did not expand Medicaid, saying, """"For poor Arizonans below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, only legal immigrants, but not citizens, would be eligible for subsidies."""" Our ruling The chain email says that Obamacare provides insurance """"to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally."""" It’s actually citing a 2009 proposal that didn’t pass, but that doesn’t really matter. The email’s wrong either way. The Affordable Care Act does nothing to provide health insurance to anyone living in the United States illegally. It does offer some assistance to legal non-U.S. citizens, which by the way is different than a non-U.S. resident as the email claims. (A non-U.S. resident could be living in Mexico, France or even Mars). We rate this claim !""",1
"""In a speech on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2009, Republican Rep. Mike Pence sounded off about what's in the stimulus bill before Congress. """"In legislation before the Senate this week, $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers or $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is not going to put this economy back on track,"""" Pence said. """"And, it was exactly that kind of wasteful government spending that resulted in unanimous Republican opposition last week."""" We wanted to check to see if the bill includes the money Pence mentioned. Some of our previous reports have shown that opponents of the bill have not been  completely   truthful  about what's in the bill. In this case, Pence is right. The Senate report on the bill, as of this writing, includes $20 million """"for the removal of small- to medium-sized fish passage barriers,"""" which means  clearing barriers  in rivers and streams to allow fish migration. It's part of an overall $190 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for habitat restoration projects that """"accomplish ecological goals and provide employment opportunities in the local communities."""" The report also says the projects can be modified to """"achieve the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources."""" Similarly, the $25 million for recreation maintenance, """"especially for rehabilitation of off-road vehicle routes,"""" is part of an overall $135 million for the Bureau of Land Management, which includes funding for trail maintenance, remediation for environmental and public safety hazards on public lands, and habitat restoration. This passage also allows for modification for """"the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources."""" A Democratic spokesman defended the funding when we asked about Pence's criticism. """"Preserving our national parks and preserving our wildlife don't seem to be unreasonable goals,"""" said Rob Blumenthal, a Democratic spokesman for the Senate Committee on Appropriations. """"These are ready-to-go jobs that will employ American workers."""" The Fish and Wildlife Service said the work to remove fish barriers is """"shovel ready"""" and includes projects like building bypasses around large dams and demolishing obsolete mill runs that date back to colonial times. """"There's going to be a lot of work for local contractors,"""" said Fish and Wildlife spokesman Chris Tollefson. """"We're talking about restoring native fish runs all over the country."""" We'll let others decide if the projects are worthy or not. We should point out that almost any job the government pays someone to do is technically stimulating the economy by creating income and reducing unemployment, if only by the smallest amount. Also, the two projects combined account for not even 1 percent of the bill — more like .005 percent. Nevertheless, $45 million for most people is serious money. When he made his remarks, Pence had his facts straight on what was in the legislation — $20 million for fish-barrier removal and $25 million for off-road trails.""",0
"With the blockbuster success of the film American Sniper, the legacy of   former NAVY SEAL Chris Kyle has taken on mythic proportions. As is often   the case when this happens, some events of Kyle’s life have been   embellished and exaggerated in the re-telling of old stories and   accounts. Chris Kyle is the most decorated and revered sniper in American military history and had more than 150 confirmed   kills during his time in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kyle’s heroism and service give reason to celebrate his life, however, the public and   media often seek even more from legendary figures like Kyle. The truth   often blurs in the telling and retelling of legendary figures’ stories,   and Kyle is no different. Here’s a look at how some of the most common claims about Kyle got   started, and whether or not they’re true:  Claims about the historical accuracy of American Sniper  Claims about the accuracy of American Sniper are off base. Clint   Eastwood, the film’s director, said it portrays one soldier’s   perspective of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — not an objective,   historically accurate account. The Star  reports:  “Still, in making American Sniper, which he took over after Steven Spielberg bowed out due to budget restrictions, Eastwood felt he had to properly represent Kyle’s version of events. ‘This picture was interesting, because I’m seeing it from the point of a person who was sort of an American hero, as far as his ability to be this ultra-sniper. And his family and his beliefs were very strong about defending the country and defending the guys who are defending the country, as a sort of an oversight warrior. It was an important story, but you have to embrace his philosophy if you’re going to tell a story about him,’ Clint Eastwood said.”  Chris Kyle Killed Looters During Hurricane Katrina  The claim that Chris Kyle killed 30 looters in New Orleans from a perch   on top of the Superdome in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is false. The rumor started after Chris Kyle reportedly told the  story to a private group of Navy SEALS after a moderated   discussion with SOFREP, a website that covers special-operations   forces. The New Yorker  reports:  “(After the discussion), a larger group went out for dinner, closed the hotel bar, and hung out in Kyle’s suite, drinking until late. The SEALs began telling stories, and Kyle offered a shocking one. In the days after Hurricane Katrina, he said, the law-and-order situation was dire. He and another sniper travelled to New Orleans, set up on top of the Superdome, and proceeded to shoot dozens of armed residents who were contributing to the chaos. Three people shared with me varied recollections of that evening: the first said that Kyle claimed to have shot thirty men on his own; according to the second, the story was that Kyle and the other sniper had shot thirty men between them; the third said that she couldn’t recall specific details. A spokesperson for the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) told the   New Yorker that “no West Coast SEALs deployed to Katrina.” One of Chris   Kyle’s superiors said he’d never heard the story, and he added that it   “defies the imagination” to believe that dozens of people were shot with   high-velocity rifles and then disappeared. Chris Kyle Killed Two Carjackers in Texas  The claim that Chris Kyle killed two carjackers in Texas is false. The  account first appeared in D Magazine in April of 2013:  “Two guys approached him with pistols and demanded his money and the keys to his truck. With his hands in the air, he sized up which man seemed most confident with his gun. He told the robbers that he just needed to reach back into the truck to get the keys. He turned around and reached under his winter coat instead, into his waistband. With his right hand, he grabbed his Colt 1911. He fired two shots under his left armpit, hitting the first man twice in the chest. Then he turned slightly and fired two more times, hitting the second man twice in the chest. Both men fell dead. Kyle leaned on his truck and waited for the police. When they arrived, they detained him while they ran his driver’s license. But instead of his name, address, and date of birth, what came up was a phone number at the Department of Defense. At the other end of the line was someone who explained that the police were in the presence of one of the most skilled fighters in U.S. military history. When they reviewed the surveillance footage, the officers found the incident had happened just as Kyle had described it. They were very understanding, and they didn’t want to drag a just-home, highly decorated veteran into a messy legal situation.”  D Magazine worked with Chris Kyle on the story, but the writer doesn’t   say that Kyle told him the story. In fact, the writer doesn’t say where   the account came from. A later  article in the New Yorker said Kyle told the story to friends   who later retold it to reporters. Either way, the incident likely didn’t   happen, the New Yorker reports:  “There is cause to be skeptical. The counties of Erath, Somervell, and Johnson cover the stretch of highway where the incident supposedly happened. Tommy Bryant, the sheriff of Erath County, told me that he could ‘guar-an-damn-tee it didn’t happen here.’ Greg Doyle, the sheriff of Somervell County, said that he had ‘never heard” the story, which he found “kinda shocking,’ and added, ‘It did not occur here.’ Bob Alford, the sheriff of Johnson County, told a local reporter, ‘If something like that happened here I would have heard of it, and I’m sure you all at the newspaper would have heard of it.’  “These denials do not automatically disprove the story, of course. And it’s true that certain operatives, from certain government offices and agencies, drive government-registered vehicles whose license plates prompt civilian authorities to contact a call center in the event of an accident or a traffic stop. But a SEAL with extensive experience in special-mission units told me that the notion of such a provision being in place for a former SEAL driving a private vehicle was ‘bull.’”  Chris Kyle Knocked Out Jesse Venture  This claim is false, and it landed Chris Kyle’s estate in federal court. In his memoir, Kyle told a story about punching an unnamed celebrity   called “Scruff Face” because the celebrity allegedly said that the SEALs   “deserved to lose a few” during the war. The Washington Post reports:  “Kyle did not identify Ventura by name in the book, but said that he swung at the individual after he ‘started running his mouth about the war and everything and anything he could connect to it.’ That included President George W. Bush and deployed SEALs, who ‘were doing the wrong thing, killing men and women and children and murdering,’ the man said, according to Kyle’s book. Ventura said the whole episode was fabricated. Kyle later said in media interviews while promoting his book that ‘Scruff Face’ was Ventura, who served in the Navy’s Underwater Demolition Teams during the Vietnam War era.”  Ventura said the incident didn’t happen and sued Chris Kyle and his   estate for defamation. At trial, Ventura’s lawyers successfully argued   that the made-up fight had drummed up publicity and interest in Kyle’s   book, which led to more book sales. Ventura’s lawyers pointed to a   picture of Ventura at the event in question that showed no black eye or   bruises, which contradicted Kyle’s account of the alleged fight. Witnesses also testified. A jury in Minnesota sided with Ventura and   awarded him $1.8 million in July of 2014, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. Most of the proceeds from the “American Sniper” book were not donated to   veterans  It’s true that the vast majority of royalties generated by the sale of   Chris Kyle’s memoirs were not donated to the families of marines in   2013. After Chris Kyle was killed in early 2013, HarperCollins, the publisher   of his book, released a  statement that said Kyle had “dedicated his life in recent   years to supporting veterans and donated the proceeds of American Sniper   to the families of his fallen friends.”  But Chris Kyle’s widow, Taya, testified in court in July of 2014 that   although the couple didn’t intend to profit from the book, they had. The   Kyles planned to donate much of the book’s $3 million in royalties to   veterans and their families, Taya Kyle said, but they couldn’t because   of gift tax laws that prevented them from giving more than $13,000 to   each family in 2013. The National Review  estimates that $52,000 (or about 2% of American Snipers’ 2013   royalties) had gone to the families of fallen veterans.",1
"The department revealed it had contemplated using the drug in a court filing last month, which has not been previously reported. In the end, it decided against adopting the drug for executions. Attorney General William Barr announced in July his department instead would use pentobarbital, a barbiturate, when it resumes federal executions later this year, ending a de facto moratorium on the punishment put in place by the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama. But the special consideration given to the possibilities of fentanyl, even as federal agents were focused on seizing illegal imports of the synthetic opioid, show how much has changed since the federal government last carried out an execution nearly 20 years ago. Many pharmaceutical companies have since put tight controls on their distribution channels to stop their drugs being used in executions. As old supply chains vanished, many states, and the federal government in turn, have been forced to tinker with their lethal recipes. They have experimented with different drugs, in some cases leading to grisly “botched” executions in which the condemned prisoners have visibly suffered prolonged, excruciating deaths, viewed by some as a breach of the constitutional ban on “cruel and unusual” punishments. In 2017, Nebraska and Nevada announced they would use fentanyl, which is 100 times more powerful than morphine, in new multi-drug execution protocols. By 2018, the U.S. Justice Department was also examining the “use of fentanyl as part of a lethal injection protocol,” according to a three-page internal memorandum from March 2018 by the director of the department’s Bureau of Prisons. The Justice Department revealed the memo’s existence in an August court filing after a federal judge ordered it to produce a complete “administrative record” showing how it arrived at the new pentobarbital execution protocol announced in July. The full contents of the memo are not public. It is not known why the department decided to examine fentanyl, what supply channels were considered or why it ultimately rejected fentanyl as a protocol. The government’s court filing shows the only other named drug examined as the subject of a department memo was pentobarbital, the drug it now says it wants to use in December and January to kill five of the 61 prisoners awaiting execution on federal death row. Wyn Hornbuckle, a department spokesman, declined to share a copy of the memo or to answer questions about the government’s execution protocol. Mark Inch, who was the Bureau of Prisons’ director at the time, acknowledged in a brief telephone interview writing the memo. Inch, who abruptly resigned a couple months after writing the memo, declined to answer questions, in part because he said it would be in conflict with his current role running Florida’s Department of Corrections. Doctors can prescribe fentanyl for treating severe pain. In recent years, illegal fentanyl has become a common additive in bootleg pain pills and other street drugs, contributing to the tens of thousands of opioid overdose deaths in the country each year. Even tiny quantities can slow or stop a person’s breathing. Earlier this year, an Ohio lawmaker proposed using some of the illegal fentanyl seized from drug traffickers to execute condemned inmates. Death penalty researchers say that just because a drug is deadly does not mean it is always appropriate as an execution drug. “I don’t think it’d be a surprise that the government would be looking at alternative methods of carrying out lethal injection, and fentanyl has been in the news,” Robert Dunham, the director of the Washington-based non-profit group the Death Penalty Information Center, said in an interview. “But there is just something fundamentally wrong about using a drug implicated in illegal activities as your method of executing prisoners.”   In August 2018, Carey Dean Moore became the first person in the United States to be executed using a protocol that included fentanyl. Nebraska prison officials injected him with fentanyl and three other drugs. Moore took 23 minutes to die. Witnesses said that before succumbing, Moore breathed heavily and coughed and that his face turned red, then purple.",1
"Despite touting the benefits of CPAP, the news release made no mention of the costs of CPAP home machines. These machines aren’t cheap–a quick internet search shows that they can run anywhere from $500 to over $1,000, not including other necessary equipment such as face masks and cleaning supplies. While the National Sleep Foundation says that most insurance policies cover CPAP machines, it is likely that someone buying a machine will still have to pay a hefty out-of-pocket sum. This could prove to be an obstacle to many seeking treatment, especially people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The news release was vague about how much patients benefited, and didn’t provide any numbers from the study itself to put the findings in context. While the release said that “results show that there were significant and clinically meaningful improvements,” for patients using CPAP, the reader has no idea what that ultimately means. It would have been helpful if the news release provided some numerical indicators that demonstrated exactly how much the intervention helped. While CPAP therapy is relatively safe, there are still common side effects that were not mentioned in the news release. According to the National Sleep Foundation, most CPAP users will experience some mild side effects including congestion, runny nose, or stomach bloating. Though the harms are only mildly irritating, it would have been helpful if they were included in the release. The release mentioned that there were over 2,000 people in the study, that it was conducted over a period of four years, and that scores on two different questionnaires were used to measure benefits. The study itself mentioned some additional limitations, including the fact that it was a retrospective study and there was no control arm. These limitations should have been included in the news release as well. No disease mongering in this news release. The news release did include a section at the bottom describing the funding sources for the study. However, it neglected to note that the first author has ties to two industry companies (Phillips Respironics and ResMed), both of which make money on the sale and upkeep of CPAP machines and supplies. This is an important financial conflict of interest to include. While CPAP is a widely used and effective treatment for sleep apnea, it is not the only solution. Other treatments include dental appliances, surgery, and nerve stimulation. The news release did not make any mentions of these alternate treatments. The news release made no mention of the availability of CPAP machines, even though they are easy to find. As mentioned above, however, their cost can often be prohibitive. It would have been helpful if the news release discussed low-cost options, especially since they mentioned that the intervention seemed to have less effect for lower socio-economic subgroups. This is the main problem with the news release: how is the fact that PAP helps sleep apnea news? CPAP machines were first used in the early 1970s, and since then there has been a large body of evidence that PAP is helpful for sleep apnea patients. In the study discussion, the authors include one sentence that attempts to establish the novelty of their research: “Our study differs from the existing clinical studies because it includes a robustly large number of patients and utilizes both sleep-related and global QoL instruments.” They seem to be saying that their study is novel on two accounts: the large sample size, and the fact that they use two different questionnaires as measurements. But is this enough to warrant a news release on a treatment that has already been studied extensively? Including this information would have helped readers to draw their own conclusions on this question. No unjustifiable or sensational language here.",1
"""It isn't often that U.S. campaigns venture into Latin American retirement policy, but the knock-down, drag-out battle for a Nevada Senate seat has done just that. It came up in an ad run by the Patriot Majority PAC, an obscure Washington-based group that appears to be spending big money on campaign advertising this year, primarily against Sharron Angle, the Republican who's challenging Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev. The ad seizes on a comment made by Angle about Social Security privatization during an Aug. 12, 2010, interview with KLAS-TV. Here's the narration:  """"How does Sharron Angle plan to phase out Social Security? (Video of Angle saying, """"Chile has done this."""") Chile? The country once led by Augusto Pinochet, the military dictator and human rights violator? Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage. (Angle: """"Chile has done this."""") Privatize? Phase out? Pinochet? (Angle: """"Chile has done this."""") Another day, and another bad idea from Sharron Angle. What's next?"""" We were somewhat caught off guard by the ad sponsor's effort to use Angle's pension-policy positions to link her to a """"military dictator and human rights violator,"""" complete with footage of goose-stepping Chilean soldiers on parade. But that connection, tenuous though it may be, didn't strike us as checkable in our conventional sense. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad fairly describes the nuts and bolts of Chilean retirement security. Is the ad justified in saying that """"Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage""""? For many years, the Chilean system has been an inspiration to free-market advocates in the U.S. and elsewhere, so it's not surprising that Angle would have cited it. Here's some background on the system. Chile created its first Social Security-style programs in the 1920s, a decade or so before the United States did. But the government under Pinochet made a big change in 1981, transitioning all new workers -- as well as beneficiaries of the old, defined-benefit system who were willing to make the switch -- to a pension plan based on individual accounts run by private-sector investment managers. By now, almost all Chileans are enrolled in the post-1981 system. The program details have changed somewhat over the years, most recently due to a major round of changes in 2008. But the general outline has remained the same. Ten percent of workers' income is automatically deducted to fund their retirement, disability and survivor insurance, plus an additional charge for administrative costs. Employees can choose from among several government-approved private pension management companies, each of which offers five varieties of funds with varying degrees of risk. The funds and their approaches have been reviewed by a government regulator. Total assets in the system by the end of 2009 reached $107 billion in U.S dollars, or about 65 percent of Chile’s gross domestic product. Because the Chilean system has been a trendsetter, it has been studied extensively. Independent analyses suggest that over the long term, the level of support for retirees under Chile's system has been close or better than that in similar countries. But the Chilean system has also faced its share of criticism. Some of that criticism echoes what the ad says. Here's a closer look at the three issues raised in the ad. • Hidden fees. High fees have been a longstanding concern about the Chilean system. Due to lack of competition among private-sector money managers that participate in the system, these management companies' profits have been much larger than profit margins in other sectors of Chile’s financial services industry, wrote U.S. Social Security Administration researcher Barbara E. Kritzer in one paper. Over a full career contributing to the system, workers pay around 15 percent for administration, according to the International Organization of Pension Supervisors. This is in the middle of six Latin American countries and below five Eastern European countries with a Chilean-style individual accounts system. Several experts said that a series of government reforms in 2008 helped lower fees. In our reporting, we found that even supporters of the system acknowledged that fees have been a problem. But are they """"hidden,"""" as the ad says? None of the handful of experts we spoke to said so. In fact, fees are more obvious to contributors in Chile than in other countries because they are levied on top of the mandatory contribution to private pensions. So while the ad is on track in its criticism of fees, it is wrong to say they are hidden. • Fewer benefits. Most studies have shown a long-term rate of return in the Chilean system of roughly 10 percent, which is high by international standards. But even if those rates of return are optimistic going forward -- whether because they were boosted by a period of unusually strong returns or because of insufficient participation by Chilean workers in the plan -- experts we spoke to agreed that for Chileans, the current system is preferable to the pre-1981 system. In fact, Pinochet's system remained in place after the transition to democracy and was retained by the socialist administration of Michelle Bachelet. (Bachelet lost power in March 2010.) Mauricio Soto of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has written that the old pension system was """"in crisis"""" prior to 1981 -- paying more in benefits than it was receiving in contributions, with a projected actuarial imbalance greater than the country's gross domestic product. In addition, the patchwork system was """"poorly administered and inefficient"""" and led to discrepancies in which """"white-collar workers could comfortably retire in their 40s, while blue-collar workers had to wait until their 60s to qualify for minimum retirement benefits."""" There's no question that the current investor-based pension system carries risks, being subject to markets that can go up or down. But Chile's old system simply wasn't sustainable. """"It was unfunded and essentially a fantasy,"""" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime champion of the Chilean system. So to suggest, as the ad does, that switching to a private system in 1981 resulted in """"fewer benefits"""" is at best misleading. • Millions of people with no coverage. This charge is true -- but misleading for a couple reasons. Though the proportion of Chileans participating in the system has varied over time, the percentage has hovered around two-thirds, a rate similar to under the pre-1981 system. This is clearly less than the nearly universal coverage provided by the U.S. Social Security system. But Chile is also not nearly as rich as the U.S.  Several experts we spoke to agreed that the coverage gaps have at least as much to do with the nature of the Chilean economy as with the design of the country's retirement system. Soto notes that low-income Chileans working in the underground economy account for about 30 percent of the workforce. These workers are typically not covered by the pension system unless they have previously worked in a legitimate business. Meanwhile, participation by the self-employed was for many years voluntary (and very low), though mandatory participation is being phased in by the 2008 reforms. Even among workers in traditional jobs, participation rates have usually topped out around 80 percent, with the percentage taking part at any given time even lower, since workers do not always keep up their contributions due to unemployment or a failure to comply with the law. This is a serious issue. As Kritzer notes, """"only a small portion"""" of workers with less-than-perfect participation histories """"would have enough contributions to qualify for the guaranteed minimum benefit at retirement."""" The 2008 reform addressed coverage concerns by introducing a universal pension paid to all Chileans over the age of 65 regardless of their contribution history. In addition, workers with small pensions from their individual accounts will have them topped up by the government. While we think it's fair for the ad to note that the Chilean system has holes, it's important to note that the pre-1981 system had holes too -- and that the nature of the Chilean economy plays at least as big a role in causing this problem as the retirement system itself. So where does this leave us? The ad demonizes the Chilean system in ways that we think are exaggerated. Fees are a problem, but they are not hidden. Rather than offering smaller benefits, the system has provided strong returns and is almost certainly sounder today than prior to 1981. And the coverage gaps that exist now are not unique to the privatized system and have a lot to do with specific factors at play in Chile. The ad does have a point that the Chilean system, at least if it's implemented without major differences, would likely be seen by most Americans as inferior to Social Security. The size of the coverage gaps in Chile's system, while understandable given Chile's economic situation, would be unacceptable to many, if not most, Americans. But this reasonable point is undercut by the ad's overheated rhetoric (""""human rights violator""""), imagery (the goose-stepping soldiers) and exaggerations about the substance of the Chilean plan.""",1
"""A grim statistic is circulating this World Malaria Day. USAID’s Tina Dooley-Jones, deputy mission director in Kenya, marked the occasion in Nairobi saying that """"globally, malaria kills a child every two minutes."""" Dooley-Jones is far from the only one with that message. It plays large among malaria advocacy groups like Nothing But Nets. So it was curious to see a post in January on Medium from the head of the President’s Malaria Initiative, rear admiral Tim Ziemer, with the statement that """"in Africa, a child dies every minute because of the disease."""" The initiative is one of the government’s largest global health efforts. It began under President George W. Bush and has been carried forward by President Barack Obama. Malaria’s toll among African children is a touchstone for many health activists, but the numbers can vary. Our colleagues at Africa Check spotted a range of statements. One organization claimed a child died every 30 seconds, another said once every two minutes, and in between was Ziemer’s figure. In this fact-check, we affirm that the correct number is closer to once every two minutes. USAID spokesman Ryan Essman told us that until fairly recently, his agency would talk about a death every one to two minutes, but now uses the two-minute time frame. """"Admiral Ziemer has been working with malaria for a decade,"""" Essman said. """"He had it when he was child. Usually he uses the right number, but he might have slipped in the previous one."""" As a humanitarian matter, the exact death toll makes little difference. This table from the Kaiser Family Foundation, using World Health Organization data, clearly shows that Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria. WHO Region Number of countries with ongoing transmission Estimated cases (1,000s) Percentage Estimated deaths (in 1,000s) Percentage Global total 96 214,000 100% 438 100% Africa 44 188,000 88% 395 90% Americas 21 660 <1% 0.5 <1% Eastern Mediterranean 8 3,900 2% 6.8 2% Europe 3 0 0% 0 0% South-East Asia 10 20,000 9% 32 7% Western Pacific 10 1,500 <1% 3.2 <1%  Africa wrestles with 90 percent of all deaths by the disease worldwide, and almost as large a percentage of active cases. Malaria is particularly lethal for pregnant women and their babies. The federal government estimates that it kills about 10,000 expectant mothers each year in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another 200,000 children will die prematurely from complications due to their mothers having bouts of malaria during pregnancy. Malaria’s death toll Our colleagues at Africa Check turned to the World Health Organization data for 2015. With huge gaps in the health care systems in many African nations, all experts agree that a precise count of malaria death is impossible. The WHO provides a range of estimates. Number of malaria deaths in children under 5 in Africa Middle estimate 292,000 Lowest estimate 212,000 Highest estimate 384,000  From that, the middle estimate shows one child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds, or close to once every two minutes. Middle estimate 1 min 48 sec Lowest estimate 2 min 28 sec Highest estimate 1 min 22 sec  The U.S. government spent about $860 million this fiscal year to fight malaria. The money went for a drug that can help pregnant women and their children, but many dollars also went to insecticide-treated nets and indoor spraying to prevent people from catching the disease in the first place. Obama seeks to raise the total by about another $70 million in the last budget of his administration. There is a strong global push to eradicate malaria, and gains have been made. In the past decade and a half, the rate of new cases has fallen by about a third in Sub-Saharan Africa. Going forward, many hurdles remain. Mosquitoes can become resistant to the most common insecticides, weak health care systems in many countries make it difficult to sustain antimalaria programs, and counterfeit drugs can be as fatal as the disease itself. Our ruling Ziemer wrote that malaria kills a child in Africa each minute. His staff at USAID said that figure is off. A better estimate is that a child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds. But even that figure comes with a measure of uncertainty. The actual death rate could be higher or lower. By any estimate, malaria remains a serious threat to children in Africa.""",0
"On 30 March 2016, web site The Free Thought Project published an article reporting that the state of Mississippi had passed a bill granting churches the power to act as “soldiers of God,” with congregants gaining the ability to legally kill other citizens while taking part in religious services: As if police officers kidnapping, beating, and killing innocent people in America with impunity wasn’t enough, the state of Mississippi just passed a Bill that will grant churches equal protection from acts of violence. Mississippi House Bill 786, the “Mississippi Church Protection Act” legalizes killing people while acting as a participant of a church or place of worship — seriously. This Bill legally recognizes actual “soldiers of Christ” and grants them the power to kill. By passing this bill, the state of Mississippi effectively recognizes churches as their own sovereign entities — mini-states that are tax-free and immune from their acts of violence carried out in their official duties. “[T]his legislation would put ‘soldiers of God’ above the law, allowing them to act as judge, jury, and executioner,” said Larry T. Decker, Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America. An article published on the same date by the Addicting Info web site provided a slightly less alarmist report: Mississippi Republicans are taking a “shoot first, ask questions later” approach to preventing potential church violence with a bill that amounts to legalizing religious “security” squads tasked with killing perceived threats. The state’s Republican-led senate passed the so-called “Mississippi Church Protection Act” which would militarize the state’s churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight . The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons. It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security. The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public … Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as “security” which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of “justifiable homicide” — the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty. Both sites linked to the Mississippi legislature’s House Bill 786, which does not include any wording referencing “soldiers of Christ” or “soldiers of God” anywhere in its text:  AN ACT TO CREATE THE “MISSISSIPPI CHURCH PROTECTION ACT”; TO AMEND SECTION 45-9-101, MISSISSIPPI CODE OF 1972, TO CONFORM TO THE PRECEDING SECTION; TO BRING FORWARD SECTION 97-37-7, MISSISSIPPI CODE OF 1972, FOR PURPOSES OF AMENDMENT; TO AMEND SECTION 97-37-9, MISSISSIPPI CODE OF 1972, TO REVISE THE LIST OF DEFENSES FOR A PERSON INDICTED OR CHARGED FOR A VIOLATION OF THE PROVISION OF LAW REGULATING THE USE OF FIREARMS; TO AMEND SECTION 97-3-15, MISSISSIPPI CODE OF 1972, TO PROVIDE THAT KILLING A PERSON WHILE ACTING AS A PARTICIPANT OF A CHURCH OR PLACE OF WORSHIP SECURITY TEAM IS JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE; AND FOR RELATED PURPOSES. While The Free Thought Project maintained that the bill “legally recognizes actual ‘soldiers of Christ’ and grants them the power to kill” and that “the state of Mississippi effectively recognizes churches as their own sovereign entities,” the actual text of the bill creates a legally codified way of assembling security details (with the participation of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety) who may possess concealed weapons in places (such as churches) that were previously off-limits to concealed carry:  The Mississippi concealed firearms law has been amended to allow licensed gun owners who have “additional” training to carry concealed firearms in certain locations previously prohibited by law. These locations include courthouses, polling places, government meetings, any school, college or professional athletic event, bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, any elementary or secondary school facility, any junior college, community college, college or university facility, inside the passenger terminal of any airport, and in any church or other place of worship. It’s possible that some readers misinterpreted the bill’s phrase “to provide that killing a person while acting as a participant of a church or place of worship security team” to mean “participant of a church” or “participant of a security team,” but the bill references only trained security team members acting under the direction of church officials. Such persons would be shielded from civil liability stemming from the performance of their duties: The governing body of any church or place of worship may establish a security program by which designated members are authorized to carry firearms for the protection of the congregation of such church or place of worship, including resisting any unlawful attempt to kill a member(s) or attendee(s) of such church or place of worship, or to commit any felony upon any such member or attendee in the church or place of worship or in the immediate premises thereof. Any church or place of worship that establishes a security program that meets the requirements of subsection (2) of this section and any participant of such security program shall be immune from civil liability for any action taken by a member of such security program, if such action occurs during the course and scope of the member’s performance of their official duties as a member of the security program for the church or place of worship. In order to be eligible for the immunity provided in this section, such program shall at a minimum:  (i) require each participant of the program to have a firearms permit issued under Section 45-9-101; and (ii) require each participant to complete an instructional course in the safe handling and use of firearms as described in Section 97-37-7. The Charleston church shooting in June 2015 appeared to be at least part of the impetus behind the introduction of the bill, as that specific incident was cited by a Mississippi lawmaker: Rep. Andy Gipson of Braxton says he authored the bill in response to a church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. He says the bill gives small churches and other houses of worship an extra option for security. While it is true the bill allows for armed security personnel to be present at church services, it isn’t aimed at allowing ordinary churchgoers to kill at will, nor does it specifically designate persons as “soldiers of God” or “soldiers of Christ” and grant them absolute legal immunity from prosecution for killing anyone during church services. Under the provisions of the bill, any person seeking legal protection from criminal prosecution for involvement in a fatal shooting committed during church services would still be subject to arrest and trial with the hope that a jury would agree his actions were justifiable.",1
"""Call it New England Politics 101. When you're running for office in Red Sox Nation, you don't take a Red Sox player's name in vain. Especially not the one who shed blood as he helped end that soul-crushing 86-year drought. But that's exactly what independent gubernatorial candidate Lincoln Chafee did in speaking about former Red Sox ace Curt Schilling in an interview on WPRO's The John DePetro show Tuesday. """"I just remember his own teammates didn't like him,"""" Chafee said of Schilling. """"They thought he was a bit of a salesman. I remember one of his teammates said he painted his sock, the bloody sock, that he painted it. Kevin Millar I think said that. I don't know if I trust Curt Schilling."""" He was talking about the larger issue of Schilling's role in a controversial state economic development deal that will give Schilling's video game company, 38 Studios, a $75-million loan guarantee if he moves it to Rhode Island from Massachusetts. Chafee criticized the Schilling agreement for encumbering more than half of a new state loan guarantee program and risking it """"on one company that's never had a penny of revenue yet."""" But what many will remember is that Chafee criticized the guy who got the Sox a win when they needed it most: Game 6 of the 2004 playoff series against the Yankees. Not to mention he maligned the sock that has since been enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Put it up there with failed Massachusetts Senate candidate Martha Coakley, who famously referred to Schilling as a Yankee fan and poked fun at her opponent, Scott Brown, for standing outside Fenway Park shaking hands. Diehard fans never forgave her. And Scott Brown is now Senator Brown. The Chafee camp was quick to retract the talk radio comment, sending The Providence Journal this statement by late morning: """"Senator Chafee regrets that what he intended as an off-hand reference to published reports about the bloody sock has deflected attention from the crux of this issue."""" He went on to say: """"Senator Chafee respects Curt Schilling's achievements as a professional athlete and his support of charitable causes. At the end of the day, however, his first concern is to protect the interest of Rhode Island taxpayers, on whose shoulders the burden of a 75 million dollar loan default would ultimately fall."""" We here at PolitiFact don't typically check one-time shots from the hip, so we considered ignoring this flap. But by Tuesday afternoon, as the Chafee gaffe made national news and readers urged us to jump on it, we decided to take at look at the rumor that's been swirling for years. It appears by all credible accounts that Chafee is, in fact, wrong. The story begins with an ankle injury Schilling suffered in a playoff series against the Angels. Team doctors temporarily fixed a ruptured and dislocated tendon in his right ankle to keep it from moving, allowing him to pitch in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the Yankees. Here's what The Providence Journal story about that October 2004 game said:  """"Schilling, who apparently was bleeding through his sock, was pitching through discomfort. TV cameras caught him wincing as he followed the flight of Miguel Cairo's two-out double to left-center in the third inning, the first Yankee hit of the game."""" Ah yes, it's coming back now, chills and all. You know the ending. Schilling kept pitching, helping  to vault the Sox past the Yankees to capture the American League title and then win the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Fast forward three years. The rumor that the blood on the sock was in fact red paint seems to have been started in 2007 by Baltimore Orioles TV announcer Gary Thorne, who said on air that Boston's then-backup catcher Doug Mirabelli told him it was a hoax. (That's Mirabelli, not Kevin Millar, as Chafee cited). Thorne later apologized, saying that Mirabelli told him in a later conversation that he was just joking. After much buzz on blogs and television, the report ended there. It's been brought up again from time to time, but never with much traction. We emailed Schilling Tuesday to get his reaction to the accusation, but we never heard back. For now, all indications are that the blood was real and that Chafee is wrong, a fact that he admits and apologizes for. In a follow-up phone call Tuesday night, a Chafee campaign spokesman said it best: """"Some candidates shoot themselves in the foot. We shot ourselves in the sock."""" The Truth-O-Meter gives Chafee a , and scores him a big error in the public relations department.""",1
"Also known as rebounding, it delivers a low-impact, calorie-burning workout that swaps the tedium of a treadmill or step class for a feeling of child-like euphoria. At Chelsea Piers Connecticut, an adult fitness class twins trampolining with rock climbing. “I wanted to do something fun. Everybody likes to climb as kids, everybody loves the bounce of the trampoline,” said Byron Knox, a director and instructor at the Stamford-based facility. No stranger to odd fitness combinations, Knox, who also coaches football and gymnastics, said the hybrid class works well. “The trampoline is predominantly leg-based, although we do core exercises on it. The rock climbing is predominantly upper body, although you do use your legs,” he said. Knox compared it to working a leg press followed by using upper body equipment, but said it is more entertaining. “Most people wouldn’t think of trampoline as a workout but it takes a lot of energy,” he said. “It could be equal (in cardiovascular intensity) to jumping rope. And part of the beauty is that the exerciser is in control.”  The more flexible can jump and split-jump higher, but Knox said just about anybody can participate, and trampolining also enhances balance and spatial awareness. At Chelsea Piers Connecticut the “tramp” precedes the rock wall. “That part takes a bit more coaxing,” Knox admits, although everyone is harnessed and spotted. At JumpLife studio in New York City, some 25 mini-trampolines connect with low lights and top 100 songs to draw out the inner dancer. “JumpDance is our signature class,” said founder and CEO Montserrat Markou, of the 45-minute non-stop cardio workout, which she said can burn up to 600 calories. She said the class doubles as a venue for bachelorette parties and girls’ nights out. “The low lights make people less self-conscious,” Markou said. Another class, called JumpGym, ditches the dance club vibe and incorporates weights and push-ups into the trampoline workout. “JumpGym attracts more men,” said Markou, whose mini-trampolines are equipped with a handlebar that can be grabbed should balance fail. “People can work out who couldn’t work out before,” said Markou, who hopes to draw in seniors and children. Rebounding classes at Crunch fitness centers pair mini-trampolines with sculpt, Pilates and interval classes. Group fitness manager Carol Johnson likens the bouncing motion to getting a massage. “It’s a bit more gentle on the body, more rehabilitative,” said Johnson, who’s been rebounding for about 10 years. Jessica Matthews, an exercise physiologist with the American Council on Exercise, said trampolining is a joint-friendly way to add the cardiovascular component to a group fitness workout. The intensity, she said, can vary from a brisk walk to a run. She said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has used trampolines to build bone density in astronauts. Matthews cautions that while the impact is low, the surface of a trampoline is still unstable and cautioned that people who have lower-extremity instability must be aware of this. She said people also combine it with other activities. “Some do it while watching TV,” she added.",0
"Cost plays an important role in this story, as the drug (should it come to market) would be expensive and there is considerable uncertainty about whether insurance would pay for it. Most of the “benefit” information in this story is provided by the mother of the three boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who reflects in detail on a level of activity among her sons that she feels demonstrates the drug’s effectiveness. The reporter reflects briefly on clinical trial results that offered “some slight positive results,” but we never learn what those are. The text briefly mentions side effects associated with the drug, increases in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, an assertion contested by the drug’s manufacturer, PTC Therapeutics. However, it would have been more helpful to quantify and more clearly describe these side effects, and tap independent experts for their viewpoints. We found the NCHR’s testimony about the risks of combining this drug with other drugs these kids commonly take to be important, for example. On the one hand, the story does a good job of making the point that clinical trial results are murky, leading the National Center for Health Research to recommend that the FDA vote “no” on approving the drug. But on the other, the text makes no effort to help readers understand the nature of the evidence on which such a decision would be based. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a killer. Quite a few sources were interviewed for the story. And, all sources are clearly identified, including the CEO of the company that is apparently funding the clinical trials. However, we do think the story would have been stronger had it tapped the viewpoints of an expert in muscular dystrophy who has no vested interested in the drug receiving approval. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The story does devote some space to another drug, Exondys 51, which has been approved by the FDA, but the text is clear that the type of DMD that afflicts the three boys is not responsive to that drug. A main point of narrative tension in the story is the family’s wait to see if the FDA will approve the drug. So it is clear that the drug is not yet available. The story makes it clear that this drug is unique, in that it aims to override the specific genetic mutations causing this type of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The story clearly does not rely on a news release.",0
"President Donald Trump and some of his supporters have frequently talked up the alleged threat posed by undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border of the United States. Arguing in support of his long-promised border wall, President Trump, for example, has claimed that “Sixty-three thousand Americans since 9/11 have been killed by illegal aliens,” a claim we have previously found to be false. In reality, repeated studies have shown that undocumented immigrants in the United States actually commit crime, including violent crime, at a lower rate than citizens of the United States. This clash between the “violent illegals” rhetoric of right-leaning supporters of President Trump’s proposed border wall and the empirical reality has given rise to a series of statistical counter-claims, especially popular among left-leaning opponents of Trump on social media. For example, we have previously examined the veracity of a viral meme that claimed lack of access to affordable health care was responsible for a greater number of deaths than terrorism and homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants combined. In January 2019, several weeks into the federal government shutdown prompted by a dispute between President Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding the proposed border wall, another eye-catching statistical comparison gained popularity on social media: “Lettuce killed more Americans [in 2018] than undocumented immigrants.”  Last year lettuce killed more Americans than undocumented immigrants so it’s a good thing we’re halting food inspections over a wall that won’t work. — Ally Maynard (@missmayn) January 10, 2019   Despite the grammatical ambiguity in these claims, it’s clear the assertion being made was that in 2018, a greater number of deaths resulted from the consumption of tainted lettuce than from homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two multi-state outbreaks of the E.coli bacterium occurred in 2018 involving lettuce. The first outbreak ended in June and led to five deaths as well as hospitalization of 96 people, 27 of whom developed a kind of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can be life-threatening, but according to the World Health Organization, only 3 to 5 percent of people who develop HUS die during the course of the disease, although that rate is higher among young children and the elderly. The second outbreak began in October and appeared to have ended by December, leading to 62 cases of infection, 25 hospitalizations (including two cases of HUS), but no deaths. So in total, the CDC documented a total of five deaths from consuming tainted lettuce in 2018. No official nationwide tally of the number of homicides committed by undocumented immigrants is kept, so those figures are less clear. However, we do have some useful data which we have previously examined in greater detail. In 2018, the Cato Institute published a report that used official Texas Department of Public Safety data and found that in 2015, undocumented immigrants were convicted of 46 homicides in the state of Texas, a rate of 2.6 convictions per 100,000 undocumented immigrants (a lower homicide conviction rate than among U.S. citizens in Texas). The author of the report stipulated that, “The conviction and arrest rates for the entire period of January 1, 2011, through November 15, 2017, are nearly identical to those of 2015, so the choice of year makes little difference.” Assuming that there was no sudden and drastic change in the figures between 2011-2017 and 2018, the findings for 2015 are a reasonable proxy for homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants in 2018. Further, we know that an estimated 10.7 million undocumented immigrants lived in the United States in 2016. If the rate of homicide conviction seen in Texas was the same as the nationwide rate, this would work out to be around 278 homicide convictions of undocumented immigrants throughout the United States in 2016, and a similar number in 2018. (The estimated undocumented immigrant population of the U.S. has been declining in recent years, from 12.2 million in 2007 to 10.7 million in 2016, or roughly .16 annually. If that trend continued and the number fell to around 10.4 in 2018, that would still equate to an estimated 273 homicide convictions that year.) It’s true that these figures relate to homicide convictions, and not, strictly speaking, homicides. However, for every murder that took place in 2016 but didn’t culminate in a conviction until 2018, it’s reasonable to assume that there was another murder that took place in 2018 but won’t culminate in a conviction until 2020. In other words, the number of homicide convictions in any given year will not be significantly different from the number of prosecutable homicides in that same year. Whatever the exact number of homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants in 2018 was (and there is a reasonable statistical basis to estimate it was around 270), it is safe to say that it was a vastly higher figure than the mere five deaths the CDC recorded as being caused by lettuce tainted with E.coli. If one takes a step back from the criminal justice system for a moment, one can view the “lettuce-vs.-undocumented-immigrants” comparison in another light. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of homicides recorded by the CDC increased each year from 15,872 to 19,362, so it may be reasonable to estimate around 20,000 homicides took place in 2018. In order for the number of homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants to be lower than the number of lettuce-related deaths (five), it would require that undocumented immigrants commit only 0.02 percent of homicides, despite making up more than 3 percent of the total U.S. population. That is, undocumented immigrants would need to have accounted for a share of homicides that was 165 times lower than their proportion of the U.S. population. We know from the Texas data that undocumented immigrants do account for a lower share of homicide convictions (5.9 percent) than their share of the population (6.4 percent) — but not 165 times lower. Despite the absence of official nationwide data on homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants, we have more than enough robust data to conclude that the claim lettuce killed more people in the United States in 2018 than undocumented immigrants did is false.",1
"The website reveals that the materials for this diet plan cost almost $50, including shipping. This price should have been included in the release. The news release says that the diet is based on common food items, implying the food cost wouldn”t be substantially more expensive than the dieter’s regular diet. However, this impression cannot be checked without reviewing the plan materials. The release merely says “it works.” The release notes that the author lost 70 pounds 12 years ago, although it appears that his personal weight loss was the result of applying techniques discussed in an earlier book, not the specific methods pitched in this release. And, while Lou Piniella is trotted out of the bullpen to impress with his name, no data about his results are provided in the news release. It is important to note that while the release claims that “The Baseball Diet” will produce results within nine weeks, in order to improve health a diet plan must help people maintain lower weight indefinitely. There is no discussion of potential harms. The release asserts that, “”The more simple and realistic a diet is, the more likely that you will form new habits.”” But there is no evidence provided to support this statement or that this diet plan actually helps buyers “form new habits.” OK, they got one batter out here — one Satisfactory rating. Weight loss is indeed recommended for most Americans, and as the release states, it is indeed difficult, with most diet plans failing to deliver long term benefits. While readers can reasonably assume that the author of the materials will be paid a share of the sales proceeds, the release should have specifically disclosed whether the celebrity quoted in the release (Lou Pinella) was paid for his endorsement. There is no specific comparison to other weight loss programs or other approaches that might be beneficial for weight loss. It”s clear that “The Baseball Diet” materials are for sale now. A link to the product web site is included. The release makes vague statements meant to distinguish this program from other weight loss approaches, saying it is generally simpler and more fun. However, nothing is presented that shows this approach is novel. Easy, fun, competitive (? ), will help anyone look good and feel great – all without data or any supporting information other than two anecdotes, at least one of which is heavily conflicted.",1
"The article didn’t discuss any differences in the financial cost of the two approaches. Nor did it discuss whether insurers are likely to curtail coverage based on the new findings. The story presented a brief quantification of the overall survival rate but would have been improved by using numbers of breast cancer patients who might be affected. The story presented a clear statement regarding the lack of long-term evidence. However, it did not clearly quantify the potential harms of sentinel node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection and compare them. How often do complications occur? The story was specific about study population and the current and possible future effects on clinical practice. However, it didn’t address the fact that recruitment was stopped early because it would have taken 20 years to get the 500 deaths required to fully power the analyses, given that overall survival was so much higher than expected. The researchers were quite clear in their published manuscript about the possible limitations in their study. There was no evidence of disease-mongering in this story. The story identifies its journal source, and includes interviews with several independent clinical sources, as well as a statement from the Chief Medical Officer of the American Cancer Society. It did explain the NCI funding for the trial. The article briefly mentions standard-of-care treatment and how that might be affected by this study. The article appropriately defines to whom these findings would apply and briefly indicates not all physicians would be likely to adopt the findings immediately. The article uses helpful quotes from breast cancer experts to establish the significant effect of this new information on clinical practice. The story does not rely solely on a news release.",0
"""Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner is attacking GOP opponent George LeMieux by invoking two names likely to displease conservative primary voters. Barack Obama and Charlie Crist. In an Internet ad released June 10, 2011, Hasner tries to link LeMieux to Crist -- the former governor who left the GOP while trying to win a Senate seat in 2010. Marco Rubio, a former House speaker who served as a state legislator from 2000 to 2008 and is now a national Republican star, won that seat. The ad shows a photo of Crist and then states:  Defended President Obama's Stimulus As """"Helpful to Florida"""" Fought For Taxpayer Funded Bailout Of Big Sugar  Architect Of Obama-Style Cap And Trade Plan For Florida  Falsely Attacked Marco Rubio  Even Compared Marco Rubio To Barack Obama  Charlie Crist -- Right? Wrong. As the word """"wrong"""" appears, the camera zooms out on the picture of Crist. There is LeMieux, whispering in Crist's ear. The ad finishes -- """"Get to know the Real George LeMieux."""" The goal of the message is clear enough: Paint a portrait of LeMieux -- Crist's former chief of staff who was later appointed by Crist to serve in the U.S. Senate -- as an Obama-loving Crist buddy who criticized Florida's GOP superstar, Rubio. But is it accurate? For this Truth-O-Meter item we will examine the claim Hasner made that LeMieux """"even compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama."""" In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we're checking another claim that LeMieux """"falsely attacked Marco Rubio."""" Hasner's ad cited a Nov. 17, 2009, St. Petersburg Times article as the source for LeMieux comparing Rubio to Obama. Back then, LeMieux was supporting Crist over Rubio. And back then, Crist was still running as a Republican. LeMieux critiqued Rubio in an item posted to the Times' online blog, The Buzz. From The Buzz: """"Being governor means you have to make choices. And you have to make decisions,"""" LeMieux said, heading into a GOP lunch at the U.S. Capitol. """"It's very easy to be a critic and the speaker now is not in office. He wasn't there when the state was facing the challenges of the huge recession and the stimulus. He didn't have to vote on that. All of the folks that were in his administration voted for the stimulus money. And I suspect if he were there, he could vote for it. This is just like President Obama being able to be against the war in Iraq because he didn't have to vote on it. There's a lot of parallels to draw between Speaker Rubio and President Obama in the way they are running their race and in their ability to throw bombs without ever having to lead because they are out of office."""" LeMieux was arguing that it was easy for Rubio, who left the Legislature in 2008, to criticize Crist for taking stimulus money when Rubio was no longer in the Legislature -- just like it was easy for Obama to oppose going to war against Iraq because he wasn't in the U.S. Senate or White House then. (Obama was in the Illinois Legislature when Operation Iraqi Freedom was launched in 2003.) LeMieux isn't comparing Rubio and Obama on a stance or an issue here (like they both supported cap-and-trade, or something like that). He is making a general point that it's easy for candidates to later oppose something they didn't have to vote on. None of that is made clear in the ad. But that's not the only problem when considering this claim. """"George endorsed Marco the day after Charlie left the Republican Party and aggressively campaigned for Marco in the General Election,"""" LeMieux campaign manager Brian Seitchik e-mailed us June 13. LeMieux hosted a fundraiser for Rubio, campaigned with him and introduced him at events, Seitchik wrote. (Note: Crist left the GOP on April 29. The next day LeMieux issued this statement: """"I am saddened that my friend, Governor Crist, has decided to leave the Republican Party. Our friendship runs deep, but my commitment to the principles of the Republican Party runs deeper. I cannot walk down the path he has chosen. ... I will support our Republican nominee and will continue to do everything I can both in Florida and across the country to increase the number of Republicans in the United States Senate."""" A formal endorsement of Rubio didn't come until July, however, according to The Hill which cited the conservative blog, The Shark Tank.) There are other examples of LeMieux supporting Rubio. On July 12, 2010, The Buzz reported that LeMieux's PAC gave $2,400 to Rubio's campaign. The conservative blog the Shark Tank reported on the same day that LeMieux endorsed Rubio -- see a video of LeMieux here calling Rubio a """"good conservative candidate."""" And LeMieux campaigned for Rubio at a few Central Florida stops -- including The Villages retirement community -- the Palm Beach Post reported Oct 7. At one of events, LeMieux called Rubio '""""the brightest star of our generation in politics — and not just in Florida, nationwide,'"""" the Post wrote. Lastly, we have to point out that simply comparing Rubio, a Republican, to Obama, a Democrat, doesn't have to be a bad thing. The New Republic, for instance, called Rubio the """"Republican Obama"""" in a February 2010 article. And a national conservative figure, Richard Land, was quoted in 2010 talking up a Rubio run for president in 2012, noting that Rubio would have """"more experience than Obama had"""" when Obama ran for president. (PolitiFact Florida rated that claim Barely True.) On the whole, this claim is puzzling. Let's again look at the text of the ad, which starts by linking LeMieux to three issues -- the federal stimulus package, Big Sugar and cap and trade. Then the ad abruptly switches to general statements about Rubio saying that LeMieux falsely attacked Rubio and """"compared Rubio to Barack Obama."""" LeMieux didn't compare Rubio and Obama on an issue such as those listed at the start of the ad -- he said they both used a familiar campaign tactic, throwing """"bombs"""" about something they didn't have to vote on themselves. The ad provides no explanation for how he compared the two politicians and neglects to note that LeMieux supported Rubio's campaign once Crist left the GOP. We rate this statement Barely True.""",1
"""Weed, pot, ganja, sticky icky, cannabis. Call it what you want, some statewide advocates want it called legal. It was more than a month before 4/20 (Weed) Day, but supporters for legalizing marijuana were out in Atlanta recently making their case to rewrite the state’s marijuana laws.Georgia has spent billions of tax dollars enforcing """"draconian"""" and ineffective prohibition laws against marijuana, the supporters said during Cannabis Awareness Day at the state Capitol. """"In Georgia, more than 35,000 arrests occur for marijuana offenses each year. Eighty-five percent of those arrests are for possession, accounting for 55 percent of all drug arrests,"""" James Bell, the director of Georgia C.A.R.E. (Campaign for Access, Reform and Education), said in a news release. """"Today, March 14, about 100 people will be arrested for possession of marijuana in Georgia."""" PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether that many people are actually being arrested each day. For decades marijuana has been one of the most popular drugs in the nation, even for the most famous among us. Former President Bill Clinton admitted to smoking -- although not inhaling -- it while in college. And President Barack Obama supposedly ran around his high school with the Choom Gang of marijuana-smoking buddies. In November, voters in Colorado and Washington state approved legislation legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The drug is already legal for medical use in 18 states. But marijuana remains illegal under federal laws, although Obama has said federal law enforcers have """"bigger fish to fry"""" than chasing down marijuana users. Georgia prosecutes marijuana offenses under its Controlled Substances Act, and it has various fines and punishments for growing, buying, selling and possessing the drug. (Georgia also passed its own medical marijuana law in 1980, but the law has never been implemented.) Bell said his numbers are derived from estimates of FBI arrest data for the state of Georgia. Doing the math on his claim, 85 percent of the 35,000 annual arrests would equal 29,750 arrests for marijuana possession. Dividing that number by 365 days, equals about 81.5 possession arrests each day. """"We’re fed up with the whole war on drugs,"""" he said. His group wanted state lawmakers to consider revising the marijuana laws as part of criminal justice reform, but none of them sponsored any legislation. We reviewed FBI crime data and found that marijuana accounted for 52.1 percent of all arrests for drug abuse violations nationwide in 2010. And 45.8 percent of those marijuana arrests were for possession. That marijuana arrests figure dropped a bit to 49.5 percent in 2011, with 43.3 percent of those marijuana arrests being for possession. Marijuana policy researcher Jon Gettman forwarded to PolitiFact data he compiled from FBI data on the same subject. According  to that data, Georgia’s marijuana arrests were:   Year        All marijuana arrests        Marijuana possession arrests  2008            30,289                    26,978 2009            33,200                    28,892 2010            31,506                    28,091  Gettman, a criminal justice professor at Shenandoah University, has also been a past president and national director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. But calculating arrests is a tricky undertaking, Robert Friedmann, a criminology professor at Georgia State University, reminds us. Arrest numbers are nebulous, he said, depending on the way they are counted: Are multiple arrests for a single person counted individually? Do the numbers include local, state and federal activities? Do all jurisdictions report arrests? An explanation of arrest data on the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program states that the report counts one arrest for each separate instance in which a person is arrested, cited or summoned for an offense. Because a person can be arrested multiple times, the FBI report doesn’t reflect the number of people who have been arrested, but the number of times people are arrested. So what’s the skinny? Marijuana legalization advocate James Bell said about 100 Georgians are arrested each day on charges of marijuana possession. Bell’s claim is based on FBI crime report arrest data. Using that data from the years 2008 through 2010, an average of about 28,000 possession arrests were recorded in Georgia each year. Dividing the average annual possession arrests by 365 days results in about 76.7 marijuana possession arrests each day. Bell uses that arrest data to estimate the number of people arrested for the violation. But the FBI clearly states this type of estimation that Bell claims is not reflected in their numbers. Individuals can be arrested multiple times for the same infraction, so the FBI’s arrest data indicate the number of arrests -- not the number of people arrested -- for any particular infraction. Based on this explanation, Bell’s claim seems to be up in smoke. We rated Bell’s claim .""",1
"Dozens of child advocates, public policy experts and doctors gathered to brainstorm ideas for first lady Michelle Obama’s campaign to wipe out childhood obesity in a generation. An interagency task force reviewing U.S. programs and policies on child nutrition and physical activity is due to report to President Barack Obama within the next month. The summit participants were asked to come up with three to five recommendations for the task force to consider taking to the president. Healthier foods in corporate cafeterias and linking public transportation to grocery store access were among the early suggestions. But the audience especially appeared to appreciate a California doctor’s call for a drive to integrate short bursts of physical activity into the regular workplace and school routine. “We have great meetings with lots of healthy refreshments now, compared to 20 years ago when we would only have unhealthy refreshments, or 30 years ago when people would have been smoking in this room,” said Dr. Toni Yancey of University of California Los Angeles. “Now we need to not coop people up for hours on end without physical activity,” Yancey continued as laughter erupted from colleagues in the windowless auditorium. The experts’ advice and guidance would help the task force develop measurable benchmarks for fighting childhood obesity, Michelle Obama said at the start of the session. The United States spends $150 billion a year to treat obesity-related conditions. The costs are projected to almost double over the next decade and will account for a fifth of overall healthcare spending, White House budget director Peter Orszag said. Besides direct healthcare costs and lost productivity, Orszag said the magnitude of obesity-associated health risk may not be fully appreciated. “Having a body mass index in the obesity range is equivalent to aging 20 years in terms of the chronic conditions that you face,” Orszag said. “So, 40 may be the new 30, but if you’re obese, unfortunately, 40’s the new 60.”",0
"""Planned Parenthood is not involved in women’s health issues, said Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. At a town hall in Englewood, Colo., Aug. 25, an audience member asked Bush about his record on women’s health, as well as what he would do for women’s health, particularly for veterans, as president. """"When I was governor, we expanded those programs through community-based organizations, and that’s something I think the federal government needs to continue to do,"""" Bush said. """"I, for one, don’t think Planned Parenthood ought to get a penny, though. And that’s the difference because they’re not actually doing women’s health issues. They're involved in something way different than that."""" Bush, who cut off state funding for Planned Parenthood as governor, then pivoted to talk about veterans affairs. Bush’s claim that the organization is not involved in women’s health caught our attention. Setting aside the issue of abortion, Planned Parenthood offers many other medical services -- most of which seem obviously related to women’s health. We reached out to Bush’s campaign, and it directed us to a tweet that Bush posted, after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized his Aug. 25 remarks. Bush’s tweet said, """"PP (Planned Parenthood) treatment of unborn has been horrifying. Let's support quality women's health programs instead."""" The National Library of Medicine defines """"women’s health"""" as """"the branch of medicine that focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being."""" While """"women’s health"""" encompasses all health issues as they pertain to women, reproductive health in particular is Planned Parenthood’s primary focus. The organization offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams. (No, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, but it conducts breast exams and refers women to other clinics for mammograms.) In total, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, and it provided nearly 11 million services, according to its most recent annual report. About 12 percent of patients received an abortion, (assuming one procedure per abortion patient), so the remaining 88 percent of patients received other health services. Here’s the section of the report breaking down services provided in 2013:  Our friends at the Washington Post's Fact Checker also looked at Bush's claim and gave it four pinocchios, their lowest rating. Our ruling Bush said, Planned Parenthood is """"not actually doing women’s health issues."""" It’s hard to reconcile Bush’s statement with the fact that -- setting abortion procedures aside -- Planned Parenthood offered more than 10 million services in 2013. Those services included contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests and STI testing and treatment. Bush is opposed to abortion, but it doesn’t make sense to say that Planned Parenthood isn’t addressing women’s health issues. We rate Bush’s claim .""",1
"""As the pundits look ahead to 2015, they know that time is running out for the United States to reach a permanent deal with Iran over its nuclear program. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until mid March to come to terms on a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Iran’s stock of enriched uranium and freezes the country’s capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. On Fox News Sunday Dec. 28, 2014, Stephen Hayes of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine spoke skeptically about what lies ahead. Hayes believes a final deal is likely, but he doubts the Obama administration will drive a hard bargain. """"They want the deal for the sake of having the deal,"""" Hayes said. """"We basically caught -- we've caught Iran cheating on the interim deal and rather than saying, ‘Look, we're done, you've proven that you're not an effective partner, that we can't trust you,’ they say, ‘We'll give you more time because we're going to get to a deal.’ """" We decided to check whether Iran was caught cheating on the interim agreement. Hayes told us he had two violations in mind. The one most tightly tied to Iran’s nuclear program had to do with Iran’s work with a new model of centrifuge. Centrifuges are key to enriching uranium and enriched uranium is key to making a bomb. The other violation had to do with Iran selling more oil than it is allowed. In our research, we found a third possible violation involving Iran buying parts for its heavy water reactor in Arak. What we discovered is that while Iran isn’t squeaky clean, no point is definitively in violation of the interim agreement. Importantly, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. We’ll deal with each potential violation in turn. Work with a new model of centrifuge One of the pillars of the interim agreement, the Joint Plan of Action, was to freeze Iran’s centrifuge facilities. It could keep the tens of thousands of centrifuges it has and could repair any that were broken, but it couldn’t expand its capacity. As part of the agreement, Iran could continue some limited research and development work. A problem emerged in November when the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that in the """"R&D area,"""" Iran """"has been intermittently feeding natural UF6 (uranium fluoride) into the IR-5 centrifuge."""" Agency inspectors said that no enriched uranium emerged because the Iranians recombined everything back together at the end of the run. This set off red flags because, until then, the Iranians had not fed uranium fluoride into that particular centrifuge. """"Iran was caught red-handed engaged in centrifuge activities,"""" Hayes said. """"When confronted by the State Department, Iran stopped feeding the IR-5."""" Hayes relied on an assessment from the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. In November, the institute initially said, """"The feeding of the IR-5 centrifuge is an apparent violation of that commitment to freeze centrifuge R&D activities."""" Hayes told us that he took an """"apparent violation"""" to be the equivalent of cheating. But David Albright, the institute’s president, said that after a closer look, it wasn’t that cut and dried. """"It’s hard to say definitively one way or the other on the question of a clear violation,"""" Albright told PunditFact. Albright and his group’s latest assessment is that the Joint Plan of Action didn’t specifically allow the Iranians to feed the uranium into the IR-5 centrifuge. But it’s not clear if that constitutes a violation. Albright said that an administration official told him that the action was """"inconsistent with the United States’ understanding of the Joint Plan of Action."""" That could be a diplomatic way of saying there had been a violation, or it might mean that the original agreement was unclear, a lawyer told Albright. What is clear: The Americans asked Iran to stop, and Iran did. Adam Mount, a nuclear security fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said as far as anyone can tell, the interim agreement has achieved what it set out to do. """"There is no publicly available evidence that Iran has violated the terms of the Joint Plan of Action,"""" Mount said. """"Progress on the Iranian nuclear program is frozen and in some of the most important areas, it has been rolled back."""" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that hopes to see a final nuclear agreement with Iran, said it would have been better if Iran hadn’t fed the uranium into the IR-5 centrifuge. """"Was it useful or helpful?"""" Kimball asked. """"No. Was it specifically prohibited by the Joint Plan of Action? Also no. There is a big difference between the Iranians have been caught cheating, and a dispute about the one centrifuge."""" In sum, the weight of the evidence says that it would have been better if Iran had not fired up that IR-5 centrifuge, but doing so didn’t rise to the level of violating the interim agreement. Iran sold too much oil Hayes’ second contention is that Iran sold more oil than allowed as part of the interim agreement. """"Iran violated the terms of the Joint Plan of Action by exporting more crude than the agreement allowed, specifically to China, India, Japan and South Korea,"""" Hayes told us. For evidence, Hayes pointed us to a Reuters article that reported that in the first nine months of 2014, sales to those countries had risen nearly 20 percent from the year before, to about 1.14 million barrels per day. But again, things aren’t so cut and dried. The Joint Plan of Action says that the five Security Council countries and Germany would stop trying to reduce the amount of oil that Iran could sell. It also says that countries can continue to buy """"their current average amounts of crude oil."""" There are no specific caps, however, and no clear explanation of what would constitute a violation. We spoke to Mark Dubowitz, who is executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group that monitors enforcement of sanctions against Iran. Dubowitz said he believes both Iran and the countries that bought its oil skirted the deal. But ultimately, Dubowitz said we can’t know for sure whether Iran’s oil sales violate the terms of the agreement because we lack access to a critical piece. Behind the public summary of the Joint Plan of Action is a much more detailed implementation agreement. Only people with a certain level of security clearance can see it. """"We don’t know what that says,"""" Dubowitz said. """"Iran’s sales might be a violation. Or they might not."""" Also, several of the countries that are buying Iran’s oil, such as India, Japan and South Korea, didn’t sign the interim agreement and thus wouldn’t be bound by it. And lastly, while the United States has set limits on the amount of oil Iran can sell, those are not written into the Joint Plan of Action. Buying parts for a heavy water reactor Some analysts we reached thought Hayes might have been thinking of another potential problem with Iran. According to some reports, it has continued to buy parts that could be used in its heavy water reactor, which is another means to produce fuel for a nuclear bomb. However, even if those reports are accurate, the activity falls outside the interim agreement. Matthew Kroenig is a professor of international relations at Georgetown University. Kroenig would not call these purchases a violation of the Joint Plan of Action. On the other hand, Kroenig said that shouldn’t make anyone feel any better. """"It is in violation of U.N. sanctions prohibiting Iranian procurement of sensitive nuclear technology,"""" Kroenig said. """"It also might reveal something about how sincere Iran is about shutting down or converting the reactor as part of a final deal."""" Our ruling Hayes said Iran had been caught cheating on the interim deal to rein in Iran’s nuclear program, called the Joint Plan of Action. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. That said, there are some actions by Iran that certainly cut near the boundaries of the terms of the agreement. Iran has worked with a new kind of centrifuge that, while perhaps not a formal violation, does seem to contradict the United States’ understanding of the deal, an expert told us. When confronted on the matter, Iran stopped its work. Also, there is some question about the amount of oil Iran is exporting. But an expert said we just don’t have enough information to determine whether that constitutes a violation of the agreement or not. Hayes said we caught Iran cheating. You can say some allege that, and you can say there’s some evidence that might suggest that. But we found no hand in the cookie jar. Consider helping fund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.""",1
"There was no information about the cost of treatment, though, again, knowledge about this product, including its cost, is widespread. The story stated that “people who took a low dose of aspirin every day for several years reduced their risk of developing Alzheimer’s by 13 percent.”  However the study itself reported that use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significant reduction in Alzheimer’s disease. Thus the story did not accurately report on these results and compounded this with its concluding statement. The story only listed stomach bleeding and ulcers as side effects of aspirin. The story also failed to include information about often it occurs. However as this is a story about prevention of Alzheimer’s disease, it should have mentioned that the bleeding risks associated with aspirin use increase with age. The evidence presented in this story was confusing. Although the most recent research was a randomized clincial trial, the writer chose to disregard these results in favor of epidemiologic study which found that HIGH doses of aspirin were associated with a statistically lower prevelance of Alzheimer’s disease. This study found no significant association with low dose aspirin; further, the conclusion reads as follows:  “Aspirin might protect against Alzheimer’s disease, but controlled trials are warranted.”  So it is presumptuous for the journalist to conclude “Regular aspirin use may lower the risk of Alzheimer’s.” There was no overt disease mongering in this story. This story did not appear to contain material obtained from individuals with expertise in this area. No one was quoted. There was no discussion of any other approaches under investigation for prevention or delay of Alzheimer’s disease. Although the story did not explicitly state that low-dose aspirin is a readily available, over-the-counter product, this information is common knowledge. The story accurately explained that studies examining whether aspirin can reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease have been conducted over a period of time. This story appears to have drawn on the results from different research studies and does not appear to rely exclusively on a press release.",1
"The ruling party’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported on Friday the recent launch of the “Treatment Tourism Exchange Corporation”, aimed at capitalizing on the “rising demand for tourism, including medical care, in line with an international trend”. The new state entity will operate health clinics near hot springs, whose mineral waters, it said, can help treat neuralgia, arthritis, and heart and skin ailments. Private tourism is one of the few remaining areas of business not blocked by sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. As many as 350,000 Chinese tourists have visited North Korea this year, potentially netting the authorities up to $175 million, according to some analysts. Last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a hot spring resort nearing completion in the central alpine town of Yangdok, one of major construction projects at the heart of his drive to build a “self-reliant” economy. Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies in Seoul, described the medical tourism campaign as propaganda designed at showing progress, while adding that it could appeal to some Chinese tourists. “North Korea primarily offers natural tourist attractions and appears to believe they can be a money maker if combined with elements of oriental medicine, which many Chinese people like,” he said. A recent report by a government-affiliated health institute in neighboring South Korea said North Korea was struggling to provide basic health care. “The reality is that primary-care providers — local clinics and doctors — are so short of basic equipment and supplies that they barely provide what may be called medical consultation,” it concluded in the report on the state of the health sector in the North. “The situation is not much better for secondary-care providers including state hospitals in cities and counties,” it said.",0
"On 15 December 2016, multiple web sites reported that a new Russian reality show called Game 2: Winter would allow rape and murder while contestants were participating in Siberia:  Readers who spotted the article floating around on social media often missed a less visible, slightly contradictory sub-heading that said:  Contestants sign waiver acknowledging they may not survive nine-month Siberian wilderness challenge, and if crimes are committed, [contestants] will be arrested[.] The article described the waiver, but reiterated that all crimes committed in the course of the show were prosecutable: “Each contestant gives consent that they could be maimed, even killed,” reads an advert. “2000 cameras, 900 hectares and 30 lives. Everything is allowed. Fighting, alcohol, murder, rape, smoking, anything.” Contestants will each sign a waiver acknowledging that they might be raped or killed but the rules also state that police are free to arrest anyone who commits a crime on the show. “You must understand that the police will come and take you away,” the rules state. “We are on the territory of Russia, and obey the laws of the Russian Federation.” Deadline provided further details about the show, which was purportedly in production as of December 2016: Envisioned as an online series to begin on July 1 next year and run through April 1, 2018 it will be screened 24/7 around the world. It’s the brainchild of entrepreneur Yevgeny Pyatkovsky who created and is financing the show. Per reports, he is investing 1B rubles ($16.2M) in the series which will air in English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese and Arabic. The official ad for the show says “Each contestant gives consent that they could be maimed, even killed. 2000 cameras, 900 hectares and 30 lives.” The rules say “Everything is allowed. Fighting, alcohol, murder, rape, smoking, anything.” In an interview last month, Pyatkovsky said all potential contestants sign waivers, acknowledging that they could be raped or killed. As of November 18, he said there were already 32 people who had signed up, including one American. A few days later, the list of applicants had reached 60. The Siberian Times‘s coverage of the planned Russian reality show cited a 1 July 2017 start date for pre-filming activity, and was the likely source of inaccurate rumors: The contest called ‘Game2: Winter’ is the brainchild of Novosibirsk entrepreneur Yevgeny Pyatkovsky, who said: ‘We will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped. ‘We will have nothing to do with this. This will be spelt out in a document to be signed by the participant before the start of the show.’ He said: ‘There have been no reality TV projects before that stay on air 24/7. ‘Probably all of you have watched the Lost TV series, but surviving in a tropical climate is quite different from trying to stay alive in the Siberian taiga – boreal forest – at minus 40 degrees Celsius.",1
"""With conservative Marco Rubio nipping at his heels in the race for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is trying to pump up his conservative credentials. In a new radio advertisement for his campaign, he says, """"Here in Florida, I’ve slashed government by 10 percent. That’s $7 billion."""" It’s a statement Crist has also made on the campaign trail, and at a Hillsborough County Republican Party fundraiser earlier this month. It’s true that Florida’s budget has dropped by 10 percent, or about $7 billion, since Crist was elected governor in November 2006. The budget passed by the Legislature and approved by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in May 2006 came in at $73.9 billion. This year’s spending plan tops out at $66.5 billion. But can Crist, as his radio ad claims, really take credit for the cuts? In 2007, Crist did veto $459 million from the state budget, setting a state record with his veto pen. But the Florida Constitution requires that state lawmakers prepare a balanced budget, which is built around revenue generated by sales taxes, corporate taxes, other taxes and fees, and federal appropriations. And since 2007, that revenue has declined significantly as the nationwide recession has taken hold. State budget documents show that in the 2006-2007 fiscal year, $31.7 billion was available in the general revenue fund. This year, the fund had only $21.9 billion. (In fiscal year 2007, the fund had $28 billion, and in 2008, it had $24.3 billion.) With revenue down and a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget, Crist had to either cut spending or raise taxes. """"This is not a concerted effort on the part of our governor and Legislature to cut the budget,"""" said Dominic M. Calabro, president and CEO of Florida TaxWatch. """"It is because of the worst economy Florida has had since the Great Depression."""" Crist has defended the budget-cut claim by saying that in other states, taxes were increased to cover shortfalls. While Crist didn’t push for tax increases to make up the entire shortfall, he did approve fee and tax increases this year — on everything from fishing licenses to initial vehicle registrations to cigarettes — that total $2.2 billion. So while it is true that state government has shrunk by 10 percent since Crist’s election, it had little to do with him, and a lot to do with the shrinking economy. For those reasons, we give Crist’s statement a Barely True.""",1
"Q: Are Muslim nurses excused from washing their hands before medical procedures in Britain? A: No. That is an old misrepresentation that has been circulating online since 2010. A false story that started in Britain eight years ago has immigrated to America.In 2010, the website for the far-right British National Party claimed that the country’s National Health Service had changed its hygiene rules to allow Muslim nurses to skip washing their hands before seeing patients. It wasn’t true, but the claim had an appeal that allowed it to re-emerge several times over the years — including in 2013, 2014 and 2016. In March, it showed up on a website called hardcoreUSAnews.com.That recent version concludes: “So it’s true. Sharia law is actually hazardous to your health. Wonder if it would be possible to get a Surgeon General’s warning slapped on every Koran sold in the U.S.?”That story was posted on Facebook page called World Against Terrorism, which has more than 35,000 followers. Some Facebook users flagged the story as potentially false. It is.The original claim from the British National Party was posted shortly after the United Kingdom’s Department of Health updated its recommendations on uniforms for health care workers in March 2010.The original story said, in part: “female Muslim staff will now be exempt from the rule that all personnel be scrubbed and bare below the elbow.” That is a complete misrepresentation of what the amended recommendations from the department actually advised.After convening a group of Islamic scholars, chaplains, health policy makers, and infection prevention experts, the department recommended that uniforms can include long sleeves when the worker is not directly caring for patients and workers can use disposable forearm covers when they are also using gloves. The covers, with elastic at the elbow and wrist, are to be treated the same as gloves. In all instances, the guidance states, “Strict procedures for washing hands and wrists must still be observed.”That clear requirement for hand washing is made at least twice in the document.Still, hardcoreUSAnews.com wrote in its recent story: “Muslim nurses in the UK have now been granted the option of participating in medical operations without washing their hands.”That’s just not accurate.Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.“Islamic Colonisation of Britain Continues: NHS Relaxes Hygiene Measure to Accommodate Muslim Staff but Bans Crucifix.” BNP.org.uk. 11 Apr 2010.“U.K Hospitals: Muslim Surgical Nurses, Actually All Muslim Nurses, No Longer Required To Wash Their Hands….” theconservativetreehouse.com. 29 Apr 2013.“Muslim Nurses Refuse To Wash Hands Before Operations, Say It ‘Compromises Religious Beliefs.” jewsnews.co.il. 20 Oct 2014.“Muslim Nurses refuse to wash hands in UK Hospitals according to Sharia Law.” terrornewsnetwork.com. 9 May 2016.“MUSLIM NURSES REFUSE TO WASH HANDS BEFORE OPERATIONS, THE REASON WHY IS INSANE.” hardcoreUSAnews.com. 12 Mar 2018.Department of Health. “Uniforms and workwear: Guidance on uniform and workwear policies for NHS employers.” NationalArchives.gov.uk.

"The “Mexico City Policy”, also known as the “global gag rule”, also led to more pregnancies and lower contraceptive use among women in African countries reliant on U.S. foreign aid, the study in the Lancet Global Health journal showed. The policy prevents U.S. federal funding from being used overseas to support any organization that performs or provides counseling on abortion. Successive U.S. administrations have flip-flopped between rescinding and reinstating it along partisan lines since it was created by the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan in 1984. “Our findings suggest how a U.S. policy that aims to restrict federal funding for abortion services can lead, unintentionally, to more – and probably riskier – abortions in poor countries,” said Nina Brooks, a researcher at Stanford University who co-led the work. The researchers urged the United States, as the world’s biggest donor of development assistance, to recognize the health of mothers as “a global priority”, and warned that the Mexico City Policy’s knock-on effects could add to maternal death rates. The study looked at induced abortion, contraception use and pregnancy rates between 1995 and 2014. It used data from 26 sub-Saharan African countries over two U.S. policy transitions - from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, then from Bush to Barack Obama - and compared rates in countries exposed to a greater or lesser extent to the policy due to reliance on aid. The researchers used what they called a “difference-in-difference” method to identify any changes - in other words they analyzed whether the difference between rates or abortion, pregnancy and contraceptive use in high-exposure countries versus low-exposure countries were significantly greater when the policy was in place than when it was not. Results showed a significant 40% increase in abortion rates in exposed countries when the policy was active, as well as a 13.5% relative drop in the use of modern contraceptives, and a 12% rise in rates of pregnancy. Stanford University’s Eran Bendavid, who co-led the study, said its findings had probably captured only a partial view of the policy’s harm to maternal health, since knock-on effects of risky abortions were not measured. “Because abortions are an important cause of maternal mortality, the increase in abortion uptake might also increase maternal deaths — and possibly disproportionately given that abortions under the policy could be less safe,” he said.",0
"""Members of the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club are known for asking tough, pointed and sometimes over-the-top questions of the politicians who speak at their regular luncheon meeting. The May 13, 2011, event -- which was broadcast on WEDU's """"Florida This Week"""" program -- was no exception. We'll cut to the chase. A questioner asked first-term state Rep. Jeff Brandes, a Republican representing District 52 in Pinellas County, if he was a fraud. """"When you ran for office, if I recall correctly, you said, 'Now when I get elected, I'm gonna really take that Legislature to the woodshed,' """" a man named Thomas Dunn said to Brandes. """"But when you got elected, somehow you lost your backbone and you became a lackey if not a lapdog for the speaker. So my question is, when you ran for office, were you a fraud?"""" Brandes, who ran a campaign commercial vowing to take Tallahassee """"to the woodshed,"""" sat back in his chair and chuckled. """"That's an interesting question,"""" he started in response. """"If you'll go back and watch that commercial, and read it line by line, what you'll see what I said is, for those that want to increase taxes or increase government regulation, we're going to take them to the woodshed. That was the exact line. I know and understand everybody wants me to take everybody to the woodshed, and sometimes it's probably appropriate."""" He continued: """"The reality is, I think I stood up on a number of issues against the speaker and against the governor. I've gotten a phone call from the Governor's Office saying why don't you think welfare recipients should be drug-tested. I believe it's a violation of people's privacy to do that. And I stood up and did that (voted against that). So I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board. That takes a little bit of courage. So to say I have no courage, no backbone, is, I think, a little disingenuous."""" Brandes repeatedly used the woodshed imagery during the campaign because he used to be in the lumber business -- his family once owned Cox Lumber. He said in the television ad that """"high taxes and over-regulation have got to stop so jobs can return. If Tallahassee gets in the way, we're taking them to the woodshed."""" And at his election night victory party after defeating incumbent state Rep. Bill Heller, he signed blocks of wood. Some Democrats, and apparently Dunn, took the line to mean that Brandes would take Tallahassee to the woodshed on every issue. While that may be a stretch, Brandes did defend his record as being an independent voice in the Legislature in his response. So we decided to check his record from the 2011 legislative session. Turns out, there are examples where Brandes bucked the Republican leadership, and even the entire Florida House of Representatives. Brandes was the lone person in the Legislature to vote against HB 949, a bill that added some licensing requirements for pest control businesses. The bill passed the House 116-1 and the Senate 38-0. Brandes' legislative aide, Nick Hansen, said Brandes voted against the bill because it included additional regulations. Brandes also was the lone """"no"""" vote on SB 650, which allows a mobile home park homeowners association a chance to buy its park outright if the owner is considering changing its land use. The bill passed the House 114-1 and the Senate 39-0. And he opposed the majority of Republicans on several other issues:  HB 88: Brandes was one of two Republicans to oppose a bill that put restrictions on the amount of severance pay public employees can receive. The bill passed both chambers. SB 330: Brandes was one of four members of the Legislature and the only Republican to vote against a bill that makes it an election code violation for candidates to falsely say they served in the U.S. military. (Brandes is a former officer in the U.S. Army Reserves who served in the most recent Iraq war.) The bill passed both chambers. HB 661: Brandes was one of four Republicans to oppose a bill that would cap damages in wrongful death cases at nursing homes at $250,000. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. An amendment to HB 733: Brandes was the only Republican to join Democrats in supporting an amendment that would have lengthened an August sales tax holiday. (Two other Republicans initially voted with Brandes, but later changed their vote.) The bill did not pass. And as he said at Tiger Bay, Brandes was one of two House Republicans to vote against HB 353, which requires cash welfare recipients to first pass a drug test. Brandes spoke on the House floor that the measure violated people's privacy rights. The bill passed both chambers. Now, Brandes didn't always buck his own party. In fact, he was in lockstep on most of its highest priorities. He voted for GOP bills that prohibit public employees unions from collecting dues through automatic payroll deductions (which ultimately failed), restrict or limit abortions (passed), loosen the state's growth management laws (passed), change election law (passed), and to ask voters to approve a constitutional amendment creating two Supreme Courts (failed). He also voted for the budget. But in this fact-check, we're judging his words. Brandes said: """"I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board."""" Measuring """"a lot"""" can be subjective, but Brandes is right that on two occasions he was the only """"no"""" vote in the Legislature. In other cases, he bucked his party and stood with Democrats. We don't know if that adds up to taking them to the woodshed or not. But we do know it makes his statement .""",0
"It discusses the drug’s costs, which are expected to be substantial. Given the relatively small population that the drug might be of benefit to, price considerations are important. The story briefly notes both aspects. We liked the early caveat that VX-770 is designed for use in only 4% of people with CF, or 1200 Americans. It summarizes the alternative treatments for CF. It would’ve been interesting to note what other therapies subjects in this study received.",0
"This story doesn’t mention the costs of the fish oil supplements it appears to support. However, the cost of such supplements is reasonable and the period in which they’re recommended is short — the last trimester of pregnancy — making cost a lesser concern than in some cases. The story explains the benefit this way:  “At age 6, children whose mothers took fish oil supplements while pregnant had a 395 grams higher total mass, 281 grams higher lean mass and 10 grams higher bone mineral content than children whose mothers who took olive oil during pregnancy, the findings showed.” This is sufficient, but the story could have provided some context on whether these numbers are clinically meaningful. Is 395 grams (less than a pound) a big deal? What about 10 grams more bone mineral content? Is that change big enough to reduce fractures, for example? The story didn’t discuss any risks of taking fish oil. But these include belching, bad breath, heartburn, nausea, loose stools, rash, and nosebleeds. For pregnant women who have to be vigilant about even seemingly harmless side effects (nausea can be a serious symptom in the third trimester, for example), these details are important. The story points out that this study used both an experimental and control group to test their hypothesis about fish oil supplements, and mentioned the large number of participants who took part — 736 pregnant women. It also included some of the study’s limitations and explained that growth wasn’t the primary measurement researchers were following, it was actually development of asthma. No disease mongering here. The story provides comments from independent sources unaffiliated with the research. We did not detect any conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed. Since there is little existing research in this area, the inclusion of another alternative would be difficult. Fish oil supplements are readily available. The story made very brief mention of other research in this area. Past trials of fish oil supplements during pregnancy or breast feeding, using different designs, doses, and follow up periods, have shown mixed results. The story would have been strengthened by some context, including findings of other studies and what is known of a possible mechanism for an effect of fish oil on growth of offspring. The story doesn’t appear to rely on a news release.",0
"In one study, presented on Tuesday at 2011 National HIV Prevention Conference in Atlanta, researchers at the Cleveland Department of Public Health saw big improvements in rates of HIV testing when they added reminders to patients’ electronic health records about the need for routine testing. In another, officials in the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health used disease mapping technology to identify HIV-infected patients not getting adequate treatment — increasing the risk of transmission. Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the division of HIV/AIDS Prevention at the Centers for Disease and Prevention, which sponsored the conference, said the studies, and others like it, will help as the agency implements the National HIV/AIDS Strategy introduced by the White House last summer. That plan aims to focus resources where HIV is most heavily concentrated — among gay and bisexual men of all races, blacks and Hispanics. Currently, about 1.2 million people in the United States are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and about one out of five people who are infected do not know it. And rates are much higher among high-risk individuals, according to data from a CDC study of 21 cities presented at the meeting by CDC’s Dr. Alexandra Oster. Oster’s team found that HIV continues to severely impact three groups at high risk of infection — men who have sex with men, injection drug users and poor heterosexuals. The study, which included data on nearly 30,000 individuals, found 19 percent of men who have sex with men were infected with HIV, 9 percent of injection drug users were infected, and 2 percent of heterosexuals in low-socioeconomic groups were infected. That compares with infection rates of just 0.47 percent in the overall U.S. population. Among those who were infected, nearly half did not know they were HIV positive. To help remind doctors of the need for testing, Dr. Ann Avery of the Cleveland Department of Public Health studied the impact of adding reminders to the electronic medical record system used at MetroHealth, a Cleveland-based hospital system that provides care to patients regardless of insurance status. When they started the study, only 4 percent of patients aged 13 to 64 were screened for HIV from 2008 to 2009. To increase routine HIV testing, last July MetroHealth added an HIV testing prompt to the electronic medical records system reminding doctors to screen all patients aged 13 to 64 if they had not been previously tested. Within six months of the changes, HIV testing in the hospital’s outpatient clinics rose dramatically, increasing by nearly two-thirds. The effort was especially effective at increasing testing among men, with first-time testing rising from 2.9 percent of those tested to 6.1 percent. Separately, a team led by Dr. Jennifer Sayles, director of Office of AIDS Programs and Policy for Los Angeles County used disease mapping software to track HIV infection and treatment rates among the county’s more than 10 million residents. Sayles studied treatment coverage among more than 12,000 HIV-infected individuals whose care was paid for through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which provides HIV-related services to those who do cannot afford their care. Overall, 90 percent of patients reported getting antiretroviral drugs to keep the virus under control. But a cross-check of postal codes showed significant variation in treatment by neighborhood. Where patients lived also played a role in how well their infection was controlled. In general, blacks, people under 24, recent substance abusers, recent prisoners and the poor were more likely to have poorly controlled disease. Sayles said the study will be used to help target resources to those who need it most.",0
"Sanofi announced the plan hours before one of its executives was set to testify before a congressional committee on the rising prices of insulin. Executives from the other leading insulin producers - Eli Lilly & Co and Novo Nordisk A/S - will also testify. The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication. Under its plan, Sanofi said people with diabetes in the United States can buy up to 10 boxes of insulin pens or vials with a valid prescription for $99 per month, beginning in June. The price of other manufacturers’ leading insulin products is $178 to $300 per vial and $235 to $563 per pack of pens, according to Sanofi. The move is an expansion of Sanofi’s “Insulin Valyou Savings Program” launched last year and represents a significant savings for patients already enrolled who had been paying $99 for each vial of insulin and $149 for each pack of insulin pens. “When you hear us say in our testimony in the hearing tomorrow that it is heartbreaking and no one should have to go without insulin, we mean it,” Michelle Carnahan, Head of North America primary care at Sanofi, said in an interview on Tuesday. Sanofi is not the first company to cut insulin prices in response to intensifying criticism from patients and politicians. Last month, Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a half price, authorized generic version of its popular Humalog insulin injection. The list price for Lilly’s authorized generic, to be sold only in the United States, will be $137.35 per vial. Patients with high out-of-pocket insulin costs can participate in the Sanofi program regardless of their income level, Sanofi said. Under current regulations, it can not offer the plan to patients insured under the government’s Medicare or  Medicaid programs or similar federal and state health programs. In terms of profitability, Sanofi said it believes the pricing program is sustainable for the long term. The company’s diabetes business brought in about 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in U.S. sales last year. Since Sanofi launched its “Insulins Valyou Savings Program” last April around 12,000 patients have utilized the program, saving about $10 million, the company said.",0
"No dollar signs here. However, not including a mastectomy (anywhere from $15,000 to $55,000 or more), tissue-expander breast surgeries typically cost about $40,000 per breast. But if there are any complications, those costs can skyrocket due to additional surgeries and other medical costs. The benefits are described — “diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome” — but not quantified, neither alone nor in comparison to other options. How much is pain reduced by this procedure? How much faster is the recovery time? How much better can women get around? What constitutes “excellent” when it comes to the look of a reconstructed breast? We aren’t told. Even if the release had quantified the results or made a comparison to other techniques, this is a report of one procedure in one patient. It is not possible to make general statements about the benefits of a procedure when only one procedure has been performed. As a 2013 New York Times Well blog post highlights, about one-in-four nipple-sparing surgeries (promoted by this release) lead to dead tissue “in the areola or in nearby skin” — and additional surgeries to remove that dead tissue. The risks or necessity of mastectomy and reconstructive breast surgery aren’t mentioned, either. Mastectomies (as compared to lumpectomies or avoiding surgery altogether) may not lead to better outcomes for many women. Also, implants can leak, cause infections, and lead to other complications. We’re also not told how radiation and chemotherapy — two extremely common treatments in conjunction with breast cancer surgeries — affect results. The one saving grace of this release is its last word, which makes a case for approaching each woman’s diagnosis and treatment on an individual basis. Throughout the release, we get an earful about cause-and-effect relationship: If you do get tissue expander before, then you’ll heal faster, suffer less, and look better. But all we get is a vague mention to “ongoing research.” What and where are these studies? At the very least, how are outcomes measured? Who is this procedure appropriate or inappropriate for? The lack of key details that support the release’s claims is a major oversight. This is a procedure not commonly performed, and more study is needed to identify best candidates for the procedure as well as to evaluate the complications and long term results. Descriptions of pain and long recovery periods are found in this release. But that seems essential to the nature of this procedure, which aims to reduce these and other problems. The Valley Breast Center is listed at the end of the release. But due to the overwhelmingly positive comments from the patient who received the procedure, it would have helped to make clear whether or not she was compensated in any form by the hospital system. Options for reconstructive breast surgeries are as numerous as they are nuanced, depending on the needs of the patient. However, none of them — one-stage implant surgeries, muscle flap surgeries, etc. — get even a passing mention. In the context of this procedure, it would have been helpful to clear up the alternatives, including the more-common procedure of getting an implant beneath the chest muscle (where it’s less likely to cause complications). It should always be stressed that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to breast cancer reconstruction. Factors taken into account include the patient’s constitution, other medical problems, location of the cancer in the breast, type of cancer, need for preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy, need for radiation therapy, and patient preferences for cosmetic outcome. In addition, extensive discussion needs to be held regarding the potential complications of each reconstructive approach. We’re told The Valley Hospital performed this surgery, and — by implication of going through the effort of issuing a news release — we have to assume the hospital plans to perform this surgery again for patients who qualify. However, that isn’t made clear. This is definitely not a new technique. However it needs to be stressed that there are very good reasons why it is not commonly performed, and this release does not discuss any of them. The novelty is essentially lost in this release — the most we’re told is that this is a “variation of a standard technique.” Almost all tissue-expanding breast surgeries place a balloon-like sac beneath chest muscles and on top of the ribs, where they’re better held in place (and less likely to protrude through surgical cuts). The procedure described here places the implant on top of the chest muscles — right below the skin. Breast surgeons typically avoid this because the breast skin alone might not be able to support a saline-filled sac after an aggressive surgery, even if filed gradually over weeks. And as much as this release tries to make the procedure seem new, it’s not; it just appears to be new within this particular corner of New Jersey. Hyped terms like “innovative” and phrases such as “has the potential to be a ‘game-changer'” are found throughout this release — and there’s almost nothing to back them up.",1
"Since the middle of the last century, revolving doors have been a quietly ubiquitous feature of modern cities around the world. But do they have their origins in one man’s neurotic attitude toward holding doors open for women? The most often-cited example of this legend is a 2013 article in Slate by Roman Mars, of the design podcast 99% Invisible. The story goes like this: Theophilus Van Kannel hated chivalry. There was nothing he despised more than trying to walk in or out of a building, and locking horns with other men in a game of “oh you first, I insist.” But most of all, Theophilus Van Kannel hated opening doors for women. He set about inventing his way out of social phobia. In the accompanying podcast episode, Mars warned: “Keep in mind that with all these origin stories, when they sound a little too much like stories, they’re probably not completely true.”  David McCall, writing in the Australian Design Review four years later, also traced the invention to Van Kannel’s purported misogyny: The story goes that he invented the revolving door because he simply hated holding doors open for people, especially women. It has also been reported that Kannel [sic] was a man without a family. These two facts may not be unrelated. The earliest version of the story that we could find was a 2008 post by Jaime Morrison on the art and design blog The Nonist, which went into considerable detail about the origins of Van Kannel’s aversion to chivalry, tracing it back to a public spanking from his mother and attributing his invention to his wife’s insistence that he hold open doors for her at all times. It seems that when Van Kennel [sic] was a boy, still in the care of his mother but just on the cusp of cultural manhood, he found the lingering rules of chivalry rather bothersome. In particular he refused to accept that he was expected to open the door for women and allow them to cross the threshold before him. A silly sort of quirk to our minds, certainly, but it was taken seriously enough by his mother that after numerous warnings and threats she eventually felt compelled to take action. Van Kennel [sic] family histories have it that at some point in his twelfth year she administered a savage bare-bottomed spanking, during a salon in the family’s drawing room, in full and explicit view of 37 local mothers and daughters. …Had this been the only episode the world may have never had a revolving door to shuffle through. As it so happens, however, Theophilus Van Kennel [sic] married a woman who, though beautiful and slyly clever, had an odd and stubborn quirk of her own. Young Abigail Van Kennel, it seems, refused to pass from one room of their apartments to another without the assistance of Theophilus. That blog post contains the tongue-in-cheek disclaimer that “…All untruths are, I assure you, my own. I’ll leave it to you to sort out which is which”; and cites just one source, an essay by the MIT professor James Buzard — which makes no mention of Van Kannel’s now-legendary misogyny. Indeed, despite extensive archival research, we did not find any evidence to back up the persistent rumor that Theophilus Van Kannel invented and refined the revolving door because of a neurotic aversion to holding doors open for women and others. In fact, we found several pieces of evidence which severely undermine the credibility of this claim. In July 1882, an H. Bockhacker received a patent in Berlin for a “Thür ohne Luftzug” (“draftless door”) whose design is essentially that of a revolving door. Six years later, on 7 August 1888, Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania received Patent #387,571 for his “Storm Door Structure.” In his patent application, Van Kannel wrote: It will be evident that a storm door structure of the character described possesses numerous advantages over a hinged-door structure of the usual character, for, as the door fits snugly in the casing, it is perfectly noiseless in its operation and effectually prevents the entrance of wind, snow, rain, or dust either when it is closed or when persons are passing through it. Moreover, the door cannot be blown open by the wind, as the pressure is equal on both sides of the center of motion. Van Kannel subsequently patented several refinements and improvements to the revolving door, founded the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company, and died in New York City on Christmas Eve, 1919, at the age of 78. He was born in a log cabin in Coshocton County, Ohio, on 21 October 1841, to Swiss immigrant parents. Throughout his life, he was a prolific inventor. A 1988 publication of his autobiography and journal, housed in the Library of Congress, lists 49 patents, but the book’s editor writes that Van Kannel might have actually put his name to “about 75” of them. Over the years, Theophilus invented a cherry stoner, cider mill, water hydrant, shipping tag, gas machine check-valve, a sewing machine, an “apparatus for scalding vegetable or fruit,” and many more. He was also the inventor and owner of the Witching Waves ride at a Coney Island amusement park. He married Amanda Clayton, of Chester, Illinois and in November 1867 the couple had a daughter named Lulu. This refutes David McCall’s suggestion that Van Kannel’s alleged misogyny was due to the fact that he did not have a family. He did. The fact that Van Kannel’s wife was named Amanda also severely undermines The Nonist’s colorful stories about his wife “Abigail,” who “refused to pass from one room of their apartments to another.” In fact, Theophilus Van Kannel’s two-volume, almost 500-page autobiography and journal does not contain any evidence of any neurosis relating to women, nor any social phobias of any kind. What it does reveal is a multi-talented young man, somewhat sober and straight-laced, who struggled for many years with debt and an artificial leg, but enjoyed a fairly healthy social life, combined with a consistent dedication to his work. He wrote frequently to his mother, regularly visited his sister and her family, and spoke lovingly about his female relatives. (His journal entry on 30 January 1864 reads: “Letter from my sister requesting me to write an obituary for her husband. Sent $5 to mother.”) Another entry suggests Van Kannel understood and honored the Victorian norms of chivalry, without any reservations. 28 September 1861 (aged 19): …I received permission to buy some window blinds for the schoolhouse. While in the post office a very old lady came in to send off a letter, but she had no money to pay for the stamp. She asked the postmaster, Mr Bowman, to credit her, but he refused. I then bought ten cents’ worth of stamps and sent her letter. She was a stranger to me… As he grew into his 20s, Van Kannel’s journal shows him courting young women in Cincinnati, Ohio, all the while following the rules of chivalry and decorum. 26 February 1863 (aged 21): We all went to the church again this evening to practice our parts for the exhibition, and all showed great improvement. For the first time I mustered up enough courage to ask a young lady for her company home, and she very readily accepted. Nothing in his journal suggests the kind of “social phobia” or misogyny involved in the many stories told about him 150 years later. He attended church every Sunday, taught children, attended school with men and women, was an active member of debating societies, met friends for dinner and drinks (although he disliked drunkenness), and occasionally escorted young women home or to the theater. His interests and inventions were eclectic. By 1867 he was already developing a type of door spring, and so it’s not at all surprising that he would turn his mind to the innovation that eventually became the revolving door. Swinging doors let in drafts, making it difficult to control the temperature of a building, especially one with heavy footfall like a bank or train station. It is in keeping with the pattern of Van Kannel’s professional life that he would have identified this problem, and attempted to solve it using his gift for engineering. His invention of the revolving door does not require a psychological motivation. Nor were we able to find one, despite reading hundreds of pages of archival material and the journal of Theophilus Van Kannel himself. We looked at several news and feature articles about Van Kannel, some dating to the early 20th century. Not one mentioned Van Kannel’s now-mythical misogyny or aversion to chivalry — until The Nonist post, the veracity of which is extremely questionable. We contacted the 99% Invisible podcast, but we did not receive a reply by publication time. In October 2018, we received an email from Jaime Morrison, creator of the Nonist blog and author of the 2008 article about Theophilus Van Kannel and the invention of the revolving door. Morrison told us that he had written about Van Kannel’s now-legendary misogyny as no more than a joke which he was disappointed to find had been taken seriously by others:",1
"There is no discussion of the costs of hip replacement, even though it is a common procedure and its costs are widely discussed. For example, a Blue Cross Blue Shield report noted an average cost of about $30,000, but with wide variations, ranging between “$11,327 in Birmingham, Alabama, and $73,987 in Boston.” The basic premise of the story is that “same-day” hip replacement offers important advantages to patients, but the only benefit specifically noted in the story is that people who opt for this procedure are less likely to spend a night in the hospital. Even then, there are only vague references and quotes from the surgeon on how many patients really go home the same day. Indeed, the one patient named in the story did not go home the same day. The story does note that studies following hip replacement patients for at least six months find no important differences in how they fare depending on which sort of procedure they had. Still, the overall thrust of the story is that “same-day” is superior, without critically evaluating the differences between going home that day or the next. We will give the story a Satisfactory rating on this criterion because it includes comments from a surgeon who warns about the risk of serious complications during the first night after surgery. However, the most prominent voice in the story is a surgeon who dismisses those concerns by saying, “if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital. It really doesn’t make sense.” We’re not given any information or data that proves this “doesn’t make sense,” though. We also think potential harms that could have been included are falling at home due to dizziness, or otherwise not being adequately prepared for managing under major surgery. The story does mention one study that found no difference in longer term outcomes of two types of hip replacement procedures. However, it fails to note that there are few good studies comparing outcomes of different types of hip replacement procedures and that the choice may rest largely on the personal experiences and preferences of individual surgeons, rather than robust scientific evidence. The story does not exaggerate the extent of hip problems or the relevance of replacement surgery to people with chronic hip pain. This does appear to target younger, healthier people, and surgery for them comes with special considerations–a hip replacement has a 20 to 25 year life span, less when put into a more physically active person. So, younger people may face a second procedure at an older age. When deciding on the timing of the first procedure, this should be considered since second surgeries are more involved and higher risk. This story does include a surgeon who is skeptical of the benefits of “same-day” hip replacements. However, as noted above, the surgeon advocating the “same-day” procedure is featured far more prominently, likely creating an imbalance in reader perceptions. But the main reason for marking down the story on this criterion is that it fails to tell readers that NYU Langone has a marketing campaign tied to “same-day” hip surgery. The result is that the story supports the promotional efforts of the hospital and its surgeons without alerting readers to the commercial aspects of the matter. The hospital tweeted an image of an earlier story on “same-day” hip replacement, indicating the marketing department understands the value of friendly coverage. HealthNewsReview.org also reviewed that Wall Street Journal story. As noted above, the story exaggerates the differences between hip replacements billed as “same-day” and those that give patients more conservative timelines. The story offers examples of hospitals currently offering “same-day” hip replacements. If anything the story understates the availability of the procedure. However, the story could have been more clear about who this procedure is most available to, since this won’t be the right option for some people. For example, if they don’t have help at home, or if they live far from the hospital. The story implies “same-day” hip replacement is new. While the practice is becoming more common, it is part of a long-term gradual trend toward shorter hospital stays, rather than a sudden break with past practice. In fact, reports on the technique note that over a decade ago some hip replacement patients were discharged the same day. The impression that NYU Langone Medical Center has a new type of procedure appears to be more marketing spin than medical fact. The story includes original interviews and other reporting.",1
"“Life became unbearable. From the time I got up in the morning until when I went to bed at night, I struggled through every breath of air,” De Freitas, now 74, told Reuters by phone from his home in Toronto. After two years, De Freitas was offered a lung, with one significant downside: The donor had hepatitis C.  In October 2017, he became the first patient enrolled in a just published study conducted at Toronto General Hospital testing a technique that aimed to flush out and inactivate the hepatitis C virus from donor lungs before a transplant. The research comes amid a spike in available organs linked to the opioid overdose crisis, meaning many are contaminated by hepatitis C as the virus is commonly spread by sharing needles. Since it can easily infect an organ recipient, those organs are usually discarded despite the urgent need. Data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which matches donors with recipients, shows that 97 percent of people  waiting for a lung in the United States last year were unwilling to accept an organ from a donor who tested positive for hepatitis C.  While hepatitis C causes serious liver disease, the virus can be present in the blood in other organs. Researchers are testing different approaches to salvage infected organs. A study published in April showed that giving patients antiviral therapy just hours after transplant surgery can successfully attack the virus before it gains a foothold in the recipient. Eliminating the virus prior to transplant would simplify the procedure for patients, said UNOS Chief Medical Officer David Klassen. It could also significantly cut down on wasted donor organs. The technique used in Toronto, known as ex vivo lung perfusion, keeps organs “alive” outside the body by pumping them with a bloodless oxygenated liquid. They used ultraviolet C light to irradiate the solution, aiming to deactivate the hepatitis C virus and make it non-infectious. Perfusion allows doctors to evaluate and potentially rehabilitate organs for transplant, and buys them more time than  storage in ice boxes, which can cause tissue damage. Toronto researchers used a solution from Sweden’s Xvivo Perfusion AB with the hospital’s own ex vivo lung perfusion system, a bubble-like machine made from off-the-shelf components and an intensive care ventilator. The study of 22 patients, published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine on Wednesday, had mixed results. Adding light therapy significantly decreased the amount of virus, but all but two of the patients contracted hepatitis C, which is now curable. Infected patients, including De Freitas, were treated with a 12-week course of antiviral drugs that rendered the virus undetectable in all of them. Two of those patients relapsed but were retreated and cured. One patient in the study died due to complications from lung transplantation. “All of the patients were in a very sick condition,” said Marcelo Cypel, surgical director at University Health Network in Toronto and co-author of The Lancet Respiratory Medicine study. “Perhaps some of them wouldn’t have made it to the transplant in time if they were not offered these type of organs.”  The researchers are planning another study combining perfusion with a photodynamic therapy, a type of light they believe could be more effective against the virus than ultraviolet because it can penetrate the organ as well as the solution. For a graphic on U.S. organ donors by mechanism of death:  here  In the United States alone, almost 113,000 people are on organ transplant lists, including more than 1,400 awaiting a new lung. Hundreds die each year while on the list or after becoming too sick to endure a transplant. A tragic public health crisis has led to an unexpected opportunity. With the jump in deaths from opioids such as heroin and fentanyl, overdose victims now account for 13% of U.S. organ donations, up from less than 4% a decade ago, according to UNOS. Many of those organs are going to waste. For example, last year less than 4% of hepatitis C positive donors in the United States had lungs used for transplantation, the study’s authors said in the paper. Other researchers are working with perfusion technology to improve the function of donated lungs, hearts and livers. Scientists at the University of Oxford were able to improve the quality of 16 donated livers with signs of a fatty liver disease. They treated donated organs outside the body with drugs and captured fat that was washed out of the liver through a filter on a transportable perfusion device developed by Britain-based OrganOx, according to a study presented last year. OrganOx has European Union clearance to use its device on livers and hopes to gain U.S. approval by the end of 2020. Perfusion device use currently is limited by cost, which can stretch to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and by lack of expertise and training. De Freitas, though, is grateful the Toronto researchers are testing perfusion to salvage organs. “Every day I get up and I thank the Lord, I thank the doctors because I am not supposed to be here,” he said. “I am supposed to be on the other side.”      (This story adds dropped words to name of medical journal)",0
"A study published on Friday involving two species from South Africa, Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus, showed they boasted better hearing than either chimps or people in a frequency range that may have facilitated vocal communication in a savanna habitat. Both species featured a mixture of ape-like and human-like anatomical traits and inhabited grassland ecosystems with widely spaced trees and shrubs, as opposed to the forests of earlier members of human lineage. In both species, maximum hearing sensitivity was shifted toward slightly higher frequencies compared to chimpanzees, and both had better hearing than chimps or humans in the range from about 1.0-3.0 kilohertz, paleoanthropologist Rolf Quam of Binghamton University in New York said. Sounds in that range include vowels and some consonants, Quam said. “It turns out that this auditory pattern may have been particularly favorable for living on the savanna. In more open environments, sound waves don’t travel as far as in the rainforest canopy, so short-range communication is favored on the savanna,” Quam said. The human lineage split from chimps roughly 5 to 7 million years ago, Quam said, and our ancestors’ hearing abilities began to adapt to lifestyle changes. To assess the two species’ hearing abilities, the researchers studied fossils including tiny middle-ear bones called the ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) and created virtual computer reconstructions of the ear’s internal anatomy. Our species, Homo sapiens, which arose about 200,000 years ago, is distinct from most other primates in having better hearing across a wider range of frequencies, generally from 1.0 to 6.0 kilohertz. This range encompasses many sounds emitted during spoken language. “I want to be clear that we are not arguing that these early humans had language, which implies a symbolic content,” Quam said. “Certainly they could communicate vocally. All primates do. But human language emerged during our evolutionary history at some time after the existence of these early humans.”  Paleontologist Juan Luis Arsuaga of Spain’s Universidad Complutense de Madrid said their hearing abilities indicate their voices “would sound strange, half chimp-like, half human, to us. Or in other terms, not completely human.”  The research appears in the journal Science Advances,",0
"The original AP story told readers the cost of devices, approximately $6,000, and monthly supplies, approximately $250. The St. Paul Pioneer Press, in its shortened version of the AP story, left this information out. So our grade is for the Pioneer Press effort, not the original AP story. This article fairly communicates the risks and benefits of insulin pump use among adolescents. It does not overstate the main benefit of allowing young people to live more normal lives by eliminating the need for multiple daily insulin injections. The overall focus of the original research and this article was on the potential harms of insulin pump use by adolescents and the need to address safety concerns. Potential causes of adverse events related to patient use and education and device malfunction were appropriately described. This article could have been improved by including the importance of parental oversight in preventing adverse events, particularly since three of the five deaths occurred at times when there was no parental supervision. This article includes the key findings and conclusions reported in the Pediatrics study. Some of the study methodology, e.g. the 10-year time period of the investigation, was provided. But there is no mention that this was a retrospective study and what limitations such a study may have. The story mentions 13 deaths and > 1,500 injuries over 10 years, but fails to give the denominator of subjects involved. In addition, the research study also examined the use of analgesia pump use in adolescents which was not covered in the story. Why not? This article accurately summarizes the prevalence of adverse events related to insulin pump usage in adolescents and presents this information without sensationalism. The brief amount of background information on Type 1 diabetes was useful for context. The original AP story included the perspective of an independent expert, the American Diabetes Association’s president for medicine and science. It also included input from the editor of a patient newsletter. But the Pioneer Press deleted these perspectives. Instead, the St. Paul story included a quote from the manufacturer of the top-selling insulin pump. Why? Because it’s a local Twin Cities company? Multiple daily insulin injections, the standard most widely used treatment option for Type I diabetes, is appropriately referenced. The story establishes availability in its lead sentence when it clearly states that insulin pumps are used by tens of thousands of teenagers worldwide. This article accurately indicates that insulin pumps have been available and used for many years. There is no evidence that the AP story relied solely or largely on a news release.",0
"""The article fails to mention the cost of treatment or whether it is covered by Medicare or other insurers. There is no quantification of benefits. The story reports ony the anecdotal experience on one patient with one surgeon. The article mentions a single disadvantage of the operation—that patients can’t lift heavy objects. But any patient undergoing joint replacement faces potential complications such as infection. In one recent study, 52% of patients had a complication after wrist replacement and 44% reported pain one to five years after surgery. (J Hand Surg [Am]. 2003;28:570-6). There is also the possibility of undergoing a second operation for fusion if the implant fails—a risk that persists with newer implant designs as well as old ones. The article does not cite a source for the projected 10- to 15-year life of the device. There is no discussion of evidence, a major lapse. Readers should know that there is scant high-quality literature on wrist replacement. Some experts consider the procedure experimental. The story’s “evidence” is comprised mostly of testimonials of one patient who underwent the operation and one doctor who performs about 10 of the operations every year. There are no obvious elements of disease mongering. It is clear that wrist replacement surgery is a treatment of """"last resort."""" The story relies on one patient and one “expert,” a surgeon who performs wrist replacements. It provides no information on potential conflicts of interest and no conflicting points of view. Input from experts outside of this institution would provide balance and potentially clarify the risks and benefits of this procedure. The article outlines some alternatives to wrist replacement surgery (e.g. medications, physical therapy, and fusion)—and briefly sketches their advantages and disadvantages. There are other surgical treatments for wrist arthritis as well, though the evidence to support them is also sparse. The article explains that wrist replacement has been available for decades. But why is the procedure “seldom used”? Is the device FDA-approved? Is the operation widely available in the U.S., offered in the local community hospital, or mostly consigned to large or academic medical centers? The article does not say. The story points out that wrist replacement surgery has been around for decades. The story’s single source of medical information—a surgeon–suggests that newer versions of the implants enable surgeons to retain more of the patient’s native bone. Two weeks before this story was published, the Texas Medical Center issued a press release about wrist replacement surgery, covering much of the same information in the Houston Chronicle article. The Medical Center is named in the second sentence of the article, and the story’s expert source is the same surgeon that is quoted in the press release. The story fulfills every public relations department’s dream, and does not stray far from the hospital’s and surgeon’s story line. But we can't be sure if the story relied solely or largely on the press release.""",1
"The release does not address cost at all. While guselkumab is not yet on the market, HealthNewsReview.org has long argued that if it is worth discussing a drug’s treatment potential, it’s worth discussing what that treatment might cost — even if it is only in general terms. Certainly, readers of this release would be interested to know that the comparison drug, adalimumab (brand name Humira), costs almost $50,000/year. Considering the similarities between adalimumab and guselkumab, the release should have warned that if this experimental drug is approved, it might well also command a hefty price. The release is fairly clear in this regard, reporting that 81 percent of patients taking a 200-milligram dose of guselkumab reported “minimal” or no psoriasis symptoms after 40 weeks of treatment, compared to 49 percent of patients taking adalimumab. The release doesn’t note that patients taking 200-mg doses of guselkumab did only slightly better than patients taking a 100-mg dose, and that the 100-mg dose fared slightly better at various points during the first 40 weeks of treatment. But that’s a level of detail that perhaps we can’t expect. The release would have been better if it specifically noted that further study will be needed in order to find out if the observed benefits last longer than a year. The release also could have noted that the patients in this study were overwhelmingly white (91%) and male (71%), so it remains to be seen if a more diverse patient population would get similar benefits. The release does not discuss harms at all, which is problematic. The authors of the paper noted the difficulty in identifying true rates of adverse events in the study given the discrepancy in the number of subjects in each treatment group. There was a 6:1 ratio of guselkumab subjects compared to adalimumab in the post placebo phase of the trial. While the true incidence of harm is unclear at the moment, some comment is necessary even in a press release. For example, according to the paper, 20 percent of patients who received guselkumab experienced “adverse events of infection” during the first 16 weeks of the trial, as compared to 14 percent among patients receiving a placebo and 12 percent of patients who received adalimumab. A higher rate of infection is certainly worth mentioning. Heck, even a comparable rate of infection is worth mentioning. Overall, patients who received guselkumab had lower rates of all “adverse events” compared to adalimumab over the first 16 weeks of treatment (50 percent versus 56 percent), and over weeks 16 through 52 of the study (49 percent versus 61 percent). But the rates of adverse events were still noteworthy, and the release should have addressed them. This was a close one. The release does do a fairly good job of describing the overall study, but it fails to mention some important limitations. It explains that it was a multi-center study of 293 adults, it describes the symptoms of the adults, and it describes the study design: some study participants got guselkumab, some got adalimumab, and some got a placebo. It also explains how the study evaluated the effectiveness of the drugs. However, the release does not mention that the number of participants who received guselkumab was relatively small at each dosage level. The press release notes, “…293 adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (defined as covering 10 percent or more of the body) were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of one of the two drugs or a placebo over 52 weeks.”  This suggests that the three cohorts (placebo, guselkumab and adulimumab) were equal in size. Clearly this is not the case. So, when the story notes, “At week 40, for example, 81 percent of patients taking a 200-mg dose of guselkumab had a score of 0 or 1, compared to 49 percent of patients taking adalimumab,” it should have noted that this is in a sample of 42 and 43 subjects respectively. The release should have noted that the results for specific doses of drugs are based on just a few dozen patients. The release should have highlighted a limitation that is noted in the journal article: “Furthermore, some elements of the study design limited the ability to assess uncommon adverse events or adverse events that might have developed during long-term treatment.” And as we already noted, the study is based on a skewed patient population (91% white, 71% male), so it can’t be said that all sorts of psoriasis patients could expect similar results. Psoriasis is a serious health condition, but this release takes it a bit too far. For example, in the fourth paragraph, the release states that psoriasis “also increases a patient’s risk for depression, heart disease and diabetes, among other conditions.” It would have been more accurate to say that it has been associated with, or is linked to, these other conditions. While psoriasis is correlated with an increased risk of multiple adverse health outcomes, it is not known to be the cause of any of them. In most, if not all, cases we know very little about the relationship between psoriasis and those health outcomes. The release also quotes the study’s lead author as saying that “the concept that psoriasis is ‘just something you live with’ is no longer appropriate.” But that source is also cited as saying that about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment. Whether that is by choice, or because the patients don’t have access to treatments or can’t afford the newer, very expensive drugs, it’s clear that many patients with psoriasis do live with the condition. Those dealing with psoriasis already know the value of treatment, they don’t need their condition written about in a way that may stir additional concern. Although the release clearly notes that the study was funded by the company that manufactures guselkumab, and that the study’s lead author is a former paid consultant for the company, it fails to tell readers that the company was actively involved in the study. The journal article points out that Janssen Research and Development collected and analyzed the data. What’s more, “All the authors collaborated on writing the manuscript, with the assistance of professional medical writers employed by Janssen, and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.” That intimate level of involvement should have been made clear in the release. The release discusses only two potential treatments: the drugs guselkumab and adalimumab. There are many additional options. Other medications include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and retinoids, among others. There are also a number of topical treatments and several forms of light therapy. The release would have been stronger if it had explained why guselkumab (or adalimumab, for that matter) are important treatment options or when physicians may incorporate medications like these into their treatment plans. The release makes clear that the study was a phase II clinical trial, and that a phase III trial is ongoing. In other words, the drug will not be available in the very near future. Ideally, the release would remind journalists – and the public – what a Phase II trial means and what it doesn’t mean. The release explains that guselkumab is novel because of its mode of action (i.e., how it works), compared to other, similar drugs. Specifically, the drug blocks a protein that’s implicated in psoriasis. It would have been nice if the release had included another sentence or two on how blocking that protein disrupts psoriasis (or its symptoms). The release uses fairly cautious language throughout, as exemplified in the headline, which says only that guselkumab is “more effective” than adalimumab. However, readers have to be sophisticated enough to know that a phase II trial is merely an intermediate step in the clinical trial process. The release should have noted in the headline and lead paragraphs that further work is needed in order to reach firm conclusions about the effectiveness and potential side effects of this experimental treatment.",1
"Because the release is presented as if the study were conducted in humans, we would expect to see some explanation of what the vaccine might cost. A better news release might have commented on the potential costs (and time) required for testing a new vaccine and bringing it to market. The release mentions the antigen being studied, BD584, “was able to reduce chlamydial shedding – a symptom of C. trachomatis – by 95 per cent.” Without any context for how many people (or mice in this case) were studied, we have no way of knowing what that means. There is no mention of harms in the release. Did any of the mice die or develop sterility or pelvic inflammatory disease? This is the biggest omission in the release and truly surprising for a university. The study itself discusses in detail how the work was conducted in mice. And yet the release says nothing of the sort and, in fact, is set up in such a way that the strong impression is given that this study was conducted in humans. For example, the release says up high, “Researchers at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster have developed the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia. This is quickly followed by the first quote in the release, which says: “Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,” said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster. Until one read the actual study they’d have assumed that this was a human vaccine trial. All of this makes the comments about the potential benefits for human trachoma infections even more absurd. There is no disease mongering in the story. The release notes that the Canadian Institutes for Health Research funded the study. There is no other pharmacological treatment for preventing the chlamydia infection currently available. However, it might have been noted that most public health experts recommend condoms for preventing this and other sexually transmitted diseases. The release makes no mention of the fact that this vaccine is very far away from a clinical application, assuming it would even pass human trials. Instead, it talks about how easy the vaccine would be to administer and how people wouldn’t even need a lot of training to administer it. (We imagine that administering nasal doses to mice would require some training.) There’s no shortage of claims of novelty in the release, including in the headline. Although the release is misleading about the study cohort, it is a novel study given the absence of any available chlamdyia vaccines. We would say that the entire release is unjustifiable given the lack of a mention of the true nature of the study. We also wonder if the investigators were given the opportunity to review the release before it went out.",1
"On 1 November 2018, the Trump administration’s senior adviser on drug pricing reform, Daniel Best, was found “unresponsive” near the garage door exit of a Washington, D.C., apartment building. He was pronounced dead at the scene by first responders. A statement released the same day by Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Alex Azar mourned Best as a “friend and colleague” but addressed neither the circumstances nor the cause of his death. No other details were released to the public. Two weeks later, on 15 November, the office of Washington, D.C.’s chief medical examiner announced that Best had died of “multiple blunt force injuries.” His death was ruled a suicide. No other information was provided. Internet conspiracy theorists questioned that ruling. Noting the pharmaceutical industry’s objections to the very task Best was hired to accomplish (i.e., lowering prescription drug costs), not to mention President Trump’s announcement days before Best’s death of a plan to reduce Medicare drug prices and the fact that Best died of blunt force injuries, the theorists took to social media to float the idea that Best was the victim of foul play and not suicide: BREAKING: Death of Trump HHS official, Daniel Best, tasked with getting lower drug prices from pharmaceutical companies is ruled a suicide, even though he died from “multiple blunt force injuries.” Nothing to see here folks. pic.twitter.com/qiWNH0epeQ — Mike Tokes (@MikeTokes) November 17, 2018  Another ‘suicide’ the Media is ignoring. RIP Daniel Best. #ma4t pic.twitter.com/Gt1wojG3eM — Mike Allen (@AMike4761) November 17, 2018  Far-right conspiracist websites followed suit. An 18 November article on Neon Nettle suggested that the the public was being asked to believe that Best had beaten himself to death: The Chief Medical Examiner’s verdict raised questions among the health community, with many people refusing to believe Best killed himself by repeatedly hitting himself with a blunt object until he died. Erin Elizabeth of HNN [Health Nut News] described the ruling of Best’s death as “confusing,” saying: “How does one kill themselves by hitting themselves with a blunt object? Repeatedly?” Another conspiracy-mongering website, Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, posed the same sarcastic question: So did he lie down under a garage door and let it hit him “multiple times” or did he beat himself to death with a baseball bat? How does that work? Add to the very few actual articles on his death — this man was described as one of Trump’s “senior” HHS officials working with Alex Azar. Things that make you go hmmmm. There’s a fallacious assumption underlying this notion, however: namely, that blunt force injuries can only be sustained in the course of a physical attack by an assailant (or oneself). But that isn’t how forensic pathologists define “blunt force injury.” According to Prahlow and Byard’s Atlas of Forensic Pathology, a blunt force injury is any “resulting from impact with a blunt object, i.e., one that does not possess any sharp edges”: Examples of blunt objects include hammers, baseball bats, fists, the interior surfaces of vehicles, roads, trees, floors, walls, furniture, and even fluid objects such as bodies of water (if the speed of impact is sufficiently high). Medical University of South Carolina pathology professor Nicholas I. Batalis observes in “Forensic Autopsy of Blunt Force Trauma” (Medscape, 2016) that blunt force injuries can be caused in myriad ways that have nothing to with assault and battery (emphasis added): Deaths resulting from blunt force trauma are some of the most common cases encountered by the practicing forensic pathologist. Whereas other forms of traumatic death (e.g., gunshot wounds, sharp force injuries) occur under a relatively limited number of circumstances, deaths resulting from blunt force trauma occur in a variety of scenarios. For instance, almost all transportation fatalities — including those involving motor vehicle collisions, pedestrians being struck by vehicles, airplane crashes, and boating incidents — result from blunt force trauma. Other deaths resulting from blunt force trauma involve jumping or falling from heights, blast injuries, and being struck by a firm object, such as a fist, crowbar, bat, or ball. Bite wounds and chop injuries may be considered variants of blunt force trauma, sharp force trauma, or a class of injuries unto themselves. Blunt force trauma is routinely involved in cases classified as accidents, as well as in cases of suicide and homicide. Finally, we put the known facts of the case to Thomas Sporn, M.D., Chief of the Section of Pulmonary and Thoracic Pathology at Duke University Medical Center, and asked him if a ruling of suicide makes sense. He responded via e-mail to say: Jumping off a building and striking the (blunt) pavement would result in blunt force injuries, as would, say, darting into traffic, and of course most aviation and motor vehicle fatalities are from blunt force injuries. So it’s definitely possible to sustain self-inflicted blunt force injuries, depending on the circumstances.",1
"A federal judge has not ordered that Vince Foster’s remains to help determine if Bill and Clinton were behind his death. Conspiracy theories the Bill and Hillary Clinton had Arkansas attorney and deputy White House counsel Vince Foster murdered in 1993 because he knew explosive information that would jeopardize the political careers of the Clintons and other world leaders. In 1994, Foster’s death was officially ruled a suicide by special counsel Robert Fiske Jr., the Washington Post reported at the time: Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. concluded that Foster’s death in Fort Marcy Park last July was a suicide. The Fiske investigation involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses; also DNA tests, microscopes and lasers. All that effort resolved many of the lingering mysteries surrounding Foster’s death. But the largest mystery remained: Why did the stings of Washington life, endured by so many, prove fatal for Vincent W. Foster Jr.? Fiske’s report tells the story of a man stretched until he broke. As simple – and as mysterious – as that. In the months since Foster’s body was found resting on a slope beside a Civil War cannon, the airwaves and printing presses have been filled with theories of conspiracy and intrigue. Rumors about his death shook the stock market and dogged the president. Foster came to be seen by many as the key to a vault of dark secrets about some of the most powerful people in the world. Vince Foster, a childhood friend of President Clinton, reportedly suffered from depression and anxiety in his role as deputy White House counsel before his death in 1993. Friske’s report concluded that Foster “blamed himself’ for scrutiny the Clinton transition team faced, including accusations of elitism, corner cutting and incompetent screening. The report said that Foster considered retiring from the position in January 1993 but could not bare to face the embarrassment of returning to Arkansas a “failure.” The FBI vault contains extensive documentation on the investigation into Vince Foster’s suicide. The bureau even appears to address specific questions that have fueled conspiracy theories, like the position of Foster’s body, the location of the gun in his hand, the lack of reports of gunfire, just to name a few. Those details have only seemed to fuel conspiracy theories that the Clintons murdered Vince Foster over the years — culminating in the most recent one that a federal judge has ordered the exhumation of Foster’s body to re-examine his cause and manner of death. That report first appeared at The Last Line of Defense, a website that clearly states “all articles should be considered satirical,” and that it cites facts that “don’t necessarily exist.” The Vince Foster exhumation report, which appeared under the headline. “BREAKING: Trey Gowdy Just Had A Federal Judge Issue An Order To Exhume A Body,” definitely meets that criteria: For the first time in history, a US Congressman has asked that a body be exhumed in connection with an investigation by a House intelligence committee. Judge Harmon Watson agreed to issue the order for a work crew in Fairfax, Virginia to exhume the body of Vince Foster for autopsy. The order came just minutes after evidence turned up in the case of a murdered reporter who had an “if anything ever happens to me” letter delivered to his publication that implicated Hillary Clinton in a 23-year-old crime, which put it right around the time of Foster’s supposed “suicide.” Foster’s body has already been removed from the ground and is currently being transferred to the Naval Hospital in Norfolk to undergo an autopsy to look for a very specific cause of death. That information is being kept a closely guarded secret for now by Gowdy and the other federal prosecutors, since only the killer would know. The false report that Vince Foster’s body has been exhumed was quickly shared on social media more than 20,000 times. Many who read and shared the report didn’t realize that it came from a “satire” website that does not publish factual stories. There are no new developments into Vince Foster’s death — but that likely won’t stop new conspiracy theories.",1
"In February 2019, an image supposedly showing an eagle catching a drone was widely circulated on Facebook along with the caption “The Picture of the Century. Nature defeats Technology”:  This photograph received hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook, but many viewers weren’t exactly sure what this photograph depicted. Was the image created with digital editing software? Did this really capture an eagle attacking the equipment of an amateur drone photographer? This is in fact a genuine photograph of an eagle catching a drone. It was taken by photographer Koen Van Weel in March 2016 and documents a trained eagle from the “Guard from Above” company wrapping its talons around a drone during a police exercise in the Netherlands. The image is available via Getty Images. where it is presented with the caption “An eagle of the Guard from Above company, grasps a drone during a police exercise in Katwijk, on March 7, 2016. The bird of prey can get drones from the air by catching them with his legs.” A 2016 video report from BBC News showed these eagles, and other birds of prey, in action with drones:   With reports of near-misses with aircraft, invasions of privacy and security breaches, drones are not always welcome flyers. And as the number of drones in the sky increases, the authorities need to be sure there is a way to bring them down without any danger to those on the ground. BBC Click’s Lara Lewington looks at the technology being used to bring troublesome drones down to earth including one very low-tech solution being tried by police in the Netherlands — an eagle that goes after the unmanned vehicles as if they were its prey. While eagles and other birds of prey are certainly capable of taking down a drone, some groups have argued that these animals are being put in danger when tasked with that activity. Here’s an excerpt from a National Geographic article arguing against the use of bald eagles to deter drones:  The biggest problem is the very obvious danger to the eagles. As demonstrated by the Mythbusters crew, who are among the preeminent scientific experimenters of our time, drone blades, especially carbon fiber ones, can cause serious damage to an animal. If an eagle were to misjudge its attack, or if the drone operator were to take evasive or defense maneuvers, a bird could be struck by the blades and seriously injured or killed … Even if birds are well trained and are unexpectedly effective at avoiding rotors, how many eagles are we willing to risk if something goes wrong? Seriously, bald eagles have been through enough. Bald eagles were taken off the Endangered Species List less than ten years ago, which is about 15 minutes in evolutionary time. Humans nearly wiped them out through a combination of pesticides (primarily DDT), habitat destruction, and illegal shooting. In 1963, bald eagles hit a population low in the United States of just 487 pairs. Since then they’ve battled back and are just now repopulating old territories and establishing a stable population Guards from Above wrote on their website that “animal welfare is very important” and noted that they are currently studying the possible impact on the birds’ claws:",0
"""Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus defended the 2016 Republican Party platform ahead of its convention in a July 17 interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd. While the platform isn’t yet in its final form, many observers have said the document so far lands to the right on social issues. Todd asked Priebus about the platform’s position on same-sex marriage. He referenced one draft that says """"the data, the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion that every child deserves a married mom and dad"""" — based on claims that children raised in a traditional household are healthier and less likely to engage in crime and substance abuse. """"It’s implying somehow that children of same-sex couples are more likely to be addicts, to engage in crime,"""" Todd said. """"Do you mean to have it imply that?"""" Priebus replied that it’s possible for children of same-sex parents and single parents to have successful lives, but the best scenario is for children to grow up in a traditional opposite-sex household. """"The best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad,"""" Priebus said. """"However, it doesn't mean at all that single parents or same-sex parents, that any parent in America can't love a child, can't raise a child, and that child can't be successful and loved. It doesn't mean that. It just means what the facts say."""" Do """"the facts say"""" that """"the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad"""" as opposed to same-sex parents? We’ve rated two similar claims  in the past, and not much has changed since we last looked into it in 2014. If anything, the scholarly consensus that children can fare just as well in same-sex households has strengthened. """"The consensus is overwhelming that those children do very well in those (same-sex parent) families, and there’s no harm or bad consequence that occurs because of those parents not being opposite sex,"""" said Ellen Perrin, a professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine who has researched this question. What the research shows Researchers at Columbia Law School reviewed scholarly works about the well-being of children living with gay or lesbian parents spanning the past three decades. The researchers found 78 relevant articles, and of those, 74 concluded that children of same-sex parents fare no worse than children of opposite-sex parents. Six of these articles were published in the last three years. The studies examine topics such as adolescent well-being, child physical and emotional health, family functioning and the effect of homophobic stigmatization. """"Taken together, this research forms an overwhelming scholarly consensus, based on over three decades of peer-reviewed research, that having a gay or lesbian parent does not harm children,"""" the Columbia researchers wrote. That leaves four articles that argue children face more risks with opposite-sex parents than they do with same-sex parents. However, the Columbia researchers say these studies are problematic because only a minority of the child subjects grew up with same-sex parents. Most subjects of these four studies grew up with opposite-sex parents but one of the parents eventually came out as gay or lesbian, often causing family breakup or turmoil. Some of this research conflates family composition and structure with family stability and history, said Gary Gates, an expert in LGBT demography at the University of California Los Angeles. Social science research suggests marriage — and not necessarily the gender makeup of that marriage — is associated with stability. """"In other words, studies that compare children in long-term intact families with same-sex couple parents show that they generally do as well as kids in long-term intact families with different-sex parents,"""" Gates said. Gates co-authored an overview of contemporary research about LGBT parents. The report found that LGBT parents and their children are doing """"quite well,"""" but research into the subject face problems like getting a large and diverse sample size. And there is little research into subcategories, like sibling dynamics among children with same-sex parent families or domestic violence. Perrin added that there is much more research into lesbian female parents than there is into gay male parents, but that imbalance is starting to even out, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of gay marriage and more male gay couples are having children. In any case, evidence supporting Priebus’s claim is limited and problematic. """"There’s no scholarly data that suggests this is a problem,"""" Perrin said. We did not hear back from Priebus. Our ruling Priebus said, """"What the facts say"""" is ... """"the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad,""""  as opposed to having same-sex parents. The limited pieces of research that appear to support Priebus’ claim have been called into question. And overall, scholarly research shows that what matters to children is the quality and stability of the parenting, rather than the parents’ particular sex, gender or sexual orientation.""",1
"The panel voted 10 to 0, with one abstention, against approval, saying data from a single clinical trial was not strong enough to justify approval, especially since some data from the trial was missing.
